welcome to scratch coding with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today we're going to create something like this it's ultimate pong there's powerups and tricks you're going to love creating this so you can play with your friends first we're going to create a regular pawn game get rid of scratch and draw a background with no outline we need one rectangle that's the whole playing chord then we need a slightly different color on each side and just for looks i want a white line down the middle and i can hold shift down to make sure the line's straight there's not going to be any code for the background now i need some sprites i'm going to need a ball and a paddle and of course you can change the color of the paddle but i'll just leave it like this to save us some time the code for the paddle needs to tell it to turn this way and then i want to move it all the way over to the left that's going to be negative 227 we'll just go ahead and type in zero to put it in the middle whenever the game starts we want it to go to the middle and point in the right direction we'll call this one left paddle we need the paddle to move up and down since this paddle's on the left it's going to move up when i press w and down when i press s you can put the code for it when w is pressed change y by 10 and that works and when s is pressed change y by negative 10. but there's a delay when you do that it should work just fine but for some reason it doesn't work really well when two people are playing and so i'm not going to put it in the code when that key is pressed i'm going to have it in a forever loop so forever it's going to keep checking to see if the button is pressed and if key w is pressed we're going to move up by 10 and if s is pressed we're going to move down by 10. just works so much better it's a lot smoother it's not as jerky i don't know if you can tell the difference now we're going to duplicate the left paddle to give us a right paddle and we'll just put it the same place but on the right hand side and it's going to go up and down when the up arrow and the down arrow is pressed works really well okay for the ball let's just start off smaller and forever we want it to move and bounce when the game first starts we want it to start in the middle at 0 0 but we want it to change to not go just straight back and forth change 90 to 95 to be off a little bit there now it's not just bouncing straight back and forth we're going to need a couple variables to keep score left score and right score and if it touches this left wall then the right player should score a point and if it touches this color and hits the right wall then the left player should score a point if touching the left color blue then change the right score by one so forever it's going to check and if it's touching that color blue right here then right scores a point problem is it's looping through this so fast that it gets a couple of points every time it touches the wall so we need to slow it down a little bit so it'll give them a point and then it'll wait until it's not touching that color anymore copy that so that the left player can make some points and this color we're going to suck up some of this color on the right and in the beginning of the game we need the score to go back to zero set less score to zero and set right score to zero now we just need the ball to bounce off the paddles if the ball touches the left paddle will change direction to make it change directions we'll tell it to go its current direction plus 170. and just like we did for the weight until not touching the blue wall we need to make it wait until not touching the paddle or it'll keep changing directions so if the ball hits the left paddle it'll just change directions want to duplicate that so that it'll bounce off the right paddle and we'll make it bounce just a little different instead of 170 we'll go with 190 and we can just change to the large readout so we'll have the score at the top and that's all the code you need for a regular game of pong to play with two players but let's make it even more fun let's add a new sprite and pick the star now i'm just adding some fun code to make the star twinkle and spin a little bit when the program starts the star is going to hide and go to a random position we pick a random number for x and a random number for y somewhere near the middle when the game first starts he won't be there we'll let the players play for just a few seconds and then he'll show up and then forever if he gets hit by the ball he's going to move to another place now what this power up is going to do is make the ball go faster so we're going to need a variable for the ball speed so this is the star code and if the star is touching the ball he's going to go somewhere else and we need to make the ball go faster so we'll set speed let's just make it 11 for a couple of seconds let's make it 12 for a couple of seconds and then we'll change the speed to 8. so we need to set the speed to 8 in the beginning so that'll be our normal speed and we need to make the ball go that fast right now the ball is moving 10 steps in this forever loop he needs to be moving speed all right let's see if that powerup works when we start playing it's going at a speed of eight and it definitely got faster there for a couple of seconds when we hit the star i figured out a cheat that's kind of funny you can put it in the code for the ball instead of pointing in the other direction whenever you hit the paddle you can point towards the other paddle so when the ball hits the left paddle it'll point towards the right paddle so no matter where the right paddle is whenever the left paddle hits the ball the ball is going to go towards the right paddle that would be very sneaky to put that code in your program whenever you were playing your friends don't do that unless they have a really good sense of humor i'm going to change that back we don't need to be able to see speed anymore go to our variables and turn that off another thing that's fun that you never see in regular pong is a lightning bolt flying out of the paddle and making you turn invisible but since we're writing the code we can do that okay this lightning bolt is going to hide and turn sideways he's got a point in the direction zero make him smaller and for the left lightning bolt if i press d he's going to start off at the left paddle then he's going to show he's going to be visible and then he's going to glide over to the right at the same y position so at the same y position is going to make him just go straight across and then he needs to hide again and we'll make another one to go the other direction we'll call him left lightning and right lightning and he'll shoot when the left arrow is pressed he starts at the right paddle and goes all the way to the left oh but he's going backwards let's flip him around he'll start pointing in the direction 180. and you can only shoot one at a time now when you get hit by a lightning bolt you disappear your paddle disappears so this is left paddle if he's touching the right's lightning he's going to hide for a couple of seconds or maybe just one second and then he'll show again for the right paddle if he's ever touching less lightning then he's going to hide and wait for a second and then show again it works so there's a few ideas i had about making pong even more fun if you think of some more powerups comment below and we'll figure out how to code it like and subscribe below so you don't miss any of the next games and it'll make it easier for people to find them this
