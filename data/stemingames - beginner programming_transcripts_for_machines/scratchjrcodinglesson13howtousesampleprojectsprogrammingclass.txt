welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write for today's lesson we're going to explore some builtin help that you'll find in scratch junior i know you're familiar with the area down here that has all your projects have you looked across the top the question mark or this book let's look what's in this book there's tabs down at the bottom and this this one says interface guide it shows you all the different parts of your screen so for example if you don't know what this little yellow tab is over on the top right you can click on it and it says that's project information that's where you can change the title of your project see when the project was created and share the project so if you have any questions about part of your screen what it does you can just click on it and play with it or you could come here to the interface guide and read about it the paint editor guide shows you all the different parts of the paint editor if you've wondered what the scissors do and you couldn't figure it out in the paint editor you can see that that's cut after selecting the cut tool you can tap the character or shape to remove it from the canvas so you click on the scissors and then you would click on part of your picture and it'll cut it out and there's one more guide in here the blocks guide that goes through all the different blocks and tells you what they do it's really easy to just pull a block into the programming area and play with it and see what it does but if you would rather read about it or you can't figure it out then you can come to the blocks guide and read about what each block does you can read about all the different triggering blocks and what each of those does the different motion blocks all the different looks blocks the purple ones what does each one of those do the sound blocks all the different control blocks are the orange ones and finally the end blocks the red ones it tells you what each of those does looking across the top again we could go home or go to scratch junior but this is the same question mark that we saw whenever we were looking at the projects let me go ahead and go back home so you can see see that's the same question mark we were just in the books that's where we found all the guides let's go see what's under the question mark there's a video here you could watch these are sample projects scratch junior gives you eight sample projects to look and see what the code does for example under the c let me click on that you'll see in this project there's four characters there's one scene i'll click the green flag to see what it does so we have a sea horse going up and down and the fish looks like they're dancing with each other let's look at the code to see what the seahorse is doing so he's moving to the right at the same time that he's going up and then down up and then down in a loop oh i didn't see the starfish down here let's see what he's doing this set his speed and then this code makes him turn to the right and then he turns to the left two and then he turns to the right again let's see if we change his speed look how fast he's going now let's change something that the seahorse does let's make him go up five he's jumping up a lot higher now let's change something about the green fish let's make him twist you see that this is different than your other projects you can't add a scene you can't add characters but you can play with the code just to learn how to do it it's a great place to practice if i go back into under the sea after i left that project you see the changes that i made did not stay so you can't mess these projects up you can't save your changes but you also can't mess them up so feel free to come in here and just play with them let's see what the project dance is all about i'll make this full screen and then we'll click the green flag well that was fun in the first scene this makes the sound this makes the boy move and it repeats two times and then it waits and then goes to scene two and in scene two this is its recorded sound and it repeats all this twice and it moves over to the right and goes to scene three and then in scene three this is repeated three times and then all of this is repeated two times did you know that you could have a loop inside of a loop you could add anything that you want into the code and see how it changes things yeah inside that loop i made it go up but for today what you need to do is come into these sample projects and just play around with it and open them up and look at the code and see what they're doing come look at these animals and see that whenever you tap the pig it's gonna make this sound and then jump up or when you when you tap the horse what does it do it plays this recorded sound and then he wiggles back and forth so play around with those sample projects see what you can learn from them and that's the end of this lesson this free coding lesson was provided by stem in games watch more lessons and keep practicing so you can create new worlds and games and make your ideas come to life i'll see you next time bye
