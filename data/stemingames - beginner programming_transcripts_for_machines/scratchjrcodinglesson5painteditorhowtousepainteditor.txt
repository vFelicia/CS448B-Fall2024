welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today you're going to create your own characters when i created this game i had to create these alien characters they weren't already in scratch i had to create these bullets to shoot the aliens and the arrows to make my rocket ship move today you're going to create your own character i'm going to show you how by creating this spinner you will need the scratch junior app on your ipad android tablet or computer scratch jr is a free download and you'll have to get it so that you can do coding with us launch scratch junior and click on the home icon click on the plus to start a new project you can hold your finger down on whatever character is on the screen and click the x to delete it up here you can pick any background that you want we've done that on all the exercises that we've done so far the new thing that we're going to do today is learn how to draw our own characters you can put characters on the screen right here by clicking this plus the ones up at the top are the ones that i've created you'll see the alien that i used and the arrows that i used to do that game these are all the characters that come with scratch junior but if they don't have the character that you want or you want to draw your own you can just click on this little paintbrush these are different shapes that you can make the squiggly line means that you can draw whatever kind of squiggly line or straight line or anything that you want this left arrow undoes things that you do the right arrow will redo it back this circle thing makes a circle square thing makes a square or a rectangle triangle you guessed it if i pick a different color then i can be doing the same kind of thing in the other color these change how thick it is so if i have a triangle picked and a really thick line in the color red it's going to draw me a thick tr red triangle this bucket over here dumps a bucket of paint inside whatever you want i'll pick some yellow paint and if this is the character that i like i could put it right on my screen and like the other character i can hold down on this and delete it and i want to do a different character the spinner thing that i made is a little tricky i need a circle in the middle and it really has to be in the middle of my screen or it's going to so wobble just use a circle and drag a little red circle there i want the blades of my spinner to be blue and instead of dragging a circle i'll make those an oval shape and i want to fill it in with blue and then i don't have to keep drawing a bunch of different blades i can take my stamp tool which is really just a copy and copy that copy it again how many blades do we need about five the arrow will let me drag things away to wherever i want this rotate lets me rotate them and then pick my select tool and drag them what i'm drawing for you today is a little complicated but you can draw anything that you want when i'm happy with what i've drawn i'll click the check to save it and it sticks it right there on the screen now i want a stem to hold up my spinner so i have to have another character that's just the stick and you'll see in my other project i did already have a stick but i'm going to do a new stick we will have blues fine we'll make it about this thick and it needs to come from the middle about right there whoops got to pick my drawing line and i want my spinner to be in front so a lot of times we have the screen flag to start our programs but today i want the spinner to spin whenever i touch it whenever i tap on it or whenever i click on it with my arrow so once i click on it it's going to spin and keep doing that so that would be good if it was a windmill if the wind just kept blowing it and blowing it but what i want to do today is make it spin when i touch it so i'm going to tell it to just spin a little bit 50 times this you'll remember makes it go faster if i pick the one on the right it goes faster so it's going to spin 50 times faster then i'm going to slow it down a little bit and then make it spin about 20 more times and then slow it down even more and spin about five more times so i want to make it look like i touch it and then it spins for a while and then it slows down and then it finally stops and then if i touch it again it goes fast and slows down and stops so it says do the code whenever you touch it make the spinner go really fast for 50 times then medium speed for 20 times and then slow speed for five more times let's look at the different parts in the paint editor this first one over here if you click on this that'll help you undo something that you've done and if you change your mind then this arrow to the right will redo something that you've undone all of these are different shapes that you can make and going to number four you can change the name of whatever it is that you've drawn right here these scissors cut something basically delete it this stamp makes another copy of something you use seven these arrows to rotate something make it spin around arrow select something and then you can drag it around and move it around on the screen nine is you click the check whenever you want to save something 10 is a paint bucket whenever you want to fill in something a certain color you just dump a bucket of paint on it 11 is a camera whenever you want to take a picture of what you've done 12 all of these are all the different colors that you have available 13 these are all the different lines that you have if you want a really thick line you would pick this one if you want a really thin line you would pick this one if we go to this old project i did a long time ago and we wanted to pretend that the students in here were learning some math i could create a math problem in here i'm going to select the black marker and the squiggly line means i can write whatever i want i'm going to write 1 plus 1. and save that and it put that right on my screen if we wanted some birds flying in the sky for this project i could go to create a new sprite click on the paint brush well i didn't like the way that one turned out neither one of those let's cut those out do you ever draw a bird like that cut that and draw with the black all right i'll save my birds we need to make them smaller too they're flying out of that tree right there there now it's your turn what would you like to draw after you create your character you could of course make it jump or roll or do whatever you want but the main point of this lesson is to be able to draw your own character and if you can draw your own character then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free kids coding lesson was provided by stem and games subscribe watch more lessons and keep practicing and soon you will be creating new worlds and games and making your ideas come to life i'll see you next time
