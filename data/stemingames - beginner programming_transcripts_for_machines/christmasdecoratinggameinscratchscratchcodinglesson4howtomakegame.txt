welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today we're going to create something like this tap the penguin it's a game when you tap the penguin it decorates your scene i got six points let's create a new project and see how to do it i'll remove scratch cat and pick a new character i like the penguin to start let's make our penguin go to a random position let's make him do that ten times that happens way too fast so let's wait one second in between him moving around we're going to get a point every time we click on him so when this sprite is clicked we're going to score a point how do we keep track of how many points we have let's look at the orange blocks variables a variable is like a container for your programs you can use a variable to hold a number or some other information for you the most important thing about today's lesson is that you learn how to make a variable and use a variable variables are very important when you're coding let's make a variable to keep track of our score and we can simply call it score it doesn't really matter you can name it anything you want but to help make your code make sense it's good to use a name that reflects what it does now that we have a variable called score it's available for us to use the value of score is also on our screen now we can set our variable to whatever we want we can hide it we can show it but for our game what we want to do is change our variable by one every time the sprite is clicked you can see the scores going up at the beginning of our game we want to change the score to zero so you have to start over and start when the green flag is clicked let's see how that looks once he stops moving around i can still click on him and keep racking up the points so let's hide him when the game is over to be able to see him is the way he looks so let's look under the looks blocks i can't tell how long i have left and so i'm going to do a countdown let me make a new variable we'll call it time in the beginning we're going to set time to 10. and in the loop i'm going to count down on my time now i can see the score and the amount of time i have left let's see how that looks i need to unhide him show when i click the green flag i want him to show again and now my timer's counting down i can see how much time i have left and what my score is so that's the most important part of our game today the rest of it is just for fun let's pick a backdrop and some more sprites i only want my other sprites to show up once i have some points so i need to go to their code let's go to the code for the ball when the green flag is clicked i want them to hide but when my variable score i need an operator if my score is equal to one then i want him to show up again so when the green flag is clicked this code is going to check the score and see if it's one and then show our first ornament that's a problem because it's just going to do it once it's never going to check again so it'll never happen i'm going to have to make it check and then check again and check again and check again let's see if that works yeah it was gone until i got at least one point so i don't really need this other wind green flag clicked i can stick the hide right in there now i don't have any code yet for the sun the star or the gift but i can just go to the balls code and drag it and let it go on the gift drag it again let it go on the star and the same thing for the sun so now when i go and look the gift has code let's only get the gift when you get two points and a star when you get three in the sun when you get four i'm going to duplicate some more presents and change a couple of them's costumes and make this one you need five points to get this one duplicate the ornament a few times and get a polar bear he needs code and we don't get the polar bear we get eight points all right let's play it now we got everything if i wanted to make the game harder i could make the penguin a lot smaller change size to 50 instead of 100 that's 50 percent i see a problem one last thing sometimes the penguin is behind the presents and we wouldn't be able to click on him we want him to go to the front back would be behind other stuff let's make him go to the front and see if that fixes it yes he's in front of the presence now and in front of the sun time's up our variables work our game works now it's your turn get a character make him go to 10 random positions and try to click on him go to the orange variables and click on make a variable so that you can keep score if you can create a game that when you click on your character you get points then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free coding lesson was
