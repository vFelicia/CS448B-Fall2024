welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write today you're going to create something like this it's a dance party did you get the scratch junior app after the first lesson like i said last time you need an ipad or android tablet with the scratch junior app it's a free download from the apple app store or google play i downloaded scratch junior onto my laptop computer that is available too so get someone to get scratch junior for you however you can get it so that you can do coding with us when you launch scratch junior you'll get this screen go to home you may have other projects here if you've been playing around or if you were with us for lesson one but to create a new project click the plus when you start a project the default character this is called a sprite will appear in scratch junior a sprite is just another name for the characters animals and other things that you control in scratch junior if you want to change this default sprite just click and press on the sprite until an x appears and then click the x and he'll go away to select a new sprite you go to the plus to select a new background you go to this landscape icon and we're going to do a dance party so first i'm going to click the dance stage i'm going to go select the dance stage so this is all my different backgrounds and here is our dance stage with the light shining down on the stage and then i'm going to pick a couple of characters to dance on the stage so click the plus over on the left we want a boy and a girl to dance so we'll pick a girl and then the check mark to select her and i'll just move her move her over a little bit as soon as you hold down on something you have to start moving it if i just hold down on it without starting to move it'll think i want to delete it so i have to hold down on it and then move really quick or it's going to select it to delete it you'll get the hang of it it takes a little practice so now i want to select a boy i'll pick the click on the plus and go down to where the boys and girls are which boy should we pick and then check mark and then he's on the stage so we'll drag him over if you were with us for the last lesson you'll know that this area down here is the programming area and whatever you want the sprite to do has to go into this area well what's new for this lesson is we have two sprites on the page two characters on the page and you have to remember to pick the right one when you're doing the movements for them or the programming for that character you see the boy here the boy is selected right here if i select the girl then you see the little girl picture right here anything that goes right here is going to make the girl move when i pick the boy anything that goes right here will make the boy move you'll see so if i do a right movement it makes the boy move right if i select the girl you'll see she doesn't have any programming yet let's make her go left and if we connect a couple of blocks together then she go left and then right let's make her dance we're going to a green flag to start the program and then go back to the movement blocks which are br blue we'll make her kind of spin to the right a little bit and spin to the left and then jump let's see what that looks like does that look like she's dancing now if we pick the boy we'll see he doesn't have much let's make him jump and then move and then spin a little bit and spin a little more let's see what that looks like if i click this green flag up here it makes the girl move but not the boy do you know why let's look at her code she has a green flag this tells her start whenever somebody clicks the green flag the boy doesn't have that we forgot to put that on there another good thing to do is put an ending block at the end of the code so that tells it to stop but for today's lesson we don't really want him to stop dancing this means just keep going and going and going and going so when i put this on here he'll just keep dancing and keep dancing and keep dancing so let me stop him put him back to where he was in the beginning and click the green flag and that'll make him both dance but she's not still dancing what happened let's stop him what's wrong with her code she doesn't have this repeat block that'll make her just keep dancing forever this little arrow here makes them go back to their starting place and it works they're both dancing are you happy with the way they're dancing you could add more spins and higher jumps and do whatever you want it's your movie that you're making this is going to make it into a bigger screen and then we click the green and they're dancing on the stage there's a way that we can bring some music in here but the only kind of music that they have is this pop let's see what that sounds like is that close enough to some music we're going to tell it whenever you hear whenever you um see the green flag clicked then just pop forever what does that sound like is that good enough for dance music now it's your turn open your scratch junior app click the home click the plus to create a new project you'll probably have scratched the cat whenever you first open it up and you could keep him or you could decide to use different ones get the stage background or if you want your characters to dance somewhere else that's fine pick any two characters that you want add as many movements as you want and make it repeat and then select your other character and see he has no programming done yet you didn't do it yet and then add whatever movements you want for him and make it repeat and then you could use your own voice to make some sounds for their dance or you could add some pops and make that repeat if you can add two characters and make them both dance then congratulations you've mastered the second lesson what else would you like to make your character do would you like to make a longer movie with him would you like to turn him into a video game keep practicing and you'll be creating games and longer stories soon i'll be back to help you on your learning journey be sure to watch the next lesson of scratch junior coding and click subscribe below so
