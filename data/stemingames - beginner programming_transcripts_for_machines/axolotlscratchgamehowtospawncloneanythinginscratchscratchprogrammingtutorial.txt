welcome to scratch coding with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today we're going to create a game where you can spawn axolotls you can pick different colors and spawn as many as you want if you're a novice at scratch then you can remix my code and i'll give you a link to that project in the description below if you're more hardcore then you can just remix my project axolotl resources and write all the code yourself if you're a code ninja then you may want to create a new project and get your own resources and write your code so we're going to start at novice level there's a link below to my project spawn axolotls you can remix this project and change whatever you want first let's run the program and see what it does when you click on the egg it spawns axolotls you can also hit the space bar this is the easter color axolotls there's also camouflage neon color and this button makes an axolotl let's keep an eye on him that changes color as he goes along so the axolotls just go off the screen a little bit turn around and come back in another direction as they go back and forth they get smaller and darker the axolotls go at different speeds and as they get smaller into the background you can really tell that some of them are going really slow and others are going fast it's fun to just create a bunch of these and let them swim around like you have an aquarium let's look at the code for the egg when the program starts the first type of axolotl that it's going to make is this purple kind and it goes to the front layer because you want the egg in front of all the other axolotls that have been created when this sprite is clicked when the egg is clicked it makes the egg move it glides a little bit and it creates a clone of the type of axolotl that's selected it does the same thing when the space key is pressed notice on these buttons whichever one i select has a yellow border let's look at the code for the buttons when i click the easter button it's going to select this purple axolotl as the type but you can't see it okay this is the purple one brown yellow and this one is all colors so it's going to select this purple one as the type and it's going to broadcast easter to let all the other buttons know that easter is selected let's look at the costumes for the easter button b is just the normal easter and b2 is the one that has a yellow border for when it's selected and you'll see the code whenever it's clicked it selects the one that has the yellow border b2 if anything else is clicked then it changes back to the one that has easter not selected when the game starts or if it's clicked on it's going to change to b2 because that's the one that's highlighted but if any of these other ones are selected then it's going to change it back to just b which is not a yellow border same thing for all these other buttons they have a couple of different costumes and they switch to the highlighted one whenever they're clicked on so all this extra code whenever it receives these messages is just to change the border around the biggest part of this is setting the right type so if camo is clicked on then it's going to change the type that's just a variable to brown if neon is clicked on then it's going to change the type to yellow so these buttons all they do is set the variable type so you don't know what type of axolotl to create the axolotl actually gets created in the egg code right here whenever it's clicked create a clone of whatever type is selected and inside the axolotls when he starts as a clone it has all the code to move back and forth to get smaller to get darker so the main sprite is hidden whenever the green flag is clicked but every time it starts as a clone it's going to pick a random color and a random speed between 6 and 10 it sets the size tells him to go in front of all these other axolotls but then go backward so you're not in front of the egg or in front of the buttons point in a random direction and you're going to be moving left and right not spinning all around and forever you just keep moving back and forth as long as they're pretty big it's going to make it smaller and make it go slower because when things are further away it looks like they're going slower also when things are further away especially if they're in the water then they're not going to look so bright so we change the brightness as they go back we also go to next costume i didn't show you that we're going through 40 different costumes to make him swim around so the motion just going through next costume next costume makes it look like he's swimming and the code for all these axolotls is the same when they start as a clone they do the same thing and this random color effect even though i picked neon it's going to be a random neon kind of color they're not all the same because of this random color effect if you were to remix this project what would you want to add what could we change to make it even better leave a comment below about what should be added to make this even better and after you've made changes yourself add your project to my axolotl studio if you're not a novice and you're more hardcore then you may want to start with this i'm also going to share this project axolotl resources i've given you the background and the costumes for the sprites but not the code you'll have to write your own code let's just write something real quick so for this yellow axolotl we need when green flag clicked and we need him to show he's too small he's at 20 right there let's set him to 40. go to a random position we don't want him spinning around so we'll set the rotation style to left and right and forever we want him to move and then bounce when he gets to the edge we want him to do this when he starts as a clone so we can have more than one axolotl so that's down here in the control blocks when i start as a clone so create a clone of myself and there he goes now all these are yellow we can put this code in the all axolotl colors create a clone of myself oh and i need to make him show but they're still not changing color i forgot to make him change costumes costumes is going to be in the looks we just need the next costume block we also want the code for this one to change costumes yeah that makes them look like they're swimming when they start we want the original one to be hidden though we want the clones to show but we want the original one to hide i want to add this set color effect too so we can get some variation in the colors and this one needs to hide when the green flag is clicked and you can change the speed and the size and the color and everything and just do as much as you want with this starting with my project axolotl resources but if you're a code ninja then you can do everything all on your own just do a new project and choose a backdrop that would be a good one for some axolotls to swim around in or you can upload a backdrop the backdrop from my other project i just did a screenshot when i was playing minecraft just click upload backdrop and then select the file that you got off the internet or you saved while you were playing i'll just select this jpeg that i made background.jpg and after it imports we have another background drag it to cover the whole screen and just resize it position it however you want next we need some sprites i uploaded a sprite for the egg again i got that off minecraft i just copied that and edited it out and made the background transparent to make a png file and then just resized and positioned that and that looks just like my other game for the axolotls we have to upload a sprite and i found a gif file on the internet that had a lot of different costumes let me show you get one gif file that moves and once it's imported in look at the costumes for that that has all the different colors there's 40 white ones 40 yellow ones 40 brown ones i'm gonna just right click on this axolotl and duplicate it rename it yellow and delete all the costumes that aren't yellow and now it's just the yellow one let's add a little code for this guy forever go to the next costume so forever he goes to the next costume and just like in the other projects we can make clones of him and make him move around and change colors and and do whatever we want so whether you're a novice hardcore or a code ninja add your projects to my axolotl studio if you enjoyed the video and you like my
