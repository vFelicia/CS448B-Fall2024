welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write you will need the scratch junior app on your ipad android tablet or computer scratch junior is a free download and you'll have to get it so that you can do coding with us today you're going to learn how to bring your own pictures into scratch junior and you're going to create something like this knock knock who's there hatch hat you bless you this is lesson number nine we're going to use a lot of the things that we've already learned in previous lessons so if you haven't seen those you may need to watch lessons one through seven first i have different scenes set up over here on the right we don't really need that i just made that to show you a couple different ways to time this because the guy in orange is wanting to tell a knock knock joke to his friend in green so he can't say knock knock at the same time as the boy in green says who who's there he has to say knock knock who's there then the orange says hatch and then the green says hatch who and then the orange guy finishes the joke by saying bless you it has to happen in order that way we've used message blocks before and we used them a lot in lesson 8 but i want to show you one other way that you could do it we have the orange the boy in orange starting when you hit the green flag he says knock knock then he waits for 15 and then he says hatch and then he waits for 20 and then he says bless you the boy in green he waits in the beginning he's just waiting for the boy in orange to say knock knock and then he says who's there then he waits for 15 and then he says hat you so if you can get all these timings right like do you wait for 10 or do you wait for 15 in the beginning you can just play around with it let's make it bigger and watch knock knock who's there hatch hat too bless you so that's one way to do it but this is a more advanced lesson so we're going to play with these message blocks and if you look at the way i've done it the joke starts with the boy in orange when when i hit the green flag he says knock knock and then he sends an orange message now let's look at the boy in green when he sees an orange message he says who's there and he sends a red message and if the boy in orange sees that somebody has sent a red message he says hatch and he sends a yellow message and if the boy in green sees a yellow message he says hat you and sends a green message and then the boy in orange finishes the joke when he sees a green message he says bless you so are you ready to make a knock knock joke start a new project remove the default character and go to the backgrounds you saw from my other project those were not characters that you find in scratch junior when you first open it up this is a picture of my playroom you can't bring in pictures into scratch junior but you can take pictures so if i want my own background i go to edit the background i click on the camera click in there and it lets me take a picture of my room and that's now the background in my project another way we can personalize is with our characters have you noticed you have a lot of characters with faces and then you have a whole nother group of characters that don't have faces do you know what that's for when you edit one of those and click on the camera and click on the face it lets you take a picture i'm not going to take a picture of me i have this little clown friend because he's such a funny guy and he likes to tell knock knock jokes you can also change the way these characters look i can change his shirt i'm using the paint bucket to just dump some different colors on him let's get another character we'll call him boy two and call the guy that likes to tell jokes boy one and put them in my playroom that is one of the main things that you're going to learn in today's lesson is how to change your background to a real picture and how to change a face on one of your characters to a real picture you can put your face here you could make yourself an astronaut click on the picture and then click where you want to take the picture and i took a picture of my spiderman that's how i make spiderman an astronaut but besides bringing in your own pictures today we're going to practice with the message blocks because a lot of the scenes and games and things that you're going to want to create your characters will need to communicate with each other today the characters have to communicate back and forth and the timing of that is very important so boy one is going to start when the green flag starts and he'll say knock knock and boy two will say who's there so how will boyd2 know when to say who's there do we do it with the green flag what happens they both say it at the same time that is not going to work you knew that so when boy one says knock knock then he'll send a letter to boy two he's gonna send an orange letter to boy two so boy two says when i get an orange letter i'll say who's there knock knock who's there okay so after he says who's there he's got to let boy one know all right it's your turn to talk again so we'll just pick the next color a red one so we'll go back to boy number one when you get a message you're opening it and so we're gonna open a red letter when he opens a red letter he knows it's his turn to continue with the joke so he says hatch and then he has to let boy 2 know he's done and it's his turn to talk so let's get another message block we're sending a message block so it's not open we'll send a yellow one this time boy two if he sees a yellow message he's gonna open it and say hatch who and then he has to let boy one know it's his turn to talk so he has to send a message we'll do a green one this time when boy one sees a green message he'll open it and say bless you it's good coding practice to always end your scripts and let's see if this worked knock knock who's there hatch hatch who bless you we're gonna do one more thing today that we haven't done before and that's record sounds if i go to this microphone you'll remember from previous lessons you can make a pop sound that's all that's in here but if i go to this microphone i can click this red and it's recording me right now and then i'll stop i can play it back click this red and it's recording me right now what i want to record is who's there who's there who's there and we'll put that there instead of him instead of having that written above his head now we need to record hatch who hat two hat two and we'll put that one down here and get rid of the text so let's record the audio for boy number one he has three things to say let's record bless you bless you bless you okay let's record knock knock knock knock and let's record hatch hatch and get rid of the written hatch all right let's see how it goes now who's there hatch that's who bless you i'm not sure i like that better you can't really tell who's talking i'm going to add all that code in so that we have the recorded and the written words who's there hatch hatch who bless you that's the end of this lesson now it's your turn create a new project and for the background use your camera to bring in your own picture for at least one of the characters bring in a picture for their face use your face on the character and somewhere in your script use the recording option and say something or make a sound if you can do all those personalizations for your story then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free kids coding lesson was provided by stem in games subscribe watch more lessons and keep practicing and soon you will be creating new worlds and games and making your ideas come to life i'll see you next time
