welcome scratchers today we're doing a quick tip about how to clone sprites many times in our games we need a lot of sprites and the best way to do that is with clones these are the three blocks that you'll need when creating a clone this starting block when i start as a clone all the code underneath that will tell your sprite what to do when he starts as a clone i'm on this yellow axolotl right now all this underneath here tells him what to do when he starts as a clone if i just click create clone of myself that will make this yellow axolotl create a clone of himself inside the code here it changes the color it's why it's blue and i can just click that as many times as i want inside my program the egg code says whenever i click the egg that's what creates the clone it's going to create a clone of whatever type i have selected let's start with something simpler so we just have some basic code to make this axolotl do something but instead of creating one when the green flag is clicked we want to do clones clones are under the control blocks and when i start as a clone i want to do all this just drag the code from when green flag clicked over to when i start as a clone and the way you start a clone is by creating a clone since the code is in with this purple axolotl it's going to be a clone of himself if we wanted it to be in another sprite we wouldn't have this egg axolotl egg create a clone of himself he's going to create a clone of the purple axolotl and there he created a clone i can click create another clone just create as many as i want when you get done with a clone you want to use the block delete this clone but in this case i'm not done with the axolotl so i'm not going to delete them we can just keep creating more let's look at some other examples in my full axolotl game you'll see that these axolotls have a lot of code when they start as a clone and the regular sprite stays hidden the whole time the clones are created in the code for the egg because when i click on the egg i want it to create a clone of the type of axolotl that you've selected in my pizza clicker game every time you click a tiny pizza clone flies out and that's in this code when i started a clone you can watch the full video for how to create this pizza clicker game but creating the clone is hidden in this dough code if the mouse is down it creates a clone of tiny pizza right here one more example is my breakout game all of these bricks are drawn by this one sprite they're all clones when he starts as a clone then he has all the code that he needs to be a clone when he gets hit by the ball he's going to disappear and delete this clone right here you'll see i have the code for delete the clone because once it gets hit by the ball it's not needed anymore even though there's not an infinite number of blocks that need to be created i still thought it was best to use clone for this so the way i did that six times because i'm going to need six rows i did a repeat loop and then 16 across so it creates a clone creates a clone creates a clone 16 times and then it goes to the next one does that 16 times goes to the next one and it does that six times so it's just a loop inside a loop and inside there it creates a clone of myself because there's so many blocks that need to be created in my tic tac toe game i could have used clones for this there's three across and three down so there's nine clones here of where the x's and o's can go and i've seen other programmers use clones to do that but i thought the best way to do that was to just have nine sprites so i didn't use clones to make the tictactoe game i hope you've enjoyed this quick tip give me a thumbs up and subscribe below whenever you have to create a lot of characters remember to use these three coding blocks to clone your sprite i'll see you next time bye bye
