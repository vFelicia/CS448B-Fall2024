welcome to coding with Neo this is the mbot 2 also known as the inbot Neo from make block you program it with block programming just like you do in scratch so if you know how to do scratch it'll be easy for you I'm going to skip all the how to connect and disconnect and upload and all that stuff today we're going to be programming in live we're just going to do some simple shapes so we're going to make him move around in some simple shapes and you have to get an extension called the inbot 2 shield so that you can control his Motors and let's start off doing a square so if we want to move forward and then turn left let's go forward 20 centimeters see if that's far enough and we need to do that four times to make a square and we'll just make him go let's see what happens yeah 20 centimeters was enough and just make him go around in a simple Square and of course 90 degrees makes a square let's do three turns at 120 and make a triangle and I'm just clicking on it to make it run just like in scratch you can have when the green flags clicked did it really make a triangle it's a little off there's a little slippage depending on your surfaces so sometimes you can't get the exact right shape or the exact same distance if you say 20 centimeters you might get 19 out of it besides just moving forward and turning left there's other controls you can move each wheel a certain speed let's just move forward a certain speed let's go back to doing a square all right so we'll move forward at 50 rpns RPMs revolutions per minute then we'll turn let's do a square let me get rid of all this okay so turn left 90. and we're going to do 50 RPMs four times we have a diamond going on here instead of a square close enough so what happens if we go 100 revolutions per minute see if he can handle 200 foreign to go here we go he's climbing up my lamp over there he's gone okay so let's not do it for a second let's do it for a third of a second popping wheelies what can we do next we need to make a circle how can we make a circle if we go forward and left and forward and left that's that's going to be too jerky that's not going to make a good Circle we need to play around with some of the other blocks what happens if we move the left wheel at 50 RPMs for one second so we're moving the left wheel which makes him turn right what happens if we move the right wheel for one second that is making him go backwards so it's the right wheel but the right wheel is rolling backwards so when we use the right wheel we need to do negative to get what would we would expect to make him turn left so if we have the left one and the right one that is not going to be going at the same time they're going to go after each other he's gonna zigzag if we want him to go at the same time we got to pick this one so we got the left wheel going forward and the right wheel going backwards that's going to get us forward it's going to make us lose him because that does not have a stop it doesn't say one second or for a distance or anything so we got a stop motor and go find him so if we wanted to make a circle all we would have to do is make the left one go less than the right one so I think that's pretty good for our first lesson we can make a square multiple ways we can make a triangle a circle remember to like And subscribe so you don't miss any of the lessons of coding with Neo I'll see you next time bye bye
