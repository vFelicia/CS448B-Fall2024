welcome to scratch coding with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today we're going to create something like this it's a breakout game you move the paddle and break all the bricks away breakout's been around since the 1970s but it's still fun my favorite part about playing this game is whenever i can get the ball past the top row and it just bounces around and gets all the bricks for me and this is what it would look like if you miss so let's start at the beginning and create a new project get rid of scratch cat and we need some bricks and this button will work just fine let's look at the costumes for this button we have just blue and gray i could just fill the whole thing in one color but i kind of like the shading so i'll do the the left color a lighter red and the right color a darker red and i'll duplicate that to make another color and rename the button to button one the next one i'll do orange just click on the outside get the select tool and click on the outside change the left color to a lighter orange and the right color to a darker orange and then click on the middle part and do the same thing a lighter orange on the left and a darker orange on the right and then duplicate that one so that we can make a yellow one and pick a light and dark yellow and do the same thing on the inside and i'll jump off a minute to make some more buttons i still have the blue but i added a green and a purple brick now let's see what code we need if we wanted our game to only have about six bricks across then we could leave him this size but i want it to have more so i'll make it about 30 percent let's see how big that is that's a good size to give us a bunch of bricks and i want him to start off as the first brick that'll be a red one and i want him to go to where he's at right now and the go to block is going to be the position the xy position of your brick right then and what i want him to do is to just keep drawing copies of himself all the way across and i'm not sure how many that's going to be just yet let's repeat 10 times and create a clone of himself and then he'll just move over so he'll create a clone of himself move over by 10 create a clone of himself move over by 10 create a clone of himself repeat that 10 times okay those are too close let's change our x by 30. we're going to have to stop it to get rid of the first ones and we need more of them how about 16 we need to make that original guy not be visible because we want to just see the clones so the original sprite is hidden but if he starts off as a clone we want him to be visible so we add a show for him and then we start the other code when the green flag is clicked i'm going to adjust the numbers a little to make them fit better that's good spacing so we've got 16 going across and then we want it to go to the next row and do 16 more across that's a different color and remember we have six different colors so we need this one to repeat six times inside this repeat six times first it's going to draw the first row then it's going to go to the next costume which will just get a different color brick we want it to move down on the yaxis it's going to be a negative but how much change y by let's just say negative 10. and our x to start off with was a negative 225 so we need to go back to there too so it drew them all but we just need to go negative y more we'll try 20 negative 20. let's try negative 18. i like that spacing all right wait hold stop everything this is what the program looks like after it's already done but i wanted to add this in here because i just figured something out right here where it says next costume and we spent all that time working on all these costumes we didn't even have to do that it takes a while to figure out what all these bricks do what all this code does but you don't have to do next costume and change to the next color there's change color effect that would do the same thing i got a couple of rows of green here so let me change color effect by 30 instead of 25. and it's going to draw all those things for me i didn't have to do that so this is what the program's going to look like when it's completely done but i wanted to jump in here and show you this before you wasted a lot of time drawing all the different colors because you don't really have to i don't like the white background we could draw a rectangle and color it in or we could just convert to a bitmap and color it in that way okay now let's get a ball yellow ball is fine when the flags clicked i want him to go i think 30 percent of work i want him to go to the middle and forever move and bounce let's make him start off pointing just a little to the right so his life will be a little bit more interesting we need a paddle but i can't really pick a sprite that we already have let's draw one so we'll draw a rectangle i want kind of a greenish and then i want three different little rectangles so i'll copy and paste so i have three areas here and i want them to be slightly different colors the reason i want him to have three different colors is because when he bounces in the middle i want it to make the ball go straight back up and if he bounces on each side i want it to go at an angle so that we'll have a little bit of control when we hit the ball that'll be more like the original game and if i group them together i can make sure they're in the center we'll drag him down here to where he goes and then my go to block will show the right place when the game starts he's going to go to the middle i need a set size block if you want your game to be harder make your paddle smaller and what we want him to do you could use your arrow keys but what i'm going to do is set the x value that's how far left or right it is set that to the mouse value so then it just follows my mouse i like that better than the arrows for this game let's go back to the code for the ball sure it bounces when it hits the edge but we want it to bounce when it hits the paddle or when it hits a brick so we need some ifs it's touching something what's my bricks called that's just called button let's call that bricks so now our sprite for the bricks is actually called bricks and if our ball is touching bricks then let's make him change directions we'll make him point in a different direction it'll be direction plus 170 so he'll almost completely change direction because if we did it plus 180 it would go in the complete opposite direction i need another if if he's touching the middle of my paddle i want him to bounce straight up point in direction it's going to be zero degrees right click and duplicate that if if he's touching let's suck up some of that left color if he's touching the left of the paddle then we'll make him go back that way and if he's touching the right of the paddle will make him go a little bit bounce to the right at 45 degrees that has to be in that forever loop that's looking pretty good but we still need more code so what happens when i miss nothing let's change the background to have a different color down here because then we'll be able to sense if the ball missed the paddle and hit that color we'll go to a gray color we'll just draw a rectangle let's get it way down so you can barely see it go back to the code for the ball and have another condition ball if you're touching that gray color i gotta pick the gray color then broadcast game over and then stop this forever loop all right it worked it stopped the game we could add the code so we could have three lives but let's just leave it at one for now let's go back to the code for the bricks i need a forever loop for the bricks that it just keeps checking to see if it's touching the ball because when it gets hit by the ball it needs to disappear we need an if inside the forever loop so forever if you're touching the ball then hide and delete yourself it works they're disappearing i wish i could get it to go above the top row and just start bouncing around oh and i love it when that happens they just start bouncing around and i just keep racking up the points speaking of points we don't have any points let's get a score we're going to make a variable and call it score when the game first starts score is zero and every time we break a brick we want to add one to the score i need to add another if statement here if the score is ever so much that it means he broke all the bricks then we need to say that he won he won the game you could go on to a new level or something but i'm just going to say that he won the game if he clears the screen one time i need to add the code if score is greater than a certain amount so if we've got 16 across and we've got six rows that's 96 so we're going to have 96 bricks so if the score is greater than 95 that means he won i need to broadcast that he won i'll just say win message if i leave it like this there's going to be a brick left at the end i want him to hide before we say he won or that last brick will still be there instead of starting with the green flag let's add a start button and i'll just write the word start on a button that they already have next we're going to need a sprite to show whenever they win the game and another sprite to show whenever they lose the game so i'll create some text and say game over i want to make that red and then put some yellow highlight on it that looks good i need to right click that sprite and make a copy duplicate it and make that say winner so the winner sprite the code for that when the green flag is clicked he'll hide but when he receives the message win message then he'll show the game over message is just the opposite i'm going to drag the code over from from the winning message so when the green flag is clicked he's going to hide but whenever he receives the message that the game's over then he'll show so the game over message works we've got to get the start button working so this ball doesn't need to move until we click start when the green flag is clicked the start button needs to show and when the start button is clicked he needs to broadcast the message start pressed and then he needs to hide and just get out of the way now we've got to tell the ball to wait for the start press so this whole forever loop needs to be when the start's pressed when space no when i receive start press that's it and whenever the game is won when he receives the message win message the ball needs to stop bouncing around so stop all the other scripts in this sprite so the ball is just waiting on us now what do you think of the speed and hitting the middle of the paddle makes it go straight up that's good if i hit the left it goes left it's perfect we could add some code to where at the beginning of the game you could say how hard you want the game to be and make the paddle bigger or smaller or make the ball go faster or slower depending on how hard the player wanted the game to be let's give it a sound for when the ball hits the brick it's going to be in here whenever it's touching the ball and the brick disappears let's make it make a sound if we go to our sounds that's all we have we have to add a new sound i'm going to grab this boop bang thing i want to grab just one of these sounds and once i have what i want i just copy it to a new sound and that's the sound that i want and i'll rename that sound just bop let's see what it sounds like if we do that every time we hit a brick what we need is to play the sound bop in that if loop if it's touching the ball but we need to hide it before we play the sound it's hard to get these blocks exactly where you want them all right i got my sound turned on i wanted you to be able to hear that sound that i added it really adds to the game leave a comment below if you'd like to see anything else added to this game or if you've done a breakout game give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel so you won't miss any of the other games that i do and it'll make it easier for people to find them
