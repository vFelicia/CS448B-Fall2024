welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today we're going to make a character jump like this you already know to make a character go up you increase y see how it's changing here and to make it go down you decrease y so one might think that the code to make y go to 120 and then to make y go to minus 120 would make it jump let's see i'm going to press 1 on my keyboard so that changed y to where he was up at the 120 position and then he went back down to the minus 120 position that does not look like a real jump let's try making him glide when i press two he's gonna glide up for .7 seconds he'll glide up to the y position six and then he'll glide back down to the y position minus 114. let's see what that looks like that's better than this one but it still doesn't look like a real jump let's try when i press 3 on my keyboard we're going to do a loop this loop he'll go up by 8 15 times and then this loop he'll go down by 8 15 times let's see what that looks like that looks a lot like the glide doesn't it before we look at option four let's think more about what happens when you jump up or if you throw a ball up if you throw a ball up it's going really fast in the beginning and then as it goes up it slows down and slows down and slows down gravity is making it slow down until it stops and then it comes back down it starts off going slow but then gravity makes it speed up speed up speed up until it comes back down so if we want to make a character jump and scratch we need to make the character start off fast when he jumps and then slow down till he stops and then as he falls back down he increases his speed so let's go back to scratch to see how to code that and that's what i've coded here for when i press key 4 he starts off going faster he slows down until he stops and then he falls back down getting faster and faster as he falls down the speed that he's going i have a variable called y change and that shows you how fast he's going watch whenever i press it and he jumps up y change is going to go from 15 all the way down to 1 and then back up to a minus 15. so we're just going to start off anywhere on the screen it doesn't matter and i set my variable to 15 and then in this loop it repeats 15 times it makes him go up 15 and then it changes my speed or y change to 14. then he goes up by 14 and it changes my y by 14 then 13 and it just keeps going in the loop until my y change or my speed is down to one then i have a loop to bring him back down in this loop we change y change by a negative one every time and then you change his y position by that amount he'll be going down minus one and then minus two minus three it just keeps repeating let's redo this code for another character let's make nano jump i could use y change but let's make a new variable because when you're doing this in your code you're going to have to start from the beginning let's call the variable speed so here's my variable speed we already know we're going to have to have a loop for him to go up and another loop for him to come down in my other code i used 15 but it can be different that's not the important part let's just make it 20. as long as you also come back down 20. and you know on the way up you're going to be changing your y position and on the way back down you'll be changing your y position but instead of changing by 10 we want to change by speed normally i would start my code whenever the green flag is clicked or something else like that happens but i have a lot of other code running and so let's change it to when i press the up arrow it'll start my code let's make speed 20. since we're going to loop 20 times and in the loop we need to slow him down on the way up and then make him go faster coming back down notice that these are both negative if you start off with speed being 20 and you take away from it speed is going to get smaller and smaller as he goes up until it gets to zero so it'll go from 20 to zero on the way back down it's going to go from zero to minus 20. so you're still changing your speed by a minus one each time let's see how that looks he's not quite going all the way back down we need to change the y after we've taken one away let's try it now that's it that's a pretty good jump sometimes it's helpful to have this loop where he's going up to be separate from the loop that's coming down but really if this is repeated for 15 and this one is repeated for 15 and what we're doing inside there is changing y and subtracting 1 from our y change or from our speed we could just loop 30 times and get rid of this second loop the only thing we'll have to change y one more time after the loop and it'll end up being the same thing just makes it a little shorter that's the end of this lesson click like and subscribe below so i can keep making tutorials and more people can find them now it's your turn get a character and make them jump and make their speed change on the way up and down so it'll look realistic if you can make your character jump and change their speed then congratulations you've finished
