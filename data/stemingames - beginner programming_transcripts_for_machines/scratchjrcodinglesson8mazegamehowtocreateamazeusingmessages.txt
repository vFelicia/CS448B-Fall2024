welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write you will need the scratch junior app on your ipad android tablet or computer scratch junior is a free download and you'll have to get it so that you can do coding with us today you're going to create something like this it's a maze game to make the frog move through the maze i have to click on the arrows and if he hits a wall he just goes back and has to start over but if he can maneuver through all the corners and not touch the wall then he'll make it to the finish you won this maze game is lesson number eight you'll be using a lot of things that you've already learned and there'll be some new things so if this goes too fast for you then you might want to go back and watch the first seven lessons or maybe watch this video a couple times one thing that's new is i have two different screens i have one that's got the maze on it and then once he wins the game then it goes to this one that says you won that's two different scenes and on this scene i have all this confetti falling down and the words you won and on the first scene i have our little frog and the maze and then the finish line is a different character and then all of these different arrows are different characters whenever you click on one of the arrow characters it makes the frog move in that direction like i said this game is more complicated than what we've worked on so far but it really is a lot of fun are you ready to create your own maze click on the plus icon to start a new project and remove the default character and like we did before when we learned how to use the editor we're going to click here on the paintbrush and we have to make a maze what i did with the other one is draw a bunch of rectangles and fill them in and just turned them in all the different directions that i needed but that surely takes a lot more time i like the way it turned out though but what would be even easier is if i picked the line tool and picked a really thick line and just drew a maze we'll go this way that way and to fill the whole screen we have to select it and pick the way it looks blocks and make it look bigger we need another character to go through the maze i had the frog before i think i'll pick him again i like him and i have the frog selected and he's too big he'd be bumping into the walls for sure so let's make him smaller this can be his starting place we have to make the finish line i like green for that just to start out we're going to just put the finish line right here to make it really simple we need one more for now and that's going to be our right arrow but i'll show you how i drew that i made a triangle and let's turn it to the right and move it over fill it with some blue and i made a rectangle if you wanted to you could just as easily pick the line tool and just draw an arrow that works just as good so my arrow is too big i have to pick the blue arrow and then i can make it smaller now what i want is when i click the blue arrow i want the frog to move to the right so we've seen some of these blocks that cause things to happen if you tap on something you can make it do things if something runs into something you can make it do things if you hit the green flag you can make it do things but how can the blue flag say hey i've been touched frog you move right how can he send a message to the frog and tell him to move right what he can do is put it in this envelope he's going to send a message in the envelope to the frog and tell the frog to go right so just to help me remember right i'm going to do red red for right they both start with r so this is the right arrow when it's touched it's going to send a red letter it really doesn't even know where it's in the letter it just knows that if it's touched it's going to send a red letter let's go to the code for the frog so frog if you see somebody has sent out a red letter i want you to open that and then go right let's see if that works and every time i touch the blue arrow the frog goes right now nothing happens when he hits the finish line or hits the walls of the maze we haven't written the code for that but really the new part that you're learning for this lesson is going to be sending a message from this blue arrow to the frog will tell the green finish line when somebody runs into you then i want you to say you won let's see what that looks like so the finish line is going to tell the frog that he won so let's edit the finish line and tell it to spin around and then let's move it over here because we've got to get our frog all the way over here to the other side of the maze so the code for the blue arrow to the right is send a red message we've got to do that three more times for up down and left in a previous lesson you learned how to copy characters let's do that again we're going to copy this character by dragging it over here to our scene and we're going to copy that blue flag again by dragging it into our scene and one more time to make four of them so now we have four arrows we need to edit this one and make it point up edit this one to go left and edit this one to point down so we have right up left down all sending a red message we have to do something different every time and i need to make every one of them smaller so right is red for up let's see it ends with so let's do purple for left let's do yellow for down let's do green i think we can remember all my codes so let's tell the frog to receive all these messages so red is right there's four different directions we're going to have to figure out we got right left up and down okay left was with the l it's yellow up is purple down is green better remember that right down left we didn't tell him to start over when he hits a wall up right down so all our arrows are working that's good we got to tell him when he hits the wall hey dude you got to start over so we need another code for the frog we have him picked we're going to tell him when you run into something you're going to have to just start over let's see how that works right's working if he goes down and runs into the wall makes him start over if he keeps hitting the wall he has to keep starting over goes right down go froggy you can do it run froggy down froggy finish line yay you won go froggy have you been making any new games do you wait and watch my videos are you coming up with stuff on your own you have learned so much and done so much you could start making some stories and games all on your own that's the end of this lesson now it's your turn create a project and get a character make a maze and make your character move using arrows that you create if you're one of my younger students it is perfectly fine for you to have the finish line right over here and just program one arrow and make your character finish the finish line just right by going over to the right if you can create a maze and make your character move through the maze by tapping on arrows then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free kids coding lesson was provided by stem and games subscribe watch more lessons and keep practicing and soon you will be creating new worlds and games and making your ideas come to life i'll see you next time
