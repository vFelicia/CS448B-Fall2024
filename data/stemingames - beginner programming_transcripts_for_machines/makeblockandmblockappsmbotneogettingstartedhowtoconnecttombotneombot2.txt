welcome to mbot neocoding join us as we have fun and learn to code our inbot Neo robot are you having trouble connecting to Neo what do I do let's talk about that it's easy to build him and he comes with some programs it's easy to just go through they're fun to play with and there's so many options to do after that that it can get confusing so let's talk about it if you're going to use a phone then you want to get the make block app if you have an iPad you want to get the make block app and also the M Block app the make block app is going to let you play around with Neo as if he's a remote control car but the inblock app is going to let you also code this is the make block app within this app you can drive around like embot Neo is a remote control car you can draw a path and he'll follow that path or you can play it like a piano the first thing it's going to want you to do is connecting through Bluetooth and as long as it's close it'll connect right up so you can use this to control him you can draw a path and then tell him to follow it and it's very obedient and that sound is coming from him not from the iPad if you go to code within the make block app it's going to take you to the M Block app and within the M Block app you're going to have to connect again and if you just hold it close the iPad's really good about the Bluetooth connection and from there you can write code just as if you were on a PC now let's talk about connecting with a PC because that's what I would prefer to use when I'm coding if I try to connect here even when I go to Bluetooth it never finds it it says I have to have Bluetooth 4.0 and I do so I ended up buying this little Bluetooth dongle and it works great never have any trouble connecting with that it comes with instructions that you have to press this little button to make it pair with your inbot Neo but it comes with this USB cable let's talk about using that of course you have to use that to charge him but you can also let's just pretend this is my computer because this is plugged into my computer but you can also connect to him not just charging but you can connect to him with this cable so if you have him connected to your computer instead of Bluetooth you would use USB and it's going to default to the right one and then you would just connect and so now I'm connected and I'm going to be live or in upload mode just like I would be on the iPad if I don't want to use the cable which I don't whenever I'm coding I want to be able to code him and let him do the code live without having him tie it down to the computer so I would prefer to use this USB stick it cost me 15 bucks well worth it so when you have that Bluetooth connected that Bluetooth dongle connected you hit connect and it looks just like you don't pick Bluetooth over here you pick USB because the computer thinks you are connected through USB and somehow their Bluetooth connects but my computer would not connect the only other major issue I've had is whenever I was first starting to do this and I went to add there used to be an inbot Neo in here and so I added in by Neo and I tried to code him and tried to make different blocks work if things wouldn't work it was broken he's gone now so I guess they figured out people were using it when they weren't supposed to for inbox Neo we're supposed to use cyberpie cyberpie is as you know this little control board up here so make sure you pick the cyberpie for your device and this M Block that I have on my computer you can run that online or you can install it I'll have it installed but choosing the right device and getting the Bluetooth working on my computer is the only real trouble that I've had now that we're connected it's time to start coding like And subscribe so you don't miss any of the coding videos I'll see you next time bye bye foreign
