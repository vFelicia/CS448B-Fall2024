welcome to scratch coding with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today we're going to make a pizza clicker game every time you click it makes a new pizza when you have at least 50 pizzas you'll be able to buy some sauce and when you buy the sauce then every time you click you'll get two pizzas for every click so it'll be even faster before you'll be able to buy some more sauce and you just keep clicking this is why it's called a clicker game because you just click and just keep buying enough sauce so that every time you click you're getting five now i'm getting eight every time i click and when you can afford it you can buy some cheese once you buy the cheese you'll be getting one pizza every second pps is pizzas per second even without clicking you get a pizza every second then when you can afford it you can add some peppers to your pizza and that's going to give me 10 more pizzas for every click it cost me 500 pizzas though i'll get some more peppers so now every time i click i'm getting 54 pizzas when you're ready and you can afford it you could put some olives on the pizza it'll cost you 2 000 pizzas but then you're getting a thousand more pizzas per second definitely a good investment it's surprising how fun a clicker game is load it up with some olives so that you'll be getting 30 000 pizzas per second then you can afford some tomatoes which will end up getting you a thousand more pizzas per click and when you have at least a a million pizzas saved up then you could buy some pepperoni i want some more peppers just for decoration i need to be able to afford some more pepperoni and that's how we play our pizza clicker game let's see how to write the code i hope you learned something helpful and enjoy watching give me a thumbs up and subscribe below we're going to start off today with the pizza clicker resources this is just the sprites there's a link to this below in the video description the resources includes all the drawings that we need all the sprites that we need to create this game of course if you want to draw your own olives or if you want to draw sausage or anything else you can do that but this will just save us some time the first thing i want to do is get a background i'll select upload backdrop and pick this tablecloth and earlier i found this tablecloth picture on the internet i'll convert it to vector and resize it and that'll be my background i don't need this one anymore i'm going to put a lot of the code that we need in the code for the dough you'll see i've provided a picture of the dough but there's no code yet first let's make it show on the screen that's probably a pretty good size when the green flag is clicked let's make sure that it shows that's probably a good spot for it too in case we accidentally drag it around somewhere let's make it go back to that same spot when we start the game in my original game whenever we clicked it made the dough grow and shrink so let's let's put that effect on it forever it's going to check and if the mouse is down it's going to change the dose size so mouse down is sensing if it senses that the mouse is down it's going to change the size by 5 and then it'll change the back the size back down to the same as it was before but that will happen too fast so we need a little bit of time in between there not a whole second let's wait point one of a second that works now we want to be able to to get some points some money some pizzas i like to call it pizzas we want to get pizzas every time we click so we're going to need a variable make a variable and call it pizzas and if the mouse is down we're going to change pizzas by 1. but if they hold the mouse down they keep getting points so we can't let them cheat like that after the mouse is down then this loop needs to wait until the mouse is not down so now if i hold the mouse down it doesn't give them extra points they have to actually click every time they want to point i have another sprite down here called tiny pizza i used this picture of a pizza to make a pizza fly out every time you click a pizza flies out so that's what we use tiny pizza for so we're not gonna actually show tiny pizza we're going to show a clone of tiny pizza we go back to the code for the dough every time they click the mouse we're going to create a clone of tiny pizza let's go to the code for tiny pizza let's see what it looks like there he is so what's a good size for him was 15 good that's a good size for tiny pizza so when the green flag is clicked we're going to set his size to 15 and we're gonna make sure that he's hidden but if he's a clone if he starts as a clone then we want him to show but we don't want him to be really bright like this and to make him kind of faded out we're going to use the ghost effect so it's just going to be faded out about 40 percent we want him to start off in the middle of the screen that'll be zero zero for our x and y and we want him to just fly out across the screen so to do that we're going to make him move so just move 10 steps at a time we've got to get that to repeat a bunch of times so more than 10 let's make that 30. and he'll just fly across the screen we don't want him to go in the same direction every time let's make him point in a random direction when he first starts off and if it's any direction all the way around just a random number that's going to be between 1 and 360. so that time he went up that time he went he's going every different direction starting from the middle that's working pretty good we'll have some pizzas accumulating on the side though so we need to get rid of those so as he's moving across the screen moving 10 steps at a time when he gets to the edge i want him to get deleted so we have to get him to if touching the edge touching is going to be sensing because he'll sense that he's touching the edge he's just going to delete himself so we have to pick delete this clone now they disappear when they get to the edge and our pizzas are accumulating up there it's all working good so far let's go back to the code for our dough even when we hit the green flag it doesn't reset our pizzas we want our pizza variable to start off at zero when we start the game so go to our variables when the green flag is clicked we want to set pizzas to 0. we need a couple more variables i want to have ppc which stands for pizzas per click and pps which stands for pizzas per second pizzas per second is going to be zero when it starts and pizzas per click will be one when it starts so they're not getting any pizzas every second when they start but they do get a pizza every click and every time we click right now pizzas per click is one and this is one so it doesn't matter but when pizzas per click is more than one we're going to want to get that many every time we click ok so it still works if we change pizzas per click to 10 then we would get 10 pizzas every click if we change pizzas per second to a thousand nothing happens because we didn't write the code for that yet we need every second to increase the pizzas by pizzas per second that whole process is going to start when the green flag clicks we need it in a forever loop and what we want to do is change our number of pizzas by however many pizzas per second we're supposed to be earning but we can't just run that it's way too fast we're going to make it wait for a second in between there so now we're getting a thousand pizzas every second all right that looks good let's change pizzas per click back to one and pizzas per second back to zero that's the way the game is going to start and let's give our players some stuff to buy the first thing we're going to want them to be able to put on the pizza is the sauce this isn't actually the sauce this is just a little picture that goes up here that lets them buy some sauce and the way i created this was the little graphic image here with a outline and then just three different lines of text you can do text just by clicking on the text and typing you can change the size of it just by dragging it bigger or smaller you could change these prices if you want so the code for the sauce first off i need to make it show up and that actually might be a good place for it when the green flag is clicked i'll tell it to go right there and if somebody clicks that sprite they're going to want to buy some sauce to put on the pizza but if they don't have at least 50 to spend then they can't buy it so we need to check we need an if then get an operator and look at our variable pizzas if pizzas is greater than 50 then they can afford it and we're going to let the other sauce know that it needs to show up we're going to do that by broadcasting the message show sauce and so when they show the sauce then it cost them 50 pizzas so i have to change that variable change it by minus 50 which means we're just subtracting 50 and what booster did they buy when they bought the sauce then they get an extra point per click so we need to change that we need to change points per click by one it's just going to increase it by one so when the green flag is clicked you get credit for the clicks but you don't actually get to buy any sauce until we have 50. once we were able to buy the sauce then we're getting two points per click it's working perfect now we got to make the sauce show up i have another picture down here for you if you get this out of the resources that's the pizza sauce and remember in here we broadcasted show sauce so in this pizza sauce receives the message show sauce then it's gonna show how easy is that we need to make sure it shows up in the right place though it's back behind there so not only in the right place but also on top let's go back to the code for the pizza sauce when the green flag is clicked he's going to hide but he's also going to go to the front so when you show him you'll be able to see him he'll be in front of the dough i'm going to hit the green flag so my dough will go back to where it's supposed to be i'm going to show my sauce and that's in a good spot so in my motion i'll make him go to that xy position when the game starts so he'll be hidden but it'll be in the right place and that's all the code i need for my sauce if they end up buying more sauce it's just going to show another one right on top we're gonna do the exact same thing for the cheese we have a picture of the cheese right here in the costumes that has the words next to it that says how much it costs and that that's gonna increase your pizzas per second by one that code is going to be a lot like the sauce code so we'll just copy it i'm going to drag this to my cheese sprite and drag this one now i'll go to my cheese and let me make him show so instead of going to minus 207 100 let's make him go to 209 444 and he costs a hundred so if somebody wants to buy this we got to make sure they have at least a hundred already and we're going to broadcast show cheese we're going to take away 100 from them and we'll change pizzas per second by one that's it for the cheese let's go to the actual cheese that goes on the pizza we have no code but it's going to be really similar to the pizza sauce so let's copy that when he receives the message show cheese he's going to show and when the green flag is clicked he's going to hide he's going to go to the front layer and he's going to go to the right spot so for the sauce and the cheese it doesn't matter how many you have on there it's still going to look exactly the same but when you start buying tomatoes and olives and peppers that is a clone because you don't know how many peppers you're going to need or how many pepperonis you're going to need and so i made all of those clones let's look at peppers next let's make that show and let's also look at the costumes this first costume this is the one that shows up up here and peppers2 the second costume is the one that shows up on the pizza there's not two different sprites for it there's just two different costumes so the code for it when the game first starts let's make sure the size is right we'll change it to 35 and go to where he is right now and set his costume to the first costume now this next part is similar to what we did for the sauce and the cheese we need to find out if they have enough money to buy it so if they try to buy it they click on it when this sprite is clicked we need to see if they have enough money it's going to be pizzas we need an operator if pizzas is greater than and the peppers are costing them 500. so we've got to make sure they have at least 500 and if they do it's going to go in here and run this code so if they do have enough money we're going to take away 500 change pizzas by negative 500 we're going to give them 10 more pizzas per click so we'll change pizzas per click by 10 and we need to create a clone of the peppers with that second costume for this we're just going to create a clone of myself and then the code that's going to run for that clone is when i start as a clone i need to be peppers 2. this costume we don't want it to show up behind the cheese so we'll tell it to go to the front layer i don't have enough money i'm going to set just for testing here i'm going to set pizzas higher so i can buy some peppers okay so i bought some peppers but it looks like it's showing my peppers right here so that's not good so when he starts as a clone he needs to show up over here somewhere on the pizza let's have it from about 0 to 180 for the x and minus 100 to 100 for the y so we got to tell it to go to a random position somewhere on this doe or it's going to be on the cheese really when he starts at a as a clone he's going to go to a random x y position we'll start with the x between 0 and 180 and the y between negative 100 and positive 100 so if we put on some sauce and then we put on some cheese and we put some peppers oh that one's that one's way off we can make y smaller let's change it to 80. that's a lot better they're still a little messy but that's close enough are we getting 10 more pizzas per click every time we got 482 492. everything's working perfect now the next thing we have is the olives are we done with this code we want to make sure we have it right before we start copying it somewhere else we'll have to change things in multiple places i think it looks good so we've got to copy all three of these to our olives go to the code for the olives when he starts as a clone he's going to change his costume to olives 2 go to the front layer that random position should be pretty close we need to show him as olives i think maybe 30 would be better make sure he starts off in the right place and then whenever somebody tries to buy him they have to have at least two thousand and it's gonna cost them two thousand but then their pizzas per second goes up by a thousand and they create a clone of themself and the clone is gonna show up over there so we gotta go back to the peppers and get us some money oh that's too big we'll make them a lot smaller that's a lot smaller let's get some money some sauce and some cheese and that looks good yeah we just need to add a couple more things do the same thing for the tomatoes and the pepperoni you can create as many ingredients as you want and just copy that same code to all the ingredients in each ingredient you just have to put it in the right place charge the right amount of pizzas and then increase the pizzas per click or the pizzas per second you can change the sprites to be anything that you want you could change the picture to be sausage instead of tomato you can change the words and the cost or anything you want just change the code to match whatever you say you're charging and that's how you create a pizza clicker game now we have sausage and pepperoni we can make a meat lover's pizza share the clicker game that you create in my studio the link is below give me a thumbs up and subscribe it'll really help me out this free coding
