welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today you'll be creating a maze game you'll be able to navigate your character through the maze using your arrow keys before we create the maze i just want to show you that i added these arrows on my screen just so you can tell when i press my up arrow or right or down or left you do not need these you do not need the code see all the code that it takes to do that you won't need that but you will need a background to create a new background we could try to choose one but none of these will really work well for a maze so let's draw our own when you look at the backdrops this one that looks like stars will just give you a random backdrop you don't know what it is if you took a picture or got a picture from somewhere you could bring that picture in using the upload backdrop but to draw your own we go to paint i'm going to make it a little smaller so i can see the whole thing and you could get the paint brush and just draw on here something that you needed to go around but i'm going to just draw some rectangles i don't want a black outline i just want to fill my rectangles in with let's go with a green color so this is the edge i'll make my character come in over here and go out over there so i'm going to close in the whole rest of it put something in the way you can make this as complicated as you want but that's not really necessary i'm going to start off on a red color and end on a blue color the only important part about drawing your maze is that your walls are a different color than your finish line now let's pick a character let's make the crab smaller so he'll fit through the maze and he doesn't have any code so you'll see when i hit the arrows it doesn't make him do anything so when i hit the right arrow i want him to move right pushing the right arrow is an event so i can change when space key is pressed i can change that to when right arrow is pressed so when the right arrow is pressed i want to change his x location let's see what 10 does let's see if that's too much that's not too much i need an event for all four keys let me pull three more over when left arrow is pressed i want to change the x by a negative 10. instead of 10 to the right it'll go 10 to the left when down arrow is pressed i want to change y by a negative 10. and when up is pressed i want to change y by a positive 10. we'll see how that looks yeah he made it through the maze when you're creating your game think about what you want it to do what you want it to say and add as much code as you want i want mine to say i won when he touches something blue when he touches that finish line so touching blue you would think would be an event but it's not the crab is gonna sense that he's touching blue so let me look in sensing when touching a certain color and to change the color to blue click on the color and then get this little dropper and then you just suck up some blue paint and it changes it to when touching the color blue but we have to get the code to find out if he's touching the color blue so if he's touching the color blue i want him to say i win how do we get that code to run because right now he's not touching the color blue if i run the code it'll just check one time and that's it so i've got to get it to continually keep checking for if he's touching the color blue we'll put that in a forever loop we have to have the if inside the forever so when the green flag is clicked it's going to continuously check to see if he's touching blue and if he is he's going to say he wins it worked now another thing i wanted to do if he touches the wall i want him to have to start over so where is he when he's right there he's at 169 106. so at the beginning of the game i want him to go to that starting spot and i also want him to do that if he touches the color green let me get another if if he senses he's touching the color green let me suck up some green paint if he senses that he's touching the color green he's going to go back to that spot it was not updating my blocks when i dragged to the beginning this 169 106 was not the right location but now my starting position is really 181 negative 181 113 so when i first hit the green flag i wanted to go to this beginning spot or if he touches the green wall i want him to go to this beginning spot it works so if he goes down and over oh almost touch the green and he makes it to the blue he says i win i'm going to add another sprite and pick tatiana because we're looking at her from above i'm going to go to my crab and copy all the code from the crab to tatiana just by dragging it and letting it go now when i go to tatiana all my code's jumbled up but it's all here let's make her smaller i'm going to go to the crab and just hide it right there it's got show and this will hide it i want to focus on tatiana right now if i want to make tatiana move to the right i hit the right key and down right up and she'll say i win but since we can see her from above i want to make her turn so when i hit the right key instead of her going right i want her to turn to the right this is a completely different way of using the keys to play this game when i hit the up arrow i want her to go forward so i'm not going to change y actually let's just get rid of change y change at y change x change x we're not going to change x or y when you push up you want her to go forward whichever direction she's pointing so she'll move 10 steps when she goes down she'll move a minus 10 steps it's just a different way of moving your character it's your game you're writing the program you can do it any way you want when i press the left arrow tatiana is going to turn left when i press the right she'll turn right let's see how that goes i win now it's your turn if you can create a character that goes through your maze using the arrow keys then congratulations
