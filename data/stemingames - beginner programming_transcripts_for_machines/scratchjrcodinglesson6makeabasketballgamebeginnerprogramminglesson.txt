welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write you will need the scratch junior app on your ipad android tablet or computer scratch junior is a free download and you'll have to get it so that you can do coding with us today you're going to create something like this she's going to dribble the basketball and then make a score click on the plus icon to start a new project hold down on the default character until the x pops up and then delete it click on the landscape up here to bring up the background gallery and we want the basketball court and we need a character to dribble the basketball so we'll hit the plus over here to get a new character and out of all the people here i thought she looked like she was dribbling a basketball so i picked her we're also going to need a basketball so i'll go ahead and get that character so when i select my teen this is the coding area all the instructions for her will be here when i select the basketball this is the coding area for the basketball and all the instructions for the basketball will be here for the teen she's gonna go almost to the goal and then stop so she has to move to the right i'll just say 11 times so i'll put 11 right there and it'll tell it to go right 11 times reset her here and that works out good so i'm going to tell it to go right 11 times when i hit the green flag and that works good and then she'll just stop there's another way to do this exact same thing to make her go right 11 times and that's using this loop this repeat block if i tell her to go right one time and i repeat that 11 times then it does the same thing it doesn't matter we can do it this way or this way since we're learning something new today we'll just have it do our new way with our loop so put her back at the beginning and now we have to write the code for the basketball we want to make it start going right whenever there's a green flag we'll go right one time and repeat that 11 times see how that looks the ball needs to bounce up and down like it's being dribbled what if i put up and down inside our loop so it goes to the right and then it goes up and down then it goes to the right and then it goes up and down we need we need it to go up and down the same time that it's going to the right so let's add some more code so when the green flag is hit at the same time as it's going to the right it'll start going up and down and we're going to have to repeat that let's just leave it at four and see what happens so let's maybe repeat the bounces three times and see what happens so three was about right now let's make the basketball let's let her shoot a goal so after she gets to here it needs to go up and then over and then back down sew up and then over and then back down let's see if those numbers are about right it's a little bit too far right let's just make that a one and whenever it goes back down let's make it go back down a lot more than that when it leaves her hand it just seems to be going too slow that's a good speed for her to be dribbling it but i want it to go faster once she shoots the ball so our speed block is right here we want the speed to stay medium in the beginning but then right before she shoots it it's going to speed up let's see what that looks like that's pretty close put an ending block let's name this project up here at the top it's going to automatically say project and whatever the next number is let's call it basketball and where all our projects are you'll see it has a name somehow i ended up with this empty project so project 8 if i hold down on it i can click the x to delete it that's the end of this lesson now it's your turn create a new project and add the basketball court right here at the backgrounds and add a couple of characters one of the people and a ball and make the ball bounce up and down across the court and have the character dribble in the ball the main thing that you need to learn from this lesson is using this repeat block this loop instead of just having the character move 11 times to the right make them loop 11 times to go to the right and with this dribble if i try to put 11 right there it just makes it go up and down 11. it doesn't make it repeat 11 times so you have to have that repeat block so use this loop this repeat block if you can use the repeat block to make the ball dribble then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free kids coding lesson was provided by stem in games subscribe watch more lessons and keep practicing and soon you will be creating new worlds and games and making your ideas come to life i'll see you next time
