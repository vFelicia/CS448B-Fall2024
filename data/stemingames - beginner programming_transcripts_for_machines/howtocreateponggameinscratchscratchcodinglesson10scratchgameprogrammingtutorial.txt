welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today we're doing a simple version of pong it's like tennis or ping pong like and subscribe below because i have some power up ideas and some tricks that i want to share but today we're going to just keep it simple we have a new project first we have to make a backdrop we're going to paint one and i'm going to fill my background with blue and then i want just a little bit of a different blue on each side not real noticeable just a little different and then i want a white line down the middle to just show where the halfway point is and that's it for the background let's get rid of scratch and get a couple paddles for our game the paddle starts off turned 90 degrees and we want it to point zero how far left it is is minus 229 that's x i want y to be zero so it'll be right in the middle if you don't like the green it's easy to just come in here and change to whatever you want besides going to this starting position really the only thing the paddle needs to do is go up and down the paddle on the right is going to use the up and down arrows the paddle on the left is going to use w and s w to go up so when w is pressed we want to go up it's not x change y by 10. we can copy that and when s is pressed we're going to change y by a negative 10 to make it go down works perfect that's all the code we're going to need so i'm going to duplicate that paddle the first one i want to call it left paddle and that one i want to call it right paddle and right paddle i want it to start off way over here so instead of going to x negative 229 he'll be a positive 229 but he also needs to start in the middle at zero when the up arrow is pressed he'll go up and when the down arrow is pressed he'll go down and then two people can play against each other all we need now is a ball and of course you can go in here and change the color if you want we want to start all the code for the ball whenever the green flag is clicked and the first thing we want it to do is start moving forever and if it hits an edge to bounce off but instead of bouncing just straight back and forth we want to change this direction a little bit let's go with 95. also in the beginning we want it to just start right in the middle all right so it bounces off the walls just fine now now we need it to bounce off the paddles if it's touching the left paddle then go back to the right that's going to make it just go straight back it's going to be kind of boring you can play around with these numbers but what i like to do is take whatever direction it's going now and add something to it then it's not random but at least it's different every time it's not the same thing every time and then if it's touching the right paddle then it's a little different than the left paddle now we need to add if it's touching this blue line on the left it gives a point to the player on the right and if it's touching this blue line on the right it gives a point to the player on the left so we need a couple variables left score and right score this is his score and i can change it to a large readout to get rid of the word right score i don't need that and then we want to increase the score every time it touches that outside line that means we missed it with the paddle if it's touching this color over here i'm going to increase right score get some of that color and copy that would be the easiest thing and then if it's touching this blue over here we increase left score whenever we start the game we need to zero out these variables too so whenever the green flag is clicked we'll set both of them to zero it's looping through this so fast that it's touching the color a couple of times before the ball has a chance to turn around so it's adding more than one point whenever the ball hits the wall so if it's touching that color i could either wait for a certain amount of time or i could wait until it's not touching the color before i let it add another point so if it's touching that color then it's going to add a point and then wait until it's not touching the color before it moves on same with the other side but you never want to have a weight inside your forever loop mixed in with other code that needs to be running all the time so we've got to get another green flag and a forever loop and then these things can wait and it won't affect our other forever loop and that's all you need for a simple game upon this free coding lesson was provided by stem in games watch more lessons and keep practicing so you can create new worlds and games and make your ideas come to life i'll see you next time bye
