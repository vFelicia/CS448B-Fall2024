welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today we're going to create a jumping game that stores the score up at the top every time we jump over an obstacle we saw in the last video that there's lots of different ways to make a character jump one of the easiest ways is just to make the character glide up and back down another way is to use a variable so as the character goes up they slow down and as they come back down they speed up like this i like that way better so that's what i'm going to put in my game let's go see how to code a jumping game i'm going to start a new project and pick a stage let's keep scratch and get another sprite i'm going to make this banana sprite change into a strawberry and then change into a taco i'm going to go to my strawberry sprite my strawberry character go into his costumes and drag this costume over to my bananas and let it go then i'm going to go to my taco sprite and drag this taco over to my bananas and then you'll see when i go to bananas i have bananas and a strawberry and a taco so i don't need these other ones anymore i just think it would be funny if scratch was jumping over some fruit so that's what i'm gonna make my game do we'll have this crazy monkey throwing fruit at him we don't want the fruit to be too big or scratch won't be able to jump over it let's make it about 80 of what it was before and my start location for my fruit you notice when i move my bananas around this goto block changes so if i want my fruit to start right here in the beginning of the program i can tell it to go to that x and y spot so when the green flag is clicked no matter what happens my fruit is going to start off right there then i want it to glide all the way over here what is that position right now he's at minus 233 minus 160. so i'll just change this to that to those numbers let's see what that looks like and then we don't want the bananas just hanging out over here so let's hide them so every time i click the green flag i didn't make them reappear they're still hiding i need to show them at the beginning so every time i click the green flag the monkey's throwing some bananas at scratch well i don't want to just keep clicking the green flag so i need to get that in a loop that's a control block so forever won't you just keep doing that maybe we'll give scratch a little bit of a break we'll wait how about 0.2 seconds just a little bit of a break there i don't want it to always be bananas let's change it up i think that taco is too big let me go change that costume we have the fruit selected i'll go to costumes select the taco just drag that a little smaller i need to make sure the little plus that's the middle of the taco is in the middle of my image that makes the taco the same size as the other fruit all right scratch cat we need some code for you let's click on scratch cat change his name to scratch i want him to jump when i press the space bar and in case he's somewhere else on the screen we want to make him go to a starting position which scratch makes it so easy right here where scratch is right now is where my blocks say to put him to i don't even have to figure out what the x and y is it's already there if i wanted to make him glide up there and then glide back down that would be an easy jump but i want it to look a little better than that if i want to repeat for 10 that i want to change y by 10 and he would just keep going up and then if i did a minus then it would come back down but i don't want him to do it at the same speed we need a variable make a variable called speed first we're going to change speed to be 15. at first speed will be 15 and so y is going to change by 15. but every loop my speed is going to go down so every time through the loop speed will get smaller and y will get smaller and then we got to bring him back down if we repeat this say 30 times let's see what will happen and we just need to change y one more time to get him back to a starting spot oh food's coming way too fast let's look at the code for the food we need to glide over what does two seconds look like about one and a half seconds i think we're gonna have to get that food a little smaller he's going to lose a lot all right let's make another variable to keep track of our score we can just call it score let's make it a capital s so it'll look better because it's going to be on the screen right there we don't need speed up there let me uncheck speed but we do want score and every time we glide past scratch without him getting hit we want to add a point to our score so we'll change score by one and see it just keeps going up and we need to add the code to scratch so that it'll stop the game whenever he gets hit we need this code always running always being ready to find out if we've been hit so it has to have a separate green flag and it's going to keep running forever and it's going to say if scratch is touching some food then it's going to stop the code so if he senses that he's touching some food so it's under a sensing block if he's touching bananas all right after i put this code here i haven't hit the green flag yet and so it's not working but as soon as i hit the green flag it's going to make us lose see he senses that he's touching some fruit now so it stopped all the code and my score is 61. if i hit the green flag it's just gonna keep my score like that so i need to reset my score to zero every time the game is started my score is a variable so it's under the variables at the beginning of the game set score to zero it works we made a jumping game that's the end of this lesson click like and subscribe below so i can keep making tutorials and more people can find them now it's your turn to create a jumping game select any background that you like and any main character that you like and think about what you would like to glide over or roll over as an obstacle to your character you'll have to add the code to make your character jump whether you use repeat or glide it doesn't matter and you'll have to add the code to stop the game whenever your character is touching the obstacle if you can make your character jump over an obstacle then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free coding lesson was provided by stem in games watch
