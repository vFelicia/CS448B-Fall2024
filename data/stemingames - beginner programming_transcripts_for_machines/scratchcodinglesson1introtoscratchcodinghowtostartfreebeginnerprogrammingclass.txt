welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us once you get to scratch.m you could jump right in click on create and start writing code but i recommend that you go to join scratch by just making up a username and password so that you can save your project if you don't want to be online you can download scratch and install it on your computer look down at the bottom where it says download today we're going to create something like this here in the middle is the code that makes my character move up here is the stage where you can see what's going to happen when you run the code below the stage are all the characters that are in your program i only have one character the lady that's dancing to the right of the characters are the stages for this program there's only one stage on the left side are all the blocks that you use to write your code the blocks that you want to use you'll drag out into the coding area and connect them together different types of blocks have different colors the code for this program says when the green flag is clicked that's up here then i want you to loop forever just keep looping and within that loop go to the next costume and wait for one half of a second and that's the costume for our character this is the code for the one character that we have when we click the green flag it plays music and goes to the next costume so let's start a new project and i'll show you how i did it once you've created your account then click on create to create a new project the default character is this scratch cat i'll click on the trash can right here to delete him and i want a new background for my stage so i'll go here to choose a backdrop scroll down and pick the spotlight stage and you see up here in my preview i can see that the stage is selected this area here my characters are called sprites scratch calls characters sprites so it says the sprite name different information about the sprites but right here i'll choose a sprite when you pointed a sprite you can see all the different costumes that they have it cycles through the different ones cassie is the one that i had before that was dancing so i can see if any of these other ones are dancing so i'll pick champ this time and you'll see champ is on my preview he's too big for my stage so i'm gonna have to use code to make him smaller how big he is is how he looks and so that's going to be in my looks blocks so i'll click on looks to jump to the purple blocks right now his size is one hundred percent let me see what sixty percent looks like and i'll click on it to run this code and that's much better don't be overwhelmed by all the different kinds of blocks that we have to write code with you don't have to know it all in the beginning and you'll learn what all of these do so we want champ to start dancing when we hit the green flag that's an event when the green flag is clicked there's different ways to make your sprite move but today we're going to just change their costume let's look at champs costumes these are all the different costumes that he has we're just going to make him change from one costume to the other and that's going to be his dance i'll go back to the code so when the green flag is clicked i want him to change costumes that's going to be how he looks we'll go to the next costume so when the green flag is clicked he goes to the next costume but we don't want to keep clicking on that to make it work we want it to loop looping is in the controls blocks so we want him to keep dancing forever so we'll pick the forever loop so when the green flag is clicked we're going to keep looping forever and go to the next costume then the next costume but it's way too fast so we want to pause after he goes to the next costume we want it to pause we can do that with this weight block he's going to wait one second now it goes to the next costume waits a second goes to the next costume waits a second but one second is too slow let's do a half a second which is point five that's a pretty good speed now we just need some music we want the music to start when the green flag is clicked that's an event the music is in the sounds blocks we're going to play the dance celebrate song when the green flag is clicked it's going to play the song dance celebrate but then it's going to stop so we want to make that loop forever so that it'll keep in the song as long as champ wants to dance let's see how that works hey the loop is working we'll find out how to get different songs in a later episode let's see how it looks full screen hey that's the end of this lesson now it's your turn create a scratch account and create a new project add a background and a character and make your character dance be sure when you select a character that it has multiple costumes so that you can just choose next costume to make your character dance remember you can just point at the character to see all the different movements that they have in their costumes if you can select a background and make a character dance then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free coding lesson was provided by stem games watch more lessons and keep practicing so you can create new worlds and games and make your ideas come to life i'll see you next time bye
