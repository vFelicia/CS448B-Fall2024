welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write you will need the scratch junior app on your ipad android tablet or computer scratch junior is a free download and you'll have to get it so that you can do coding with us today you're going to create something like this we're going to have just a few seconds to memorize everything that's behind these cards you ready i'm going to hit the green flag we have a rabbit a fish a pig a dog did you memorize it that fast so we're creating a memory game i remember there was a rabbit here where was the starfish i think the starfish was here that's the dog so i got one point for the rabbit i didn't get the dog is the starfish on this one okay and i think the pig was right here and the frog was right here and the fish was right here so i got five points out of six so are you ready to make a memory game if we look at our characters let's see what coding it has for the characters there's not any how about for the pig the dog the frog there's no coding for the characters there is coding for each of these cards when you click on the card it goes away so here's all my different cards let's look at the code for one of these cards so when you touch it this symbol this block makes it go invisible so when it's touched it goes invisible let's look at another one i'm going to click on it and it goes invisible another thing that the car does is whenever you click on the flag it just wiggles a little bit it moves to the left it moves to the right wiggles a little bit and then it disappears it gives you 20 time it's not 20 seconds it's just 20 units of time and then it shows up so let's see what that looks like it wiggles it's giving us a little bit of time to look at it then it come goes back visible and then that's the end let's look at that again so it's gonna when i click the green flag it's gonna wiggle a little bit get invisible for a little bit of time for us to learn it and then it shows back up and hides it from us and it stops and it doesn't do anything else until we click on it and then it goes invisible again so we have this little bit of time to memorize it and then it shows back up so that's the game we're going to create today click the plus to create a new project let's get rid of tick by holding down and clicking the x let's get some new characters we'll get the dog a pig and a frog let's make the pig a little smaller so he can hide behind the card we'll make the dog a little smaller so he can hide behind a card too you know from previous lessons whenever i click on the dog this is the coding area for the dog when i click on the pig this is his coding area and the frog we haven't done anything to him yet and we're done making him smaller so we'll get rid of that and we don't need to make the dog any smaller either let's just do three cards to memorize in our memory game today if we go into our characters do you see anything that could be used for a card to go over them we're going to have to go into the editor and draw something ourselves because we don't have anything here we're going to have to draw something so i'll click on the paint brush here to edit a photo i'm going to draw a square and get a little bit lighter green and fill my bucket up with that green and then dump my bucket in the square that's a good size it covers it up now i need three of these characters you could go in and draw it three times but a really easy way to copy that character is to hold down on it hold down on it and drag it into this scene and let it go now there's two of them if you hold down on it and you don't move it's going to think you want to delete it so don't do that just hold down on it and move really quick and let it go on your scene now i have three of them so i have three cards and we'll put the third card over the frog so i have three cards here we could rename them if we want to card one card two and card three so do you remember what we have to do for the card what kind of programming do we need to do for the card whenever you first start the game and you hit the green flag you want it to disappear for just a little while so when we hit the green flag the purple blocks makes it look different and so underneath the purple block is something to make it disappear and after that we're going to make it reappear which will make it cover up the animal again but we have to wait a little while give the players of your game just a little bit of time to memorize what's behind the cards so we'll give them about 20 on the clock and then it'll reappear and then it'll so when we hit this green flag let's see what happens so it disappeared for a count of 20 and then it showed back up so that works perfect now we could redo that for all three of our cards or we could just drag this code to card number two and drag this code to card number one i just let go and look it has the same code for card number one the same code for card number two so let's see what it looks like now we have time to memorize it and then they show back up but when i click on them it doesn't show me if i'm right so let's just say i'm playing this game i click on the flag and i try to memorize that it's a frog and then what else i don't remember okay but i do remember this is a frog so i'll click on it and see if i'm right click on it and nothing happened we're missing some code so for card number one we want it to do something when we click on it that is this yellow starting block what we want it to do is disappear again that's in our appearance blocks right here it disappears and that's the end that's all we need it to do so which one is card number one this one that one this is card number one because when i clicked on it it disappeared so we're gonna if you look at card number two and card number three it does not have this code in it let's just drag that to card number two and let go drag that to card number three and let go and all three of them have all that coding that we just did so we have just a few seconds to memorize it it was a frog and a pig and a dog i got three points if you want to have some pictures so that the players of your game know what's behind the cards because this happens so fast they have just a few seconds and then it disappears and they don't remember if there's even a starfish back there there's a fast way to make another copy of these characters so we could put them down here i'll just drag it without deleting it i'll just drag it to the scene drag a copy of the pig to the scene drag the frog to the scene i'll mix them up and then when your players play the game and they click on the green flag and they have just a minute to memorize it and then they know the characters are supposed to guess okay where was the fro where was the dog he's right here where was the pig he was right here makes it a little easier when you can see them now it's your turn create a new project add some characters to your project and then cover them up with some rectangles or squares any shape that you want and make a memory game out of it we've learned a couple of shortcuts today we've learned how to drag a character from one of your characters that you already have onto the scene to make a copy of it we've also learned how to copy code from one character to another character by just dragging it from this programming window onto the other character so you can make use of those shortcuts and make your own memory game today we also learned how to make characters disappear and reappear if you can make characters in your game disappear and reappear to make this memory game then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free kids coding lesson was provided by stem and games subscribe
