hi welcome to learning to code with Python lesson 3 variables variables are a really important concept in programming variables like a label it's a shortcut for pointing at something that we want to save here are some examples so I've set apples equal to 10 so now if I say print apples I see that apples now is equal to the number 10 if I want to change what apples points to I can say now make apples equal to 15 you can also store other things than numbers in a variable for example variables can be named just about anything you can think of it's usually a good idea to pick a name that makes it clear what the value means for example if we were making a game where your goal was to collect flowers that might be a good name for the variable like this if you name it bubbles then later when you want to print out the score you're going to be confused by why the number of flowers you've collected is called bubbles so now that we know what variables are let's talk about what kinds of things we can store in them information inside the computer is called data and there are lots of different types of data that the computer can remember let's start with numbers we've used those a few times already did you know you can use the Python shell like a calculator try this out we can add numbers you can subtract numbers we can multiply that asterisk there is the symbol for multiplication it's the number above the eight on your keyboard so press Shift + 8 to get it and last you can of course divide you can also calculate with variables you remember we have our apples variable well apples times 2 is 30 another type of data we can work with is text remember our first program we printed hello world to the screen the stuff inside the quotation marks is called a string a string just means a bunch of characters those characters can be letters numbers whatever we can type we put them inside quotes so the computer knows that they're not commands here's an example see I put the word our engine quotes so now fruit is equal to orange what if I left the quotes out I get an error message right because it thinks orange is a variable so orange should be pointing at something but we never told orange to point at anything so the computer doesn't know what we mean let's see a little more about how strings work strings can be added together you see how adding those two strings together just push them together I didn't include a space so the computer didn't put one there either in fact every string is just a bunch of individual characters added together that's why they're called strings will work more with strings later in the class all right I've reset my window just so it won't be so cluttered you don't have to do that if you don't want to so the last type of data I'd like to talk about is a list lists are really useful if you need to keep track of a bunch of things this is what a list looks like we use a square bracket and then any number of items can go inside it separated by commas you can also make lists that are lists of strings so for example my friends are Bob to add Alex that's a list now how would we use these let's imagine that we're building a game about wizards and the player has to collect a bunch of items to make a magic potion with a list we can keep track of what's in their backpack and let's say they've collected a bat I some slug slime and a lizard gizzard okay and that's their list of items inside their backpack now when the computer has items in a list it keeps track of them by numbering them however when a computer counts it counts a little differently from how you or I might do it it always starts counting at the number zero these numbers are how it keeps track of what place in the list each item is and that's called an index let's see how we would use indexes backpack number zero is the first item in the list backpack number one item number one is the slug slime but what if we say we want backpack item number three well we get an error message all right it says the index is out of range that's because the list only has an item number zero on item number one and an item number two there is no item number three it takes a little getting used to to remember to start counting with zero but with practice you'll get used to it in no time now lists are useful because if we want to change something we don't have to retype the whole list let's say that instead of slug slime the wizard actually has red slug slime well we can just change that one item I want to change backpack item number one to be red slug slime now if I print out the whole backpack only that item has changed we didn't have to worry about changing any of the other items in the list you
