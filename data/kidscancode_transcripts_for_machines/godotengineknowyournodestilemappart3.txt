welcome back this is part three of our look at the Godot tile map node this time around we're going to be looking at how to do animated tiles which is something a lot of people have requested and also how to work with isometric tile Maps okay let's get started so to start with I've selected this tile set from open game art which have some animated tiles to do some shimmering water effects I'm not going to bother with the waterfalls too many top to deal with so we're just going to make a little island with some shimmering water around it so go ahead and grab this from open game art I'll have the link below now I've actually gone ahead and sliced all these into individual tiles you don't have to do that you can use you can use the region rectangle to define which parts you want in your sprites I did that because I wanted some flexibility to show you some different things to do so I just thought it was gonna be useful to have some different tiles so I basically took all these sprites and I just drag them into the window here to get my start making my tile set so these are all the island ones I don't care about those but this one water one or two and water three these two these three are the ones that I'm going to animate so in the folder I have water one has five frames of animation what or two has five frames of animation and what it three has five frames of animation so each of these is the first frame of its animation okay so just save that and convert it into a tile set like normal and then we'll be able to go over and make our tile map okay here's a tile map and I've just drawn out a little island and then you see I've used the water one water too and water three tiles and place them in a few places around the island where I want the shimmering water to appear now I've also added if you notice when we run this these files are fairly small so the picture is going to be small so I've added a camera to D just so that we will zoom in use that to zoom in a little so we can see the map a little bit better when we run it now we're going to add an animation player to our scene and this is what we're going to use animator tiles so we're going to create a new animation I'm just going to call it water and then we need to start adding tracks and I'm going to add a track for each of the three water tile animations that I want to do so let's do the first one so we go to our tile map and right here is where we've chosen our tile set that we're using and what our one is tile number zero in the set so if I click the right arrow here I can see all the individual tiles in the tile set and their properties and so for tile number zero its texture is what I want to animate so I'm going to click the key next to it to make a keyframe and now we have our first frame set now the length of our animation right now is one and our animation has five tiles so we should be fine I think if we just do two steps in between each one so now the second frame we want to go into our animated water and find what our one frame number two drop that in the texture hit a keyframe repeat again for the third one and repeat again for the fourth one don't forget to hit the key each time after you change the image and hit the key okay so there is our animation let's make it loop and hit play and there we go the places that I've put a water one tile are now showing the little animation and we're just going to repeat that for the other three and so here I've just done the same thing with the other two animated tiles and you can see they're each playing their animation if you anytime you add more of these you're going to see the animation on that tile because we're animating that tile in the tile set so it will be animated wherever it is so hopefully that helps you go and make some animated tiles in your tile map just for your information there is a second technique for doing this that uses a shader instead of the animation player I will probably be doing a video separately for that shaders are a whole separate topic of conversation so whenever that gets done I'll try and remember to link that below so you can check that out as well all right let's go on to isometric Maps the most complicated thing about an isometric map can be the art itself if you don't have a good art pack that hasn't been drawn in a consistent style and perspective it can get really difficult to to use it properly so for this demo I've selected Kenny's isometric tower descents art pack so all the tiles are now in the folder here and we just want to make our tile set and we can do that same way we've done our top sets before we're just going to drag all the sprites into the scene and they will get created with their correct names taken from the file name so they're easy to keep track of and that's all you got to do don't worry about anything else now one thing I will point out here is if we take a look at one of these tiles if you look at the texture the texture is 124 pixels wide and 123 pixels tall and that's how much the whole tile takes up and this is actually going to be true for all the tiles even the flat ones like this they're all the same size but the size of our grid is going to be based on this diamondshaped portion here that's that's the grid part of your tile map and so you have to get the right setting on your tile map and we're going to talk about how to do that next so if we go over to our new scene and we add a tile map to it so we're going to change the mode to isometric and if you look at it now it doesn't look guy symmetric it looks like it's just topdown because we need to change the size well let's load our tile set so we can see what's going to happen when we use it so I'm going to go and grab my topdown tile set okay and here's my tiles let's just grab a plain ground one and you can see we're not placing these at all lined up because we don't have our tile size step correctly and that's because it's set to 64 by 64 now when you're doing isometric there's a lot of different ways of doing isometric some artists will draw pure isometric tiles which means that the width is twice the height like that so if your tile is 64 pixels across it remains sorry 120 pixels across it's 64 tall that does not match these tiles quite as you can see they don't line up when you place them and that's because of again the size now if you look at Kenny's art pack when he released it he included in the download a file listing the proper size for the grid and this is what that file had in it 124 by 123 is the size of the images and 120 by 98 should be the size of the tiles well I think that that is not correct because if we put in here 120 by 98 oops 98 then you're going to see that these tiles don't quite don't line up at all with that size so you can see when we demand that tile shape is no it's not very close at all to matching the size of the tile image so you can experiment with this and this is what I did was play around with getting things closer by changing the Y size see 16 8 it too far and it turns out that 120 by 70 makes things line up just right and this is actually a pretty common hassle that you have to go through when you're getting isometric art off the internet and you're not quite sure or there's some mistake in the size and you have to play around with it for a while until you get things working correctly now our tiles are lining up right but you might have noticed that the highlight box where them where the tiles being placed is kind of above where the tile actually goes and we can fix that by just telling it to use the center of the tile as the origin then everything is lined up just right on the correct perspective so now we have our town maps set up and ready to go and I'm going to name this tile map level 1 this is the ground level because we want to have taller structures that rise up above this like towers and things like that okay so let's say you have some tiles here on the ground and you want to place some towers all right we have all of these tiles for making towers that would rise up above the ground we obviously don't want to place them here because that's going to replace the tile that you're clicking on right and I want the ground to stay there so we want to have a second tile map that is on top of the first one so the easiest way to do that is to duplicate this I'm going to hit command D or ctrl D and now we made a second map that map also has the same tiles on it so if I hide level one you can see we need to erase all of these on level two okay now I want to place this tower now if I click it it's just going to sort of be on top of the other one because it's being drawn on top it's higher in the node right if it was disorder you wouldn't see it because level one would be getting drawn on top but I need to change its location because it's higher it should look like it's shifted you know onto this tile not inside the tile and so we want to take our second level tile map and we want to offset it a little bit and we can do that because a tile map is just a node to D it has position information so we can shift this now I want to shift it upward so that's a negative amount and again from experimentation I found that about twenty eight pixels makes it shift just enough to look like it is centered on that tile so you can see it looks like that Tower is right there so basically each level that you add if we duplicate this and add another one because we want another layer on our tower then we need to take that one and we need to shift level three negative twenty eight times two and then that will let us draw on here and look like we're stacking on top show you one more we'll take this one and this will be negative twentyeight times three and we'll put the top on the top of the tower there and now we have a nice stacked up tower looking like it is in the right location and this can be all sorts of fun to play around with so here's a map that I went ahead and made because I was enjoying myself made it cover the whole screen I have made four additional levels of towers sticking up in various places and it looks when you run it it looks like this and I even did a little animation on one of the tiles like in the previous section just so you could see what it looks like with a different kind of tile and the important thing to remember about an isometric tom map is there's nothing different about the tile map from an orthogonal one the only difference is in how its drawn and the perspective of the tiles the way that the map works is exactly the same for example if we run this we use the code that we put in the previous example to tell us what tile we're on when we click you'll see that when I click over here in the corner this is zero zero this is the zero zero tile so this is X increasing as I go along the tiles and this is y decreasing as I go upwards so if you imagine it was just a square grid that was rotated you're still moving in XY coordinates and so if you have a character on the map and you have them at a certain tile say they're right here at eight zero and you tell them to move one Kyle to the right they will move to there to square number nine zero and it'll work exactly the same your code doesn't even need to know that you're on an isometric map so I hope you enjoy it going through this threepart examination of the tom map node it's very powerful can be used for a lot of things we've only really barely scratched the surface at this point but I encourage you to open it up an experiment with it and see what you can make it do thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video you
