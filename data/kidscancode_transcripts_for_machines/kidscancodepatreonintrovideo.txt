hi I'm Chris Bradfield founder of kids Canan code since we started two years ago I've taught hundreds of kids how to code in workshops after school classes and summer camps at all levels from beginner to Advanced I truly believe that computer programming is a valuable skill that every child should have the opportunity to learn it teaches important problem solving and critical thinking skills and it's a lot of fun at the same time in order to make the curriculum I've created more widely available I've decided to start a YouTube series of lessons we're starting with the basics but the ultimate goal is that these lessons will grow to cover all kinds of intermediate and advanced level topics that will allow kids to continue to expand their knowledge more importantly these videos will all be free available to all students regardless of their resources to help make this all happen I've created a patreon campaign you can see the link below in the notes what is patreon patreon is a way to support content creators similar to Kickstarter or Indiegogo the difference is that those sites are more about onetime events or single projects while patreon is more about about longterm support for creators you just choose an amount to contribute per video and also set a maximum so you'll always know exactly how much you're contributing the video series will always be free for everyone each month I'll be releasing a new set of lessons and patreon contributors will get first access to them along with the lessons will be the accompanying code files covering the examples from the lesson and suggestions for students to practice and expand on them patrons will also be able to vote on and make suggestions for future lessons by contributing on patreon your help me to devote the time and resources to create more videos and content thanks for watching and I hope that you'll help support me in teaching more kids to code
