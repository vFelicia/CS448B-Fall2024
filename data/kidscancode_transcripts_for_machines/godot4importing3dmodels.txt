welcome back to gdau recipes in this video we're going to be talking about how to import 3D assets into your gdau project for this demo we're going to use some art packs from K on itch.io and specifically we're going to use the dungeon remastered and the adventures character pack and these are just fantastic they're all really well done and the adventures pack you know has multiple characters and a ridiculous number of animations uh for each of them so this will be a really good example of how to get all sorts of different kinds of assets into good so download both of these and then we'll drag those into our project now the first thing you're going to notice when you unzip all of these is that there are multiple versions of all the files and we want to make sure we use the ones that are most compatible with good which are going to be the gltf versions and so in the adventures pack we're going to drag this character items folder the characters folder and then from the dungeon remasters we're going to grab the gltf folder and I drag those all three of those into my project folder here in my new good project and make sure that you give it a little time because there are a lot of files in these folders good is going to take a few seconds to scan through them all all right let's start with the characters and if you select the Knight here and look at the import tab you're going to see some of the basic import settings that we can change for this particular scene but I'm going to go ahead and click on Advanced here to pop up this window which gives us a lot more access to what's in the character and what we can do with it when we import it on the left you're going to see all the nodes that are going to be imported when we when we use this so there's a a whole bunch of meshes in here there's a skeleton with the rig and here you can see all the animations and the first thing I'm going to do is go over here to the root type and we're going to change this to character body 3D so that's the node type we're going to want our character to be when we use it and then I'm also going to go look at some of these animations so for example let's go find the idle animation and in the idle animation you want to make sure we want this animation to be looping when it's imported so you're going to need to go over here and pick linear it's going to be set to none I've already done it with this one set this to so that when it Imports it will automatically be a looping animation and some of them we want to do that like attacks we would want to only play once but idle the walking animations the running animations and the various idle animations we're going to want to set to looping so go ahead and do that with each of them and then click repport and you'll be good to go all right what about the dungeon items so down here here in the dungeon pack there are a huge number of files and it's kind of hard to just scroll through them I'm going to go ahead and put wall here in the filter so we can find the plain wall object and look at its import settings now the thing about the walls is we want them to be solid objects that we can't walk through and so we want to add Collision to these and it would be really tedious to go to each one and add a uh create it then add a static body then add a collision shape and so we can do this on import if we click on the mesh here we can say turn on physics and then it'll automatically choose static here we want it to be a static body and then we can choose how we want the Collision to be created to so like tresh we'll use the mesh itself to create the Collision which for this one isn't really all that necessary we don't care about these little bumps and everything uh so the simple convex is probably fine which just does an outline or you can use decompose convex which tries to make one uh you know with as few pieces as possible for this particular one it doesn't matter for different ones you'll need to look at what Collision shape works best for what that object's going to be but set that and click reimport all right so now once you've imported the scenes that you want let's go back to the Knight here and if you right click on it and say new inherited scene you'll get a new scene with this root character body 3D like we chose and underneath all of the nodes that came in from the glb file uh now one thing you'll notice is hands are kind of full because the artist has gone ahead and included all the different weapons and shields rigged and attached at the right place places so they'll work with the animations which is great and you can just go along and hide uh the ones you don't want so there I'm just leaving the onehanded Sword and the round shield and down here you'll see the animation player where you can sort of go and look at all the animations in individually and play them and see what they look like there's a a attack there's a block holds up the shield right you can play around with these and make sure they all look good and figure out which ones you want to use for your game notice idle here is in looping mode so when I play this that animation is going to just keep repeating and that's it once we've got our character imported the way we want it and we've imported all of the dungeon items we want that we can start building our dungeon with we're ready to start working on the game and we'll tackle that in the next part thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one please don't forget to like the video and hit that subscribe button so you'll get
