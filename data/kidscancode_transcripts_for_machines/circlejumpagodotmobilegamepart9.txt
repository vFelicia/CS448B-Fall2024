welcome back to part 9 of the circle jump game development series in this installment we're going to test the game out on my phone fix a couple of bugs and add a little bit more visual flair alright let's get started so before going any further in the game I thought that it would be a good time to do a little Android testing so I exported the project onto my Android phone I've had Samsung Galaxy s8 and I realized also as I'm recording this that I don't have a good camera to show you what it looks like on the phone but the project exported fine and it ran but there was a problem and it had to do with the HUD and I'm gonna show you in the HTML export has a similar problem so I'll show you what it looks like and then we'll look at how we can try fixing it so here's the game running in an HTML export and watch what happens when I hit play just yet stuttering let's go there there did you see that so it seems that whenever we play this animation on the HUD the one that shows the message this animation is lagging like crazy and on the phone it's very very bad and so I did some experimentation one thing I thought was that might be GL es 3 so I switched over to GL ES 2 and I exported on that phone and it was a little better but it wasn't still wasn't working right so it wasn't smooth and so I was about to give up and thinking that maybe we would have to go with you know do this message in a different way when I realized that if I go over here into the project settings under rendering quality there's an option called use over sampling for dynamic fonts and guess what we're using for our message we're using a dynamic font so if I turn that off it becomes silky smooth on the phone so for now I'm going to stick to GL es 3 again we're still I'm reserving that decision until we get some more testing done but for right now it works fine with either so let's talk about exporting real quick the best place for you to go if you want to learn how to export your project is on the Godot Doc's there is an exporting tutorial and it talks about exporting the dodge the creeps tutorial game but the process is pretty much the same you have to download the export templates for the version of Godot you're using and then you can set up presets for whatever platforms you want to exports project to and in the case of Android you're also going to need to download the Android SDK and the Java JDK and that will install all the tools you need to have your computer talk directly to the phone and or whatever device you have and let you generate your keystore which you need in order to compile the project and when you do that it's really nice I when I plug in my phone to the usb I get this window this little button appears right here which lets me export if I click on the little robot I can choose my phone and it will compile the project upload it to my phone and launch it all with one click if you're curious how to do it for iOS it's a bit more cumbersome you have to have Xcode installed which means you have to be on a Mac and there's a few more steps you got to go through to get the project exported so we're gonna stick to Android to begin with because it's a lot more frictionless once we're ready and we're pretty confident that we're done with the project we're ready to put it on the App Store we can deal with the iOS exporting then alright let's get on to the next feature we're gonna add I'm gonna make a new scene here and I'm going to use a canvas layer this is gonna be my background this is gonna sit behind the game and give me something besides this boring gray nothingness and so this is a canvas layer which means I wanted to I want to use the X I wanted to be behind everything else so I'm gonna put it on layer negative one so that it'll be behind everything let's save that and then it's going to have a color rect set to full rect that's going to be our background let's just stick that to black to start with and already over here if we add this to our main like instance this in here and we have a nice black background and now we have a nice black background and then I also this is another thing that's gonna require some testing I like the way it looks but it also could be problematic with our phone export which is I want to add a world environment and we're going to say new environment and background mode we're going to set to canvas that's what this is going to produce and I want to turn on glow depending on how you have the settings the glow can be a little overdone but if you use it subtly it can look pretty good here are the glow settings I have settled on intensity 0.37 threshold point six four and additive mode and that's gonna look pretty Goods going to give the circle as a nice glow little neon effect and the drawback to this is glow does not work in GL es too so if we wanted the effect in GL ES 2 we would have to write a shader so depending on what we finally decide this might go back out the window again but until then I'm gonna keep it in there it was easy enough to add and it's easy enough to disable if it isn't working okay the other thing I'm going to add to the background here is I'm going to add a CPU particles to D and this is just like a particle to denote it just uses the CPU instead of the GPU to do its animation and it is a little more mobile friendly against our game is not going to be at all taxing on the phone CPU we have only a few objects on the screen at a time not a lot of not a lot going on it's not 3d CPU particles we can be fine with now if you've done particles before you know there's a lot of settings that you can play around with and what I want this to do is to make a sort of background of floating circles as if they're off in the distance so smaller circles that are just sort of coasting down so I'll put in all the settings then I'll just go over them rather than have you watch me do everything okay so here the particles doing their things they're just sort of coasting down in the background so I set the amount of for the lifetime to 20 that's how long they're gonna stay alive preprocessing 210 that's so that when we first hit run it's not going to be empty and we'll see the first one come on though it'll pre run some of the anime or some of the particles so that they look like they've been running for some time already in the draw section I've put the circle texture same one we used for our circle in the game I change the emission shape to a box which means that's where these will spawn so I've increased it to 240 in Y you notice it's going x and y and you'll see why in a minute spread I set to zero gravity I set to zero initial velocity is 75 with a random factor of 0.6 that's why some of them are going a little faster and some a little slower scale I set to 0.2 because you know the full full scale is way too big and then I have a little bit of randomness on that too so that they're not all exactly the same size hue variation is how we're getting the different colors and then it's just centered above the top of the screen and I rotated at 90 degrees because the orientation of the particle node determines which direction this initial velocity is pointing so by default it's pointing along the xaxis so they were all emitting in this direction so since we rotated it 90 degrees that's why the variation in the box size is why because we're rotated 90 degrees but there we go so that looks pretty nice I think and will give us a little bit of something interesting to look at instead of a featureless nothing in the background and they're on a different layer from the circles so the glow does not apply to them all right that's going to do it for this one I'm going to put a copy of the android apk in the notes section below it'd be great if any of you out there with android devices could throw it on there or export it yourself and give it a shot and let me know how things work and we can try and get a handle on any other mobile issues that might be cropping up before we get too much further along in development all right thanks as always for watching please like and subscribe below and I'll see you in the next video
