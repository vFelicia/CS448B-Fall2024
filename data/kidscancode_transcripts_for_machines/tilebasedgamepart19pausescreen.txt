all right welcome back to in game development with Piegan this is part 19 of our zombie style topdown shooter table based game and in this video we're going to add a pause screen and maybe a couple other minor things so before we get to adding the pause menu there's a couple small things that I want to do and one of them is right now we have the zombies when they die oh by the way I did find a better pistol sound if you can hear that the bassam bees make that splat noise and they disappear but I want to leave you know some sort of indication that I've killed some zombies already and to do that I just made a little green splat image like this it just looks like a splatter and we're going to draw that on to the ground whenever we delete a zombie so so we're just going to load that image first that's the first thing we need to do so we're just going to call this the splat and we need to load from the image folder whatever this splat image is dot convert alpha and I've just added that to the settings over here it's splat green dot PNG and then I made that image large so that it would be we'd be able to use it at whatever scale we wanted so I'm going to scale it initially here to a good size I found that splat I found that 64 by 64 wound up being a pretty good size all right so there's our splat image and we're we now have it loaded and now we want to draw it whenever we add zombies he'll three to zero and we delete it you know and play that splat sound while we're doing that in the zombies code right here in my class mom so when my health when the zombies hell 3 to 0 it you know draws itself on this I mean it deletes itself it plays a splat sound and we want to also just draw it and so the place we're gonna draw that is on the game's map image we're gonna just draw that we're going to draw the splat image at whatever position the zombie was that a little bit right or half the size right cuz well I want to centered it where the zombie was okay so that's simple enough now when I kill a zombie I can see a nice little splat mark there on the ground and let's kill a few more any fewer back up a few okay and it looks nice you can see there's been some action here okay on to the pausing by the way as we go on I think you know this is usually the way I work on things too is every once in a while you get an idea for a small little little addition and you go and you take care of that before you go do the next big task it sometimes feels nice to add some of those little small things that might not be big enough for a whole video okay so in the new here we're gonna have a new variable called paused and this is whether the game is paused or not right and so that's going to be a flag that we can toggle by pressing a key so that means we're going to go down to our draw section or miss our events section and if we press the P key P for pause is what I'm gonna use then we just take the paused variable and we make it the opposite all right we invert it so now we have this variable that we can toggle between true and false but now what do we want to do when the screen or when the game is paused well there's a couple of things the first one is I want to make everything stop happening right I want to stop the game and the easiest way to do that and the simplest way to do that is of course much more complicated things you can do is here in the run loop right here update is what moves everything and makes it all go to different places so we're just gonna say if we're not paused then we're going to update so only if paused is false will we update all the sprites and do everything else that needs to happen here in the update section so take a look now we can run and when I hit P everything is frozen okay I can't move I can't do anything I hit P again everything starts going right so I can toggle between right so yeah pause though there's a bullet there okay so that's fine but it's also hard to tell that everything is paused so we want to have some kind of effect to notice notify us that the the game is paused the first thing we're going to do is we are going to add a function called draw text so I want to see the word paused on the screen now this draw text function I've just copied and pasted is this is very similar to the one we made for the shmoop game and that we used also in the platformer jumping game and this is just a function that what you pass to it is some text that you want to draw what font you want to use to do the drawing since week that way we can use different fonts for different things what size you want it to be what color you want it to be where you want it to be and an a line a line means what corner of the rectangle do you want to place at that x and y that way you can you know write justify or Center or however you want to place the text and you can see here depending on what value you pass it'll set a different a different coordinate of the rectangle to that position okay and it's just going to draw that text on to a location so you can pause it right here if you want to look through that code okay so we have this draw text function and we just want to draw it at a certain location and so the first thing I'm going to do is pick a font and what I did was I wanted to I wanted a nice thematic font that would work well for this game and I found I found this font called join this I'm just putting the font in the image folder along with the other art and it's it's called zombie dot TTS obviously you can use any TrueType font that you go and find yourself there's a lot of different great websites out there to have free open source or royaltyfree fonts that you can use for for making games but that's the font we're going to use and in fact I think we'll call this the title font because there might be other fonts we want to use for other bits of text that we want to show and we can load those later okay so we're gonna use the title font and then in our draw section down here where we're drawing everything on the screen if we're paused we're gonna draw that text so right down here at the end here cuz I want on top of everything else if we're paused then we're gonna draw we're going to use our draw text function the words we want to say are paused excuse me the font I want to use is the title font the size we're gonna do 105 we're doing it in red and I want it centered so I'm gonna say width divided by 2 and height divided by 2 and then the the align is going to be Center okay so now when we run it we will see that when I hit P it shows up and says whether I'm paused or not and that way I can tell when the game is paused and that's nice but I think we could do a little bit better and the other thing I want to do while the game is paused is I want to dim the screen and so dimming the screen means we want to basically a couple ways you could look at it we want to lower the brightness of everything on the screen or we want to draw a semitransparent gray kind of translucent image over top of the screen so it looks like it dims everything so what we want to do is we want to have a an image to use and so we're gonna go back up here to our load data here and what we're going to do is right here I'm going to make an image to dim the screen and it's just going to be a surface and it's size is just going to be the same size as the screen so we just say get get size and then I want to do convert alpha just like we do on every other image they definitely want this to have a transparency channel and then the dim screen I'm going to fill with black but with a alpha channel of 180 right so either that could be 0 or 255 to be maximum but I'm gonna put it somewhere in the middle because I want it to be dim and then what we can do is down in our draw section just like we're drawing the text we're also going to draw that image on top of everything so we're just gonna let that image the dim screen and we're just gonna put it at 0 0 so it covers the whole screen it's the size of the screen remember so if we draw it starting a knee up left hand corner it'll be the same size as a screen and so when we run it that's gonna look like that yeah isn't that nice so now as we're running around and seeing you know what's going on when we pause the game you know everything was dimmed a little bit and just to show you what difference that makes if we were to put let's say we were to at a much lower value here in the Alpha Channel this is gonna be brighter or dimmer well let's take a look it's not nearly as much right because if we've gone all the way to zero that would mean it would be fully transparent so we wouldn't see any change at all so basically that bigger didn't bigger you make this number you know the more closer to the closer to black it's going to be see there it's even dimmer so I kind of liked that a little more than middle range number of 180 for our pause screen there we go hopefully that was helpful to you in this game or any other game that you might be looking to put a pause menu in this is super super simple and straightforward way to do it and it looks really nice with that dim screen okay as always thanks for watching in the next video we are going to start adding some different weapon types I think the next one will be the shotgun so they nice different kind of weapon effect and as always please hit the
