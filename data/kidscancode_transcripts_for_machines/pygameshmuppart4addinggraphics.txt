welcome back to our PI game game development series this is part four of our game this time we're going to be adding graphics to the game the first thing we're gonna need if we're going to use some graphics is we need some pretty graphics and if you remember our right demo I talked about an artist named Kenny who has a lot of different things on open game art and one of his that I really like is called the space shooter pack and I'm gonna use that for the art in our shmoop game this one's awesome it comes with a lot of different ships and different colors it has lasers it has powerups it has all the different sized meteors that you can have flying around a lot of cool stuff and a little example of what it looks like right got some cool stuff there now you can go to open game art and you can download it right here or you can download it I've linked directly to it in the show notes below so if we look at the folder when we download it it's gonna be a zip file which when you open it up is gonna have all sorts of stuff in it there's a folder with backgrounds in it and what we want is this in this PNG folder and then the PNG folder we need three things we need a graphic for our players ship we need a graphic for our laser that we're gonna shoot and we need a graphic for our enemy now the enemy is just sort of the enemies are just sort of flying around a straight line so I'm gonna make these mobs that we have right now be some of these meteors that are in here and we can make some cool effects happen with those so what we need to do is take those graphics and move them over into our folder where our code is so what I've done is in my folder where I'm writing my code I have this IMG for image folder just like we did in the sprite example and in those I put the three graphics I'm gonna use the player ship orange is the one I chose the brown medium one meteor and the laser red 16 you can feel free to use different ones if you want to these are just ones that I'm going to use so let's switch back over to our code and get started here now if you remember when we did our sprite example and we loaded the graphic we had to do a little extra work to make sure that the code will work on whatever kind of computer you're using because different types of computers name the directories different things and we'll make it hard for your program to find the graphics you're looking for if you don't do this the right way so from OS we're gonna import path okay and then we're gonna just set up those to a folder for the for the images and I'm just gonna call it that its path join the directory name of whatever file whatever directory were in for the file and then I'm just say image okay so now we know this variable right here will be equal to whatever the path is to that IMG directory where we have our graphics in the right place okay and one other thing that I've done is I've added one other file which is this one which is a nice large space background to use on the background in my window I like this one a little better than the ones in the Kenny pack so again that one's linked below as well and you can get this it's called star field dot PNG we're gonna make that the background of our game so to start with why don't we load the background first okay so right here before we start up everything we're gonna make a little section where we load all game graphics okay so we need to load all those images in okay first one we're gonna make is called the background and that's going to be the image for a background so we're gonna say PI game image load and in the parentheses we want to put the name of the file which we just use that join again and we join the image folder that we already figured out with the name of the file which is star field Jade PNG and then always remember to put convert at the end we talked about that when we were loading graphics the first time and then because we've loaded that graphic and we need to know how to place it somewhere we can make a rect for it so that we will have a way to locate it okay and all we want to do with that background rect is draw it first every time we get to our draw section down here the first thing we want to do is we want to fill we want to draw that background before we draw anything else so basically instead of this green dot fill okay although the screened up fill is kind of useful there to erase any extra stuff if you just happen to mess up and have the wrong sized background image that doesn't cover your screen or something like that so we want to draw that background on to the screen so the command for that is on the screen we want to blitt BL I T lit is kind of an oldfashioned computer graphics term which basically just means copy the pixels of one thing onto another thing and we want to blitt the background onto our screen that's what this all sprites draw command is actually doing is it's going and bleeding all of your sprites it's just taking care of that for you since we're doing this one separately we're gonna need to do it ourselves so we're gonna blit the background and the location is the background rect which started out up in the upper left hand corner and we don't need to move it or anything so that should be fine and now we should have a nice background like that so let's go ahead and load our other graphics up here so we're going to load the player image again I'm just going to use IMG as the abbreviation for the word image so image dot load we're going to do the path dot join again with the image folder and then this one is called player ship one underscore orange dot PNG kind of a long name we might want to go back and shorten that at some point although it doesn't really matter we only have to type it in this one time and then I'm gonna actually just copy and paste that line so that I can just change it and make the meteor image the meteor image is named meteor Brown underscore medium one and the bullet image more of a laser not a bullet but good enough is called laser red sixteen okay so those are our other three graphics that we wanted to load so now we can start changing our sprites to use them so let's go to the player first so we want to replace the green rectangle and get rid of that fill and image is now just going to be player player image but there's a little something we got to check on and that is that is pretty big if you did you see how big that was it's pretty large I think I want to make it a little smaller well again that's the size of the graphic that the artist is drew right so we want to scale it and pygame can scale things so we can say we can say instead of just loading the image we want to say pygame gut whoops pygame dot transform dot scale and that'll let us scale the player image okay to a new size okay and I'm gonna make it about 50 by 38 and the way I figured that out was I went over to my graphic and I opened it up and just my little graphics program and I looked at the size okay and if I look at the size it is in pixels 99 by 75 so I just decided I wanted to make it about half that so if we went to 50 38 is the would be the height let me just divide them both by 2 just to get a size we kind of would like okay and now that's gonna look a little bit better yeah that's more the size that I want for my ship I still have room to dodge things okay now if you can see you can definitely see if you're doing this on your screen we still have the black rectangle around it because we didn't set our color key so we do need to say selftaught image set color key black so that we don't have any black outline around it okay so that's going to work for the player now let's change the mob I'm gonna do the basically the same thing although I don't think I need to scale that image I think we'll leave it the same size we're just going to use the meteor image and there we go they're all little meteors with black outlines so let's put set color key to black on those very nice very nice and now we can do the last one which is our little yellow bullets are going to change into being the bullet image and set color key to black on that and there we go and now we have some nice looking graphics with a pretty cool looking laser beam coming out starting to look fun now the only problem we still have and see if I can if you can notice this on my screen you might have noticed it on yours is did you see that did you see that collision it didn't look like the meteor was touching the spaceship but it still counted as a collision why did that happen well since we're already going kind of long we will address that in the next video but basically we need to look at the way the collisions are working and adjust our strategy for colliding you
