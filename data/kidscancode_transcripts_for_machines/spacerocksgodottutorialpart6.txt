welcome back to space rocks the goto game engine series where we're making a asteroids cloud in the last part we did work on making them asteroids explode when we hit them and split into smaller ones and so this time we're going to add some nicelooking explosion and sound effects to our asteroids okay now that we are shooting asteroids we want to add two nice looking explosions so I'm going to make a new scene flood that and we're going to use an animated sprite we handle this and I've added some art in here of an explosion of the eight frames of animation so make a new right frames I'm going to call this the regular explosion this is the normal sized one maybe we'll add some different sizes for the different sized explosions I started for the different sized asteroids after there we go okay for this one I think the FPS we have about ten we want the loop to be off I don't want it to repeat let's see we're going to start on zero it's not playing like it's playing to see it run through once that's all we need all right let's just name this explosion and save it in the scenes folder and add a script all right all we're going to do here with this script really we don't even need the ready function because what we're going to do is attach the event for finished I'm going to connect that and we're just going to say when it's finished we'll delete it so when we spawn one of these it's going to play out and then it's going to disappear now on our main we just want to instance one of these whenever we blow them and afterwards so explosion we're going to preload that and then down here is where we explode the asteroid so we just need to create an instance of this we need to add it as a child we need to set its position to position of B that's where we exploded and then we just need to tell it to play and that should be that let's go over here and shoot this guy comes on to the screen a little slow I think I'm gonna adjust to be speed a little bit maybe twelve things per second that'll be a little better yeah okay looking much nicer all right let's get some sound in here now so we're going to go to the players scene and we're going to add a sample player sample player with the little speaker icon next to it this is going to be the shoot shoot sounds and we have a little warning here because it needs a sample library well right here samples no we're going to make a new library go over here and add some stuff so in the audio folder I have some different wav files I'm going to use laser one and laser two these are one sound like this plays the two sounds like this so I have some options on how we can you know make our lasers sound as we have upgrades and things like that so playing a sound is super easy in your code you just have to tell it when you want to happen go over to our player script and let's get that node and we're going to use that down in our shoot function I'm shoot function here fires off when we are able to shoot so we're just going to say put this on the end shoot sound dot play and then you just put the name of the sound that you want to play actually I think I want to for this one and that should be it there go much gutter you know we just need to get a sound happening during explosion and we're going to do it the exact same way we're gets to in main I have just made another sample player called explosion sound expl sounds and I'm just playing explosion number one I've got three explosion sounds in here now which we could use for different things or even randomize but I'm giving it simple right now you know later we could even go in and make different explosions here that are named the same as the sizes right so big medium small and tiny and then have matching sounds so we would play and we would just use the size variable here to play the matching one and we can do that at some point but I'm not really really ready to do that yet this is good enough for us to be able to have a little bit of feedback it will fill up okay and finally we're going to do some music by adding a stream player node stream players what you use for background music because it just plays doesn't load the whole music file which might be a big song something like that and it streams it as it goes and just plays it in the background on its own thread and that is what we want so you need something in the stream property right and I happen to have an auxiliary and game art that works pretty well we put that in in there and we just have to tell it to play when we start the new game and so in our I'm just going to put this in our ready I'm just going to say get node music dot play that's all we have to do we go we have some background music and sound it back okay I'm going to get fun now in the next video I want to do some more work on the player and say I want to add a couple things here I'm going to add a sprite it's going to be our shield around the player ship because we have a nice shield graphic from our sprite sheet here there's actually where the there's there's actually three levels of shield I'm just going to grab the full one here and we need to resize that because just like we've scaled the ship to point 6 we're going to want to scale the shield the same I actually might make it even a little smaller yeah so it looks like it's around the ship and so the shield is going to just be the visual indication that we have our shields on and we'll be if we can just hide and show it the to make it look like this ship has a shield up shield down it's also pretty boring when we're flying around and so I'm going to add a little animated sprite here and this is going to be the exhaust from the ship's engine that is going to have a couple of frames in and one we're going to use our there's a bunch of different animations for different kinds of exhaust in here let's plow allbeef ones so we're just going to grab one of these blue ones here this one and we got this one and we need to move those down a bit take the position of the exhaust and I'm going to shift it let's see 30 a little more 35 yeah so it looks like it's coming out the back of the sniffs I'm going to put playing alright using about that it's going to look like not quite what I wanted let's try this other one yeah it looks like kind of like it's pulsing okay so we want that to be on when we're thrusting and off when we're not so we're just going to add into our code to turn it to show and hide it right just set it to visible or not visible which is our can be a little property right here so we already have here in our script where we're thrusting or not thrusting and so this is where we just want to set that property to so we're going to say get node exhaust and we're going to if we're trusting we're going to set grants a show and then do the same thing take the same line and we're going to duplicate here and put hide and now when we want to when we thrust we have a little fire coming out the back and when we let go of the key it's not there okay give the ship a little bit more personality as always thanks for watching I hope you're enjoying this series and I will see you in the next video you
