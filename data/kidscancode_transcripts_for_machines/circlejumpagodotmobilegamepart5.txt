welcome back to part five in the last part we added our UI for our game screens and in this one we're gonna do a little more UI work adding a HUD a headsup display for displaying our score and other information during gameplay okay we're also going to start with a canvas layer and this is going to be our HUD and our HUD needs to show two pieces of information our score which is going to be in we're going to use another margin container which I'm going to set to bottom wide and we'll set our custom constants again and inside of there I'm gonna put an H box with this is the this is the score box I'm going to call this so we have it labeled and inside of here are going to be two labels one to show the score which will use the font that we use before let's put some text in there just to have an example and we'll load the font we're gonna put it on the right I'm gonna add a second label I want this one on the left this is gonna say the word score and I want to load the same font except I want to change this size so I'm gonna go in here and grab the font and I'm gonna change the size by saying make unique all right let's fix the layout here so we'll set the size flags make sure the vertical side so I except to fill and that should line everything up just right okay the other thing we want our head to show is a message that's going to tell us when we go up a level and that kind of thing I'm gonna use the same font let's put some text in there and Center I'm gonna keep it centered I want to clip the text in case it goes bigger see why in a second and then we're gonna set it to Center wide like that and what I want to do with this message is I want to animate it I want it to look like it's growing and fading out so we're going to be in the animation player for that now two animations I want to add in here one that sets it to its starting values and one that will perform the animation so make our init one which is our starting one which can be very short it's going to set the messages font values so we need to make this unique as well it's going to set the size to our starting value and it's going to set the visible off so that it is invisible when it starts and then the second animation is going to do the animation let's make the length of this about 0.75 so I'm in a bit now we want to first thing we want to do is set the visibility on at time zero we're going to take the font size and we're going to animate that from there up to some really large value we want that to be continuous and then we also want it to fade out so we're going to take the modulate and we're going to keyframe that there and at the end with the Alpha down at zero so now our animation does that the message expands and fades out okay let's add a script to the HUD and this is going to do a couple of things we're going to have a show message function that will let us call that so we set the message text and we play the animation we're going to have a hide and show so that we can because the HUD itself is a canvas layer so it doesn't have its own show and hide methods but we can we just want to show and hide the score box when we're when the game ends and then the last one is we need to update this or and that is going to set the value into the score box now we can go back over to our mean and we can instance that HUD seen I had seen is there and now in our mean script we want to call Hyde on the hood when we start the game when we have a new game we're going to show it and also show a message and then we're gonna hide the HUD on game over which is here let's see what that looks like there's our go it's moving downwards instead of going straight so what's going on with that let's check our animation here so I think what we want to change here is on the message the yeah the grow direction should be both yeah that's what we want all right so we should be good to go there now we get go die play again yeah that looks good now that message is also going to show things like when we level up it's gonna it's gonna put level 3 a little for whatever maybe later when we have bonuses or things like that it can show messages like that all right now we need to just hook up that score so we're going to need a variable for that we're going to set it to 0 when we starting a game and call HUD update score and then we need to do the same thing when the jumper is captured we're just going to increment the score by one alright that'll do it for this part don't forget to subscribe below so you can get notified when the next part comes out and I'll see you then you
