welcome to learning Godot in this series we're gonna walk through making your first Godot engine project you'll learn how the Godot engine editor works how to structure a project and how to build a 2d game if you've never made a game or even coded before it might seem a little overwhelming but just follow along stick with it and it will all start to make sense the game we're gonna make is called dodge the creeps and it looks like this we press start and your goal is to avoid the enemies as long as you can try not to get hit and if you do you're dead if you haven't already downloaded it you can get the Godot engine from the website here just click on download and download the version for your operating system there's no install process just unzip the file and place the application in your Applications folder or wherever you keep your applications doubleclick it to launch we're going to start by making a new project and so I'm going to click on new project and I'm going to call this the Dodge tutorial and I'm going to create the folder in my folder where I'm putting on my Godot three projects and I hit create and that's going to create the project and automatically open it alright here we have our empty project now if you go to the tutorial the written tutorial on the Godot website there's a link to downloading the assets the art and sound that we're going to use for this game so you can go there and download this zip file I'll link to that in the notes below and you want to unzip that file in your new project folder that you just made alright so I've unzip that file and now I have two folders in my project file an art folder that has all of the assets we're going to use an a fonts folder that has a font we're going to use for the user interface our first stop is going to be in the project settings where we're gonna set the window size for our game so if we click on project settings there's a whole bunch of settings here and under display window is where you have a width and a height we're gonna set the width to 480 and we're gonna set the height to 720 and close that and we're gonna be ready to start making our scenes in this game we're gonna make three separate scenes one for the player one for the mob and one for the userinterface the heads up display and then those three scenes will be combined to make the game's main scene we're gonna start with our player node so over here in our empty scene we're gonna click + to add a node and the list of nodes is really long so rather than scrolling through and trying to find the one you're looking for the quickest way to find it is to click on search here and start typing in some of the letters that make up the name so for example if I type in a R and then that's going to find area D really quickly and area to D is what we want for our player because area to D lets you detect when other objects overlap or run into it and that's what we want for our player we want to detect when the mobs run into it so now I have an area to denote here for my player and I'm gonna double click on that and change its name to player that's what it stands for and then I'm going to click Save so you can either go over here and click Save scene or you can click the shortcut which is control S on Windows or Linux and command S on the Mac so if I hit that it's gonna ask me to save it we can just save this in the main folder of the project we don't need to create a whole bunch of folders we don't have a very complicated game here so we're gonna save this it'll be automatically named player dot scene because that's the name of the root node and we hit save now our character doesn't look like anything so we want to add the art from our art folder over here we've got some images to show our player as it walks around in different directions so we're going to add a child node to the player using an animated sprite this one right here we add that and when you first create an animated sprite it has this little warning symbol next to it which if you click on it you will see tells you a sprite frames resource has to be set in order for an animated sprite to work so that's what we're going to do next here in the inspector we can see the frames object and it's currently null so we need to click the down arrow here to create a new sprite frames resource and when we do that we've created a new empty one so we click on it here to edit it and that will open up this animations panel at the bottom of your editor window where you can create the various animations for your character on the left here is a list of animations we're going to take this default one and rename it to two right and then we're going to click the plus here to make a second one and name it up so we have two pieces of art for rightfacing animation and up facing animation now we just need to drag the frames in there so for the right one we want to drag this one in and this one N and on the up one we want to drag this one and this one and now we can see our character has some images there we can click the sprite frames button here to close that panel and then we can drag our window and zoom in a little bit to see our character a little better because now we want to add a collision shape so we know where the collision bounds of this area are so we're going to click on player again and we're going to add another node this time we're going to add a collision shape to D create that and that also has a warning when you first create it because it was what it's telling you is you have to tell it what shape you want this collision shape to be so right here in the inspector we see under shape we can choose from a variety of different shapes but for the shape of our character the capsule shape is probably the best fit so we're gonna pick that and now we need to size this shape so that it fits around our character and what you want to be very careful about is do not grab these outer points on the rectangle that is not going to resize your collision shape it's going to stretch it and that will cause all sorts of collision problems you always want to use the sizing handles that are on the inside of the shape so this one here will change the width this one here will change the height all right so just sort of size it so that it matches pretty well the shape of the character that we have because a little shorter and there we go now something else you want to be careful about is you have this collision shape to D if you're not careful you can accidentally grab it and drag it away from your character and then the collisions are going to happen over here but your character is over here and that gets very confusing and difficult to keep track of you want these child sprites the animated sprite and the collision shape to always be attached to this player node and when it moves you want them to move with it and so to prevent accidentally clicking and dragging them off you can click this button right here next to the lock that says make sure this objects children are not selectable if I click that a little symbol there appears to let me know but now whenever I click here I can only select the player node and that moves all of them together instead of pulling them apart so that completes our players scene now we want to make it move so in the next video we'll talk about how we can add a script to this player and control it to move around the screen
