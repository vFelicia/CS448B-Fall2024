welcome back to Goodell 101 this is part 11 and we're going to be talking about how to create animated sprites so here is our players team and in our arts folder we have all the art for the idle the jumping and the running animations and we just want to use those to make this character look animated well that means we can't use the plain old sprite what we're going to use instead is the animated sprite and we could add that node but a shortcut here is we can rightclick on this and say change type now I want to change it into an animated sprite okay so now all the textures have gone away and we have a warning here that's bright frames resource must be created our animated sprite needs to know what frames it's going to use so that's the first property right your frames click the down arrow and choose new and then click the right arrow to go into that frame and you're going to see a new panel open up here so over here you can define multiple animations over here in this section you're going to put the individual frames in the order you want them and over here you're going to put the speed how fast you want that animation to play and whether you want it to loop or not so let's start with idle the idle animation just uses these two frames I'm going to drag them into the animation frames window here and now if we go to our sprite we have a property you're called playing we turn that on and there you see it playing ok now I think that's a little sass so if we click back into the animation frames we can change the speed here to say 3 there we go now let's talk about adding the running frame there's six frames to that animation so we're going to click on new animation call this running and then I'm going to select all of these and drag them into there we're going at one through six and back to our sprite right here this animation properties which one of those animations we want to use so if I switch it to running now we've got the running animation I think that one needs to be sped up just a little bit so I'll depend on what it looks like once we see it that you get the idea so now in our code what we're going to need to do is tell the animated sprite node which would be the animations to play it when we're running to use this one and when we're standing still to use that one and then we're also going to use our flip h property to change this direction it's running or standing it okay so here we are in our player script and I've added a reference to the sprite node this as the name and we're just going to add a new variable for which animation we're going to be using idle or running and then in our fixed process this is where we're going to choose which one to use let's set the animation so first of all if our X velocity is equal to zero then the animation we're going to use is the idle one otherwise bring is the run one that's pretty simple but now we need to detect the or we need to choose the flip H whether we want it to be facing to the right or facing to the left so if Delta X is greater than zero then we're running to the right so our sprite needs to be set to native set foot H to false that's the normal Direction is facing to the right and then if it's less than zero we'll do the same thing but look set flip H to true notice this way if when we stop moving the flip H won't change so we'll stay facing the direction we we're already going then we just need to tell our sprite to play whatever animation we're supposed to be playing and that's well fine except you're going to notice something a little bit weird run back and forth when I stop I am NOT going back to idle am I I'm sort of staying in the running state and the reason for that is we could to switch to idle if velocity X is zero but slot to the X is slowly getting smaller and smaller but it is a floating point number and it's never going to be exactly zero so what we need to do is we need to set basically a minimum speed threshold to stop moving so if the velocity X is less than say 10 you make our velocity X equal to zero and that way that last little invisible bit of coasting that's happening it's going to make us stop so there's also the jump animations where we have a image for when the player is falling downwards and one for when they're jumping upwards but I'm gonna hold off on that I'm going to leave that for you to experiment with see if you can figure out how a good way to add those into animations here remember you can set the hint here is you can set loop to off here and you can actually set in the properties you can set what frame you want to be on so if it's not playing you can say use frame zero use frame 1 and then that might help you figure out how to choose between the up and the jumping up in the falling images what I'm going to do is make the platform's look a little better so in our art folder we have a nice grass block here that we can use it's 64 by 64 image so our platform if we drag that in it's going to be all stretched and ugly right because we've scaled it so let's bring that back to one so that's that's our grass block but I don't really want it to just be this big I want to be able to make it however wide I like and the way we're going to do that is by going into the texture and making sure you have repeat selected and you have met sweat then go back to your sprite and select region and now you'll see that the brightness sort of disappeared right that's because we need to tell it what the region rectangle is all right well we know the height is 64 because that's how big our kyle is but we wanted to be wider let's say I want to do 10 tiles live let's just type 10 times 64 there you go now you have a 640 wide tile and it just repeats let's turn off the glue actually you just repeat to the tile over and over again that many times so it's super handy and then we just need to make sure our collision matches that collision shape matches the size the tool too small we're running 32 before will increase that and now our platforms are going to look much nicer to run around on and finally let's just make the background look about it a little bit better that sounds great simple we've got a fixture here for that and on the main you're just going to add a sprite to hold it and we're going to put that first because you want it to be find everything else drop that in the texture and there we go this is a really big image so when you drag it around it's going to take up a lot of space so we can scale it as well all right if you want it a little bit smaller like the screen size put it like that and then you can do the same thing by the way with the backgrounds with the region and if you want it to repeat and have a if you have a scrolling background you just want to have a repeat over over again but that's something we will get to in a later video well there we go with a nice background find our platforms okay thanks for watching as always please like and
