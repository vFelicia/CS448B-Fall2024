welcome back to the Dell 101 this is part 14 and in this lesson we're going to introduce the next of the physics bodies in the Godot engine the rigidbody 2d so I've started out here by making a simple scene using a rigidbody 2d which I've named crate and attached to it I have a sprite and a collision shape which I'm using this little crate image so it will look like something interesting and I'm just using a simple rectangle collision shape so to start with let's look at all the properties that we have with the rigidbody 2d now the first one here is mode and by default that's going to be set to rigid there are some other options here if you choose static you can have your rigidbody 2d behave like it was a static body meaning it won't move anymore you can have it behave like it was a kinematic body where you will have to use code to move it like when you use a kinematic body 2d you can also set it to character mode which means it's going to behave like a rigid body but it won't be able to rotate so you can move it around like it's character running around on the screen but it won't spin when it hits something that would make it spin so we're going to leave that rigid for right now and then there's a whole bunch of physical properties like mass and friction and gravity and we'll talk about what those things are a little bit later in the video but you'll see if we just run this scene if we've created the crate it's going to just fall like it's responding to gravity and that comes from this gravity scale setting right here if I increase that to a higher number which you will see it's going to fall a little bit faster so now that's not very exciting so I've created a quick little main scene here where I've just taken three static bodies and just laid them out here to be some walls that our object can collide with and then I'm going to put a instance of that crate here and don't want to resize it put an incidence of that crate here into our scene so now you can see when we play it the crate will fall and it will hit that static body and slide along it in a very realistic fashion now all of these physical properties will apply to how the object behaves when it interacts with the environment if we gave the shape a little bit less friction right if I set the friction to 0.5 then you're going to see when it hits the wall it's going to slide along it some right and before it comes to rest like the wall is a little more slippery you can go as low as zero and say you want no friction between the two objects in which case it's going to slide very freely but it doesn't bounce very much and the bounce is a separate value all right we can set that to something and see that the object will bounce now when it hits and slide like it has no friction so you can do all of this notice we haven't written any code so the rigidbody 2d is using godot's builtin physics engine to do all the calculations for how this objects should behave based on its collision shape and the properties that you've set and I'm going to set these back for a moment and so you can get some pretty complex behavior right out of the box just by using these properties so I'm going to duplicate this create a couple of times and make a little stack here so that we can see you know when we run the scene these crates will just fall and stay on top of each other and so if we have if we were to have a another crate over here and I'm going to give this create some starting velocity see here we can set a linear or an angular velocity so we can give it a starting speed and we can give it a rotational speed well I'm going to set the starting velocity to minus 500 in the X so it's going to be traveling to the left so when I hit play this crate is going to be flying to the left alright and you can see it bounces off those crates and falls to the ground now if this create were to have a larger mass like let's multiply that mass by 10 and I were to do the same thing then now because that create wave so much more than the other ones it pushes them all aside and so you could play around with that and get all sorts of physics style behavior you know you can imagine making an Angry Birds type game that kind of thing very easily by combining these rigid bodies in in the way you want now when you do want to add additional behavior or control to a rigid body there are a whole bunch of methods that you get to be able to do that with but something you have to keep in mind with the rigid body is because it is part of the full physics simulation you can't just change the nodes location or change its velocity directly you have to apply forces to it right gravity is a force that's acting on it right now and you can add additional forces using the add force method there is also an apply impulse method which is kind of like giving it a kick right adding a force is going to be a steady force applying to the object an impulse is going to be an instantaneous force like you hit it with a stick or you pushed it and that's how you're going to make the object move so let's look at an example of that so we've got our crate and we're going to add a script okay and in this script in the in the ready function I'm just going to add a force and when you add a force you have two parameters the offset which is how far from the center you want the force applied so if you want it directly in the center you can leave that zero and then the second one is what the foot force you want alright let's put my foot zero minus 500 so what we're going to do is have this when this body starts it's going to have a an upward force being applied to it and of course what that's going to do is that's going to just barely counteract gravity so gravity is pulling down but I have a force pushing up which is cancelling it out so because we used add force this force is applied to the object permanently it will continually apply to the object until we choose to remove it by adding an equal and opposite force to cancel it out so you can apply lots of different forces and they will be the vectors will all be added together and you will have a resulting force that will be applied to the body now the other option that you have instead of that is an impulse which is an instantaneous kick so let's let's set input to true and then we're going to say if event dot is action pressed we're going to use UI select that's the spacebar now if the spacebar happens we're going to apply an impulse now when you apply an impulse you have the same options you have an offset which let's do it a little bit offset from the center and then you have a magnitude how much force do you want to apply so we'll do the same thing again we'll do that minus 500 upwards force so now whenever I press the spacebar this is going to be applied an instantaneous force is going to be applied to the object so we let it fall to the ground and then when we hit spacebar there you see and it rotated because the force was applied offset from the center so it's like I kicked it right here and every time I hit the spacebar that impulse is going to be applied so as another simple example let's change this event to mouse click and what we're going to do is whenever the mouse is clicked we want to get what direction the mouse pointer is in so the direction is going to be you need to get the global mouse position subtract the body's position and normalize it then now we have a direction vector pointing in the direction of where the mouse was clicked and we're going to apply an impulse like we did before and we're going to use that direction vector x say 800 so now go back over to our crate and let's set the gravity to zero so we won't be falling the crate will just hang there in space we're in zero gravity but if I click the mouse the crate is going to move in that direction and you can see because there's no gravity it's going to just keep going in whatever direction after it hits something and so something else that we can do is we can set this damping damping is lets you simulate basically a more viscous material like maybe the area maybe you're underwater instead of in the air and so this is how quickly the linear or angular velocity will be damped how quickly it will bleed away so if we do that now you'll see when I hit the click it does slowly come to a stop because it's more like it's under there's some sort of friction as it moves so that's a simple first look at the rigidbody2d and how to work with it in the next video we'll talk a little bit more about how to work with forces and control the rigidbody to get it to do what you wanted to do in your scene thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
