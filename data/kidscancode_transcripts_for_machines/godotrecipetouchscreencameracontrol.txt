welcome to another recipe in this video we're gonna look at how to make a touch screen controlled camera with pan and zoom features alright let's get started okay start here I've got a little topdown 2d game that I want to put on mobile and you know my player can walk around and I can see all the map but I want to have some control of the camera on mobile I want to be able to pan the camera around by dragging my finger on the screen and I want to be able to pinch and zoom the camera in and out all right we're gonna start with a new scene with a camera 2d which I'm going to call touch screen camera and let's go ahead and save that so this is gonna extend the camera so we're gonna add a script to it it extends camera to T's we're basically taking the camera to D and adding some additional functionality to it okay we're gonna add a just follow a little bigger we're gonna add a node path variable so that we can set the target that's the thing that the camera is going to be following and then we have a few variables that we need to set for how we want the speed that we wanted to move and things like that so there's a couple things when we drag the camera we want it to return to the target all right if I pan over to the side a lot and when I let go the screen I want it to pan back to the player and stay centered on them so target return enabled we're gonna set that to true and we can set that to false if we don't want that to happen if we want to force the player to drag the camera themselves if they want to go back to where the player is target return rate is how fast it's gonna do that and we're gonna do that relatively slow so we can see the effect we're gonna have a min and a max zoom level that we can go to and this will depend on your particular scale and how much of the map you want to the player to be able to see it once and that's supposed to be Max and we're also going to have a speed that's how fast the zoom will happen and oh and then the last one is we need to zoom sensitivity that's gonna be how sensitive the zoom is to your pinch gestures how much do you need to move your finger to make it zoom all right and then we're gonna need a couple variables events is gonna be a dictionary that keeps track of the touch events that happen in the input system and finally last drag distance is gonna be a variable to keep track of as we're doing the pinching how much we moved the two pinch points the two touch points to each other all right in the process function we're going to move the camera towards the target if target return is enabled so if there's a target and target return enabled is true and event size equals zero that means there's no drag events happening so all those things are true then we're going to take our cameras position and we're gonna alert it back to the target to the targets position at the target return rate all right now we can start programming the gestures and we're going to start with the pan gesture so we're gonna capture this in unhandled input and if the event is an input event screen touch that's what we're looking for then either it's going to be pressed meaning we started a touch or it's going to be released which means we let go so if it's pressed that means we started a new event so in the events we're going to use the event index as the key and we're going to store the event in that dictionary we're doing this because there can be multiple events at once right when you're doing a pinch there's two touches happening at the same time and if we got a event that wasn't pressed then we need to do the opposite and we need to erase the event index out of that dictionary okay so that detected a touch but now we need to detect if it was a drag so if we get a screen drag event then we're gonna also put that into the into the dictionary and note that if the index was the same meaning if we just did one touch it's gonna be index zero and then we start dragging that same touch index zero is gonna get updated to be that new event if event size is one so if we only have one event when we have a drag that means we're doing a single finger drag so we're gonna update the position of the camera and we'll use event are relative to get the direction we moved in and we'll multiply it by our zoom level which right now is one so we're multiplying by one but as we zoom in or out we're gonna want to change the speed of our drag okay so let's take a look at what that looks like so I've added a couple of debug draw commands here so that we can see this is just displaying the size of that events dictionary and the zoom level of the camera and then when I detect a touch event I'm going to draw a circle there so now we can see if this was our finger we can drag it and the camera will pan around wherever we go and when we let go it will slowly come back to the target at that return rate speed and so we've made it a little since we're doing lerp there it will go fast when it's far away and then gradually slow down as it gets back to the player so that's working pretty good and as you can see we can test it on the PC with our mouse but unfortunately to test the pinch and zoom we need to touch events and we can't emulate that with the mouse so we are going to have to test on the phone alright so fortunately I have an Android device which means it's as easy for me as pressing the Android deploy button here to launch the application on my device which I have capturing in an app here so now we can see the app here and I'm going to go and I'm going to touch the screen on my phone and you can see the pan is still working and now if we want to do the zoom I'm going to see the two touch events occur and then as I pinch in and out you see the camera zooming so that is all working like we want and see how the pan speed is affected by the zoom level so that we don't pan too fast when we're zoomed in and too slow when we're zoomed out so that's it a fairly basic starter drag camera that you can add to your mobile apps some ways you could extend this you could return the zoom to the original level after zooming you could use a double tap to reset all of the camera settings to zoom back out on a double tap you can add more gestures right if event size is 3 then you have a three finger drag happening and you could do another behavior when that occurs all right thanks for
