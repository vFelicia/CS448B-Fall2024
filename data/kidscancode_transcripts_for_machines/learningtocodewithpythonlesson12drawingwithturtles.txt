welcome to learning to code with python I'm Chris Bradfield and I'll be your instructor for this series these videos are intended for students ages 11 to 14 or about grades 5 to8 if you're younger than that you can still give it a try but you might want to get help from an adult we're going to be doing a lot of typing before we get started make sure you've already installed python on your computer if you haven't stop the video now and click on the link below for instructions you will probably need to get your parents help for that part if you have any questions about this lesson or any other lessons click on asking for help under the video that's the best way if you leave a comment on YouTube I might not see it or you might not see my answer today we're going to talk about turtles and when I say turtle I don't mean the cute little animal with the shell I'm actually talking about a robot in the early days of computing some scientists created a robot that looked kind of like the one in this picture and they called it Turtle because of its shape the purpose of this robot was to draw and so it had a pen attached to it the way it worked was you would put a large piece of paper on the ground and as the turtle drove around it would leave a trail by giving it different commands you could create all kinds of shapes and designs and that's what we're going to do today only instead of using a robot and paper we're going to use the computer so let's open up our python shell like we learned to do in our first video to make our Turtle appear we'll need to type two commands the first one is import Turtle now you're going to see the import command quite a bit as You Learn Python import tells the computer what kind of commands you're going to need for your program in this case we want it to load or import the commands for working with Turtle Graphics now that we've imported the turtle commands let's make a turtle here's the command for that now I'm naming my turtle Fred you can use a different name later but let's just stick with Fred for now also do you notice that capital P that's important if you type a lowercase p things will not work correctly so now we have our Turtle window let's arrange these two windows next to each other we'll be typing over here in the shell and seeing what the turtle does over here now I know what you're thinking that doesn't look like a turtle it's just an arrow well I agree I'd also like my turtle to look like a turtle so let's do that first we're going to tell Fred to change his shape there we go that's better this is what most of our Turtle commands are going to look like the name of the turtle Fred a DOT and then what command we want it to do so now we're ready to draw let's see what Fred can do first let's tell him to move forward fred. forward 100 now before I press enter I'd like you to think about what that 100 stands for do you think it means inches centimeters no Fred exists inside the computer he doesn't know what inches or centimeters are Fred measures everything in pixels if you were to look really really closely at your computer screen you'd see it's made up of lots and lots of tiny little dots those little dots are called pixels depending on your screen they may be really hard to see so let's see Fred move so we told Fred to go forward 100 pixels and he left a trail behind him now let's tell him to turn left and the argument remember that's the stuff that's inside the parenthesis the argument for left is not in pixels it's in degrees a full circle is 360Â° so telling him to turn 90 means he's now pointing up on the screen if we tell him to go forward again then that's the direction he moves in so let's try repeating those commands a few more times there we've made a square so let's try a few more commands and by the way this might be a good time to pause and practice these commands before you go on with the video all right let's try a few more commands fred. reset is useful basically tells Fred to erase everything he's drawn go back to the medal and start over again at the beginning so let's tell Fred to change his color the color command lets you type the name of a color and Fred will change to that color if we try to move now we're drawing in that color feel free to pick a different color other than red Fred knows quite a lot of them if you want to see the full list and it's a big one there's a link below the video to a website where you can see all the colors that Fred knows how to do feel free to pause and go take a look at it another command that we're going to try out is circle the circle takes as an argument the number for how big we want the circle to be in our case here we want the circle to have a radius of 100 radius means the distance from the center to the edge so our Circle will look like that we can also put a minus into the circle arguments what do you think that'll do well let's see it drew a circle the same size but started going in the opposite direction let's go ahead and reset and let's try another color let's do blue this time now sometimes when you're drawing you want to draw shapes that aren't connected to each other so for example if we went forward and then I wanted to draw a circle that wasn't attached to this line what would I do well that's where the command up comes in handy up tells Fred to pick his pen up so it's no longer touching the paper so that means now if we were to move forward oops we would move without leaving a line so we can move to where we want to go and then when we're ready to draw again we tell Fred to put the pen down and then if we draw there we go we've got shapes that aren't connected to each other now might be a good time to talk about what happens if we make a mistake now some of you have probably seen this already but what happens if I make a mistake and I spell the command wrong well I get a bunch of scary Red text that says I made an error you need to get used to the idea of looking at these error messages and trying to understand what they mean usually the most important part of the error is this last line down here at the bottom let's look what it says Turtle object has no attribute for wad well if I were to pay attention to what I'd been typing I'd realize well of course it gave an error message I spelled forward wrong so let's try it again and spell it right there we go get in the habit of trying to figure out what those error messages are telling you look very carefully at what you typed most of the time it's going to be a simple mistake because you spelled something wrong all right let's stop there and review everything we've learned so far to create our Turtle we needed to type these two commands in the red box if you quit the python shell and start it again you'll need to type these two commands to get your turtle window back we learned how to tell the turtle to move forward and remember the number in the parentheses the argument is in pixels we learned how to turn left and as you might imagine you can also turn right we learn to draw draw a circle we learn to change the color and don't forget the color name needs to have the quotes around it or it won't work right we learned how to pick up or put down the pen so that we're either drawing or moving without drawing and we learned about reset which wipes the window clean and lets Fred start over again with a whole new drawing and I'm going to leave this one bonus command here at the bottom and I'm not going to tell you what it does go ahead and try it out and see if you can find out for yourself all right go and make some drawings see what you can make try drawing a stick figure a snowman a house whatever you might want to try and I'll see you in the next lesson
