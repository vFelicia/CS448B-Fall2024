got a really quick one for you today about aligning the direction of an object's movement with the direction of the camera in a recent video i showed how to make a rolling cube that moves around in the four cardinal directions and i'm pressing w a s and d to move the problem is that when you rotate the camera right now i'm still pressing w but now forward for this cube is not the same as forward for the camera and if i turn the camera all the way around you know i've reversed everything and what we'd really like is for w to go forward this way and w to go forward this way and w to go right in whatever direction the camera is facing that's our forward and that's what we're going to do right now all right and you can look at the other video for the details of how the cube moves using this roll function but what matters right now is this part where we're getting the input and right now we've defined forward to be the global forward vector and then up and down move forward and the opposite and right and left are at 90 degree angles to that and so what we want to do is we want to change this to be relative to the camera so i'm going to add a node path export so that we can get the camera path let me just go over here and that lets us assign the camera wherever it is in the scene and then what we could do and this is not quite going to be the solution but we could try and say something like this right if there's a camera then use the cameras forward as our new forward but the problem with that is going to be of course that the camera can rotate to any angle not just 90 degrees so while this works and if i rotate over to here that works the camera's at an angle now my cube is starting to do some weird things because i can go in any direction and what i really want to do is snap that camera forward to the closest 90 degree angle okay so instead of assigning the forward to that what we're going to do is we're going to assign it to zero to begin with so we have all three axes set to zero and then we're going to get what the camera's forward is so so the camera forward is going to be that value that we were just getting right and i want to find which axis it's mostly pointing along is it mostly pointing along the zaxis is it mostly pointing along the xaxis positive or negative that kind of thing and we can do that by using first dot abs to just get rid of the positive and negatives and then doing max axis and that's going to get whichever axis of the forward vector is the largest and so that's going to give us since our camera rotates around the y axis it's going to be pointing along x and z so it's going to get us the x or z axis and then we can set our forward max cam axis so whichever axis that was in our camera that's the one we want to use for our forward and we'll set that equal to the sine of the cam forward cam axis okay so now what we've done is we figured out which direction is the closest x or z that the camera's pointing in and we've set our forward to that and if we run this now i've added a little uh print debug print up here at the top so you can see right now the camera forward is along the negative z axis which is what we expect now if i rotate this a little bit notice that hasn't changed i'm still going to go forward but if i rotate far enough now you can see it's snapped to negative x and now i'm still pressing w i'm only going to press w and we rotate far enough this way w will now point that way w points this way right so so now we can just by turning the camera change which direction is our forward and that's going to keep you from getting disoriented as you move the camera around all right and that's it i hope that was a helpful tip for you that max axis function of vector 3 is quite a useful one thanks for watching i'll see you in the next video
