hey welcome back to game development PI game this is part 13 of our shmups game series and we're continuing to work on our powerups the last time we added some powerups that would randomly drop from the mobs when we shoot them and we have the shield powerup adding back to our shield when we pick it up but the gun powerup the little lightning bolt doesn't do anything right now so we're gonna fix that so if we look at the game right now when we shoot we're shooting a single bullet so there's a lot of different things we could do with the powerup but one of them could be that when we pick it up we've switched to firing bullets one out of each of the little wing tips so we need to spawn two bullets when we get a gun powerup so I'm just gonna put here that when we pick up the gun powerup we're just gonna do a player dot powerup and then we'll be able to define that to be whatever we want it to be and that'll make it easy for us to customize it change it later if we want so we're gonna go up to the player so here's my player and we're gonna need to define that powerup now what does that mean well we're gonna need a couple of variables as well because I want my power level so we're gonna have a self dot power and that power level is going to start out being level one that's where we started shooting the one bullet when we pick up the powerup it can add one to that and we go up to power level two which means we're gonna shoot two bullets so that's this is what's going to determine what power level we're on we're also gonna have a power timer so that we can keep track of when we picked up the powerup so that we can drop back down to level one when the power when the powerup runs out so it's just a little timer on the powerup okay so we have those two and then we're gonna go down here I'm going to do it in your shoot because it's going to be related so we're gonna define power up and what power up is going to do is it's going to add 1 to the power level and it's going to set the power time we're gonna get tix and we're gonna set them so we're gonna set the power time so we know what time we powered up and now we just need to go to our shoot here and instead of instead of doing just one bullet we're going to do one bullet if we're on power level 1 and we're going to do two bullets if we're on power level 2 so this would be if self dot power equals 1 alright we would do that stuff but if power level is 2 then we're gonna spawn 2 bullets okay now that means we want to set 2 different bullets at two different locations so bullet and here we'll just copy and paste this and you're gonna see this is gonna be a little bit repetitive and we're gonna clean that up later so don't worry about it right now but so we want to take this bullet right and we want to spawn two of them one of them is going to be at the left of our player spray and one of them is going to be at the right of the player sprite and then where is it gonna spawn we need to spawn it a little lower and turns out if we spawn it at the center Y then it'll look like it's about the right spot and you'll see when we you'll see when we do it how that works so we're gonna have to add both of these so we're gonna add bullet one and bullet two to the appropriate groups okay so now for an entire level one we're going to do this we run parallel to we're going to do this now currently if we are on power level two and another lightning bolt drops we're gonna add one to it so we'd be on power level three we don't really define anything for that and it's up to us to decide whether we want to keep going up with that so I'm gonna just put here greater than or equal to so that way we don't have a power level that's not defined because otherwise we wouldn't be shooting at all if we were on towel three so this way we can just sort of stick to two for now okay so the only other thing we have to do is in our update we just need to check if it's time to drop back down because the timer has run out okay so in the update I'm going to do this time out for powerups okay we're just gonna say if our power level is greater than level one that's when we care about dropping down right and we get what we get what time it is if that the self dot power time right the less so however long it's been since the last time we or since we picked up the powerup I should say is greater than some power power uptime variable that we're gonna configure then your power level should drop by one and your power time can reset that way later on if we decide to have three power levels or four or whatever if you're on power level three and it's been that certain amount of time then you're gonna drop down to parallel to and you'll stick it to our level two for a while or for however long that time is okay so we need to define that up here our power our power time let's set that to five seconds so five thousand milliseconds for now okay now let's take a look and see what we see we just need to get a lightning bolt to drop there it is okay so now I'm shooting two bullets at a time and now if we wait for five seconds to go by we should see it drop that to there being one bullet there we go drop back okay so a couple other things to do and one I said I was gonna take the power up and speed them up and maybe I'm gonna put that at O let's try four or maybe even five I just want them to fall a bit faster they were going way too slow and then we also don't have currently a any kind of sound associated with picking up the power ups and that's a little boring you'd be a little more interesting if we could hear a little sound so I'm going to also add some sounds so I added a couple of sounds one for each of the powerups so I'm gonna go to this section here where we're loading all of our game sounds and we need to load a couple more so I'm just gonna quickly duplicate that and we're gonna call this the shield sound and then we're also going to have the the power sound okay and this one is called POW for dot wave and this one is called v dot wave okay so we just want to play those whenever either those events happen right and so the shield powerup happens when we pick up the shield so we can just right here we power up the shield we play the shield sound when we power up the player we're gonna play the power sound oops power sound play okay let's try that out real quick and see how that sounds good there we go okay okay that's about it for basic power ups obviously there's a lot more things we could do with them the gun powerup could increase your fire speed as well as how many bullet two you do we could have a level three a little four we could even even have different types of gun power ups that do different things and combine in different ways you can get as complex as you want to get with it we could also have other powerups that give us some lives back since we can lose lives now we could also have something that gives us lives back basically there's a lot of different things we could do and if we think about our game right now we've reached you know about 350 lines of code and we have a lot of features going on there's a lot of things going on you scroll through here there's a lot of code there's a lot of things to keep track of and remember where they are so this is kind of a point you reach in most projects where it's starting to get complex and as you add more things it starts to get complicated to keep track of of everything that's going on and so in our next video we're gonna talk about kind of what should we do at this point to deal with the complexity issue and how can we keep this from getting out of control if we keep adding more things to it all right now I'll see you next time you
