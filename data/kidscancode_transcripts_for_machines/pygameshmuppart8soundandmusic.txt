welcome back to game development with pygame this is part 8 of our mop game and in this video we're going to learn how to add sound effects and music so if we want to add sounds to our game we need to find some sounds that we would like to use there's all sorts of ways to get sounds open game art is a great place for all sorts of different sound effects just like it is for art but what I'm going to show you today is this website called bfx are.net now this is a really awesome tool for generating your own sound effects it looks a little scary at first don't worry about all these sliders and things because we don't really need to do much with them or we can play around with them later but what we can do is with these buttons over here by clicking them you'll generate a random sound of that type so for example this shoot one every time I click it it's gonna get another random shooting kind of sound so like this first one that I did see how it lists them down here so it just keeps adding to this list so you can go back and find the ones I made so if you don't like one you can get rid of it if you like one you can keep it here in your in your list to use later you can even change its name here okay and so clicking over here you can play it again and all these little sliders are just different ways to modify that sound you know maybe the frequency you want it higher pixel now it's higher pitched or you want it lower pitched that's too low you know and you can play around with all sorts of different settings do you get it the way you like it we are going to need a shooting sound for our ship when it shoots its laser and we're also going to need an explosion kind of sound for when the meteor gets blown up so as you hear there's also two different kinds of explosions you can get and this can be endless fun you can play around to this for a long time when you have found a sound you like that you want to keep like so for example this laser you just click on export wave don't click on save to disk it's not going to save it in the right file format for pygame to be able to use but if we do export WAV WAV is a file format a way of saving the file that pygame will be able to read so you just click on export wave and save it however you like with whatever name you like don't forget the name because you're gonna need to use that name to load it into your game so I've done that and I have created in my folder just like we created the IMG folder to hold the images I've created an snd folder to hold the sound and I've put in there two different explosion sounds I found two that I liked that one and that one which is a little deeper and I'm gonna have just to have a little variety every time I meteor blows up it's going to randomly pick one of these sounds okay and then I also have a pew pew sound for shooting my gun that's nice and short and then I have this this is something different this is music so this is a some background music that I want to play be playing in the background of my game and I got this song off of open game art and you can find the link below if you look for it or if you want to use a different piece of music you'll be able to do that as well now we can start working on the code to get the sound working and the first thing I wanted to discuss was if you go over to the open game art page for this piece of music this is the one that I had downloaded the artist has placed in the description here something called attribution instructions and that means he's asking that in exchange for using his music for free that you follow these instructions which are he would like this little bit of text saying that he's the one who made it to be placed somewhere in your game so I'm gonna just copy that and paste it up here at the top as he asked now for the art we used Kenny didn't actually doesn't actually require you to do anything he actually says you can do whatever you want with my art it doesn't hurt though to be friendly and put that it's from Kenny and I'm gonna go ahead and put that there since we're doing attributions right now okay so now we need to add a little bit to use our sound folder just like we did with the image folder we're gonna just figure out the path to that so we'll be able to reference or look up those files that are in that SMD folder so let's start by going down to our here where we're loading all the game graphics well we also need to load all the game sounds okay oh and by the way remember if you remember back when we first made this template we put PI game mixer dot init in here this is the thing that starts the sound sound system if you don't have this line then you will not be able to play sound so we put that in ahead of time if you don't have that make sure you add that back in right after PI game dot in it okay so we're gonna load our game sounds now we want to do that by using the same basically that's the same kind of process as when you load graphics there's a command to load that graphics or that sound file and then there's going to be a command to play that sound file whenever we so for example for a pew pew sound our oops our shoot our shoot sound okay that's gonna be PI game dot mixer dot sound with a capital S and then you just put what file you want to look at so we're gonna say path that join sound snd comma and I called my in peww a V so you can put whatever the file name of your sound you want is and that's our shoot sound and if we go up to our player in our def shoot is when we spawn a bullet so if we want to make play the sound whenever we spawn a bullet then we're just gonna say shoot sound dot play as simple as that let's give it a try now I've got some nice few sounds whenever I shoot now that we know that works we can add our explosion sounds and for the explosions remember I had two different explosion sounds that I wanted to use so I'm gonna make a list called explosion sounds that's going to hold all of them and then I'm just going to say for I'm just going to do a list of both of these the xpl 3 wav and expl expl 6 WAV or what those happen to be named okay so for each of those I'm just going to load them and stick them into that list so dot append and what I'm appending is pygame mixer dot sound path join each of these things so then I'll have a list of just both of those and then I have so then I have that explosion sound so now up here or sorry down here when we actually destroy a mob when we destroy the mob we want to play a random sound out of that list so we can just say random dot choice expl sounds make a random choice of the explosion sounds and play it and that should let us see or sorry hear that's gonna work really well when we have explosions and not just disappearing meteors last but not least we need our background music I'm just gonna add a whole lot of personality to the game and we do that by it's slightly different than the way sounds work because this is music that we want playing continuously in the background so we say mixer music load and then we have to say what what file we want so path join sound sound folder and then the file name which happens to be kind of long if you recall so I'm just going to copy and paste that in there that's the name of the file now it just so happens that when I first tried this sound out the music was pretty loud and it was a lot louder than the sound of the other sound effects so I'm gonna take the music and also do a command called set dot music set volume and lets us set the volume to a lower level so I'm going to set it to point four so I wanted to be background music and I want to be able to hear it but I don't want it to be louder than everything else in the game later on when we have a menu we can have the players can choose what setting they want and then we'll be able to change it there so now we've loaded the music we want to start playing it we want to start playing it right before the game loop starts so we could put that right here right before the game loop starts and just say PI game mixer music dot play and then the parentheses you can set things like whether you want if you add for example a playlist you wanted to play one time then play a different song whether you want it to loop and how many times you want it to loop and so on I'm gonna say we want to put loops equal negative one and that is an option that that tells PI game to loop it every time it reaches the end of the of the music it's going to loop around to the start again and it's just going to keep doing that over and over again so however long we play the music will continue to loop okay and now you should have some nice you you
