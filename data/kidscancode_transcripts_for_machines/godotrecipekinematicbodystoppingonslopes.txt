in this video we're going to tackle kinematic body and sliding on slopes okay so we've got an ordinary kinematic body here with pretty generic movement we had jumping and controls and we're using move and slide to do the movement and everything is fine but of course when we go on a slope we're going to see that we slide down and this is actually move and slide doing what it's supposed to do right our downward velocity that gravity is pulling us straight downwards is being slid along the surface and that's what movement slide is supposed to do so if we look at the kinematic body documentation we'll see the movement slide has a parameter called stop on slope that's false by default so let's go ahead and change that to true so instead of just doing move and slide with our velocity and our up vector we're going to do our velocity our up vector and then we're going to set stop on slope to true so what does that look like now when i go on the slope no sliding and you can see i'll go over here on the steeper one right we're not sliding on the slope at all uh we can still jump fine on the slope however if we do go to a really steep slope like this we're going to slide down and we'll talk about that more in a minute but you can see we're already pretty much getting what we want but there is a small problem which is really hard to see in this example because my gravity is kind of high which i wanted for good jumping but let's let's make the gravity really low just so you can see this problem a little bit better so with a really low gravity when i run up this slope you're going to see a little hop let me see that so when i stop moving or when i stop my input my velocity vector is being slid along the slope right so it has a forward component and an upward component and the forward component stops but there's still some upward momentum and that gets translated into this little bounce and looks a little odd you also get a little bit of a jump when you go off the slope and we don't want that either so what we're going to do to fix that is we're going to switch to move and slide with snap and so we're going to get our snap vector and it's just going to be pointing straight down now because i have jumping if we always had a downward snap vector then we'd never be able to jump because we'd be snapped to the ground no matter what so if we're not jumping we're going to be snapped to the ground but for jumping we're going to have a zero snap vector so move and slide with snap we have our velocity our snap vector our up vector and again stop on slope is true and you'll see that will get rid of the little jump that we are having right no more little jump when i stop moving okay so now everything is pretty good although my gravity is super low now uh so now everything is pretty good but you'll see we still of course have the problem over here we've got it definitely jumps and it slides and this slope is not working right why is that well the reason for that is that move and slide with snap is not considering this to be a slope because the default value for max floor angle is 45 degrees and so that means consider anything that's 45 degrees or less to be ground and you should stand on it anything above that should be considered a wall so this is considered a sloped wall not the ground so it's not being snapped to so what we want to do is to fix that if you want to have really steep slopes is change your move and slide with snap to also include floor max angle and see i've made it 52 degrees because that's the angle of the slope that i made for this example and now this steep slope acts just the way we want it and i can still jump on it and all that kind of stuff okay so hopefully this helps you out with some of your problems you're having with kinematic bodies in 3d post below if you have any questions and i'll see you in a future video
