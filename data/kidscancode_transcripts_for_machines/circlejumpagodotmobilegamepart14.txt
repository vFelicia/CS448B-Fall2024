welcome to part 14 a circle jump this time around we're gonna spend some time fixing a couple of things that have gotten broken in previous steps and we're gonna start working on adding a little polish that we want to improve the quality of life a little bit before we call this game ready to release all right let's get started the first thing we're gonna need to do is fix a couple of things that I broke last time when we added the bonus feature a couple of things that changed were on the circle we are counting the number of orbits differently now and so the limited circles just stopped working because right here if current orbits is less than zero well current orbits is counting how many times we've gone around we're gonna lose if it's greater than or equal to no more bits another thing we broke was on main when we were doing the level counting right we would go up a level that was based on score but now our score is jumping super high because of the bonus so our level can't be based on comparing our score to the number of circles per level we need to count how many circles we're touching as well as the score so we're going to add another variable here for that so enum circles and then down here when we when we start a new level we need to set enum circles to 0 and then whenever we get some points here we're also going to when we get captured we're gonna increase num circles and then this is where we're going to compare for this level so I'm going to take this code I'm gonna move it from the set score function and put it here and this is going to be if numb circles is greater than 0 and numb circles compared with the settings then we'll go up a level show the level message on our HUD we have the problem that the animation player can't play the bonus animation for example right whether we flash the bonus and the message at the same time because they were on the same animation player at the show message and so I've split these up into multiple animations and this was really easy to do if you have an animation player like say this one and you wanted to copy this you can actually copy the animation go to another animation player in and choose paste and it'll shift right over there and so I've made a bonus a score in a message animation so that they can operate separately the score one is just I copied it from the bonus one so we can pulse the score when they get points but I also want to do something else where since you're getting bonus points now your score can be jumping from you know 50 to 75 or something like that and rather than just changing the number I want to show it rolling upwards and I want to see the numbers flickering as it rises to the new score so that's what we're going to add next and we're gonna do that with this tween node and so in the HUD script I'm adding a score variable this is to track what the current score is so we can interpolate it between the current value and the new value and so I've changed the update score so instead of just updating the text what we're going to do is we're going to interpolate that score property between what it is now and what the new value is coming in which means we have to pass in the current score and then the new value so that's over in our main we've got to update that whenever we call HUD update score we have to update with what the score is and what we're changing it to so we're gonna say score comma zero there because we're going from zero to zero basically but down here when we get points we're going to take that and we're gonna do it before we've set the new value and we'll pass both like that so now back on our head script we are interpreting those two values start this start the tween and then we'll play that score animation where we flash the red and the size increase but then we've also connected the between step signal which goes off every step that between travels and that's going to pass in that value that it's on and so we're gonna set the score text to that value and then we'll see all the intermediate values between the points when we score which is especially when we are operating with a high bonus gonna be a lot so let's try it out here we got to get a few jumps going before we get some points but you can see the ticker going up there when it's adding points to me okay so that's gonna do it for this relatively short part it's just a little bit more polish that we're putting on as we get closer to being finished and ready to release this app out to the wild I hope you're enjoying it and I'll see you in the next video this tutorial is part of my nugudo recipes website the goal is to collect all the best tips and lessons to help make you a better at Godot developer if you like this video I hope you'll go and check out the site and make sure to hit subscribe so you'll be notified whenever I release new videos thanks for watching
