hi everyone this is a quick video about text editors and which ones work well with Python and PI games specifically so we've been using idle up till now if you've been going through the beginner series and idle is nice because it comes with Python and it's there when you install it but it's not very good for when you get a little bit more advanced so we're going to leave Python idle behind and we're going to use something called atom there's lots of different text editors out there and if you have a favorite one already that you'd rather use that's fine I like atom it works pretty well and it's available for whatever kind of computer you might have so the website is a DeMayo and you're just going to click the red download button and it'll download the right one for your type of computer ok when you finish downloading atom and you launch it for the first time it's going to look like this so it's almost ready to go but there's a couple of things we need to do in the settings just to get everything working perfectly for programming in Python so I'm going to go ahead and close these welcome screens and then I'm going to choose preferences if you're on Windows the Preferences is under the file menu but the Mac it's under atom we open preferences now there's lots of options and most of them we don't have to mess with but I'm going to scroll down to show indent guide ok that's going to be really helpful when you're making sure you indent things properly in python and you want to make sure soft tabs is checked it should be and we want to set our tab length to 4 because that's the correct amount for python all right a couple other things if we click over here on packages wait a second there's lots of packages that are already installed basically for different functions different programming languages you might be using the specific one we want to turn on is autosave and if we click on settings we can we're going to click enabled right here that way our programs will get automatically saved three time we click away or close it you can't forget to save it okay and one more thing to do and we need to click on install and here we're going to install a package to help us run our Python programs so if you type in Adam runner search then it's going to go and find it there it is Adam Runner so just click install alright we click on packages Adam runners installed now if you're on Windows you are finished if you're on the Mac there's one more thing we need to do if you follow the directions for installing Python and PI game and the link is below if you haven't done that yet you're going to need to do one more thing so if we go up here to open your config we're going to have to add a little something here looks like this we have to say for Adam are sorry for runner ok for runner we need to do Python and we need to tell it to use user local bin Python 3 if you don't do this it'll try to use the default version of Python which is an old one that comes with OS 10 and will not work with PI game so if you do that make sure we save it and you should be good to go now that step was for Mac only now let's just make sure it works we can type in a quick little program make my font size a little bigger here we'll just print out a couple of quick random numbers okay save that need to make sure to put py at the end py tells the computer and Adam that this is a Python file and you'll know that it knows it's a Python file when it highlights everything in color properly okay now to run it you're just going to type ctrl R or on the windows you're going to type alt are either way you'll see the program run it runs over here if I if I type ctrl R again every time I type it it runs all right and we are done if you want to you can go and play around over in the settings with the themes there's all sorts of different colors you can use different styles you can play around with that if you like I tend to like the tomorrow and the one dark is what I'm going to be using but you can use whatever you want alright and we're ready to go start learning to use PI game so I'll see you in that video series
