welcome back to the topdown tank battle Godot engine game series today we're gonna start working on some of the UI for our game starting with the title screen I'm gonna make a new scene here and I'm gonna start it with a control node this is going to be my title screen root node I'm gonna save this in my UI folder and now we need to just set up our layout for our title screen I'm gonna make this full rect so the control node fills the whole screen and then I'm gonna start simple just with a couple of label nodes so let's put in a label this will be the title this is gonna contain the title which again keeping it simple I'm just gonna call this tank battle for now and I want to set the font on this now here's a quick tip to if you set the layout first like say you wanted it to be I don't know aligned on the right right and then you change the font you're gonna find that alignment doesn't work and I'll have to do the alignment again so go ahead and make sure you do the font first so I'm gonna load my font here from my assets folder and I'm gonna set the font size to let's see maybe 6 that's pretty good we'll stick with that for now now where do I want this to be I want this to be centered so I can do like that right set the text to be aligned Center and then I think I want it go on it up a bit so I'm just gonna hit the up arrow shift up arrow a couple times to jump it up a little bit so I want it slightly above center and then the second one here is going to be the call this play message this is the gonna be the one that says press space to play okay now this one I want the font to be a little smaller now since I duplicated they're sharing the same dynamic font so it's a good idea to click make unique here so that when I go in here and change the font size on this one to make it smaller it's not going to be the same so let's set this one to bottom wide and then do the same thing we'll bring it up a little bit and put it about there actually maybe even a slightly smaller font yeah okay so there's my simple starter layout for the text on the screen now I want some kind of background and since we already have our tile map set up I'm just gonna use the tile map and the tile set that we've already made to be my background that above the title and the play message so that it won't cover them up and then we need to load our tile set which is in our terrain section set the cell size to the right size and now I could you know fill this in now the only thing about this is I think for the title screen this is gonna be a little bit on the large side like what like when we have roads in there like for example so I was thinking maybe I will zoom this out a little bit or shrink it so I'm going to hit transform scale on the tile map and I'm going to set it to half the size yeah there we go and now we can just draw out the map we want fill this in okay and then draw maybe some roads going around and I'll skip over that part real quick okay so I just drew some quick roads winding around through here around the labels and I'm thinking that the brightness of this of these background todd's is a little too high for the contrast with the orea kind of washes out the text so I'm gonna take the tile map and I'm gonna put its modulate I'm gonna put its modulate I'm gonna put it to modulate down a little bit say round there yeah just make it a little darker and then on the these two labels I'm going to set some shadow offset let's see let's try five and five and then under the color is the font color shadow there we go and it might be a little too much yeah I just want a little bit of drop shadow underneath there to make the letters pop let's hit play here okay so that's what our that's what our title screen is gonna look like and now I'm going to add an animation player here so that I can animate these labels to make them pop a little bit more give a little bit of animation when we start the title screen let's make a new animation or they'll call it start I'm gonna set it to auto play and then I'm going to animate two things first I'm going to take the title and I'm gonna go to it's wrecked position and I'm gonna keyframe that that's actually where I wanted to end so I'm going to put that out over say here around the halfway point maybe a little closer not quite sure how fast I want this to be yet and then I'm also and then I'm just going to move it up again using the shift up arrow just move it straight up that's where I want it to start let's just keyframe that and so now the animation will drop that in and then the other thing that I want to animate is this press space to play I don't want that to appear yet at the beginning so the play message visibility is gonna be off keyframe that so it's going to start off we're gonna wait until after we have dropped in the title and we're gonna keep frame it again it's still off and then I'm going to step one more time and turn it on and then that way we get we hit play drops in and then press space to play appears and actually I think maybe we'll space this out a little bit more make it a little bit slower yeah I actually want to move this maybe there yeah perfect okay that's what I want okay now skipping ahead a little bit in time I've added a path to D and I drew a convoluted path kind of drives around through the roads goes off the screen and then comes on again because what I can do now is I can attach a path follow and an instance of the enemy tank and because the enemy tank which we need to scale down as well because remember we scaled the top down so but the enemy tank will automatically follow this path so now when we play our title screen the enemy tank is going to drive along this road and we can actually add we could add multiple tanks we could do a lot of different things but that gives us a little activity happening while we're watching our while we're looking at our title screen then just throw a few obstacles in there and we have a nicelooking starter title screen for us to work from again this will change over time it will add some more effects to it and in the next video we'll talk about how to do the transitions to and from the title screen to playing the game thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video you
