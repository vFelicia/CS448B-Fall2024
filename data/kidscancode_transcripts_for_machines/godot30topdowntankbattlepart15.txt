welcome back to the topdown tank battle tutorial game in this installment we're going to take our title screen we made in the last video and we're going to connect it up so that our game can and restart and transition between levels and this is part of kind of wrapping this game up I don't want this to become too complex a project because my goal was that it would be more of a starting point or a framework for everyone who's watching to get an idea of how to start building things but leave it generic enough that you can extend it yourself and add more and more things to it so I that's why I haven't done a lot of special effects on there I haven't made the tanks too complex with an upgrade path or different kinds of functionalities so hopefully that it's been helpful to you that way and perhaps in another future project we'll talk about how to do some of those additional extensions alright so let's get into the code so first we're going to add some code to our Global's script our autoload script that has data in it that's going to persist between screens so we're gonna make a variable called current level that's going to be keeping track of what level we're on in the game once we make multiple maps where you can transition from level to level we'll start on a little zero which is the title screen then I'm gonna make a list of levels and this is just gonna be a simple way to map what the order of the scenes is alright the first scene we want to go to is the title screen that's the first one and then when you leave the title screen you're gonna go to the first map so I'm going to throw that in there and then we would extend this array longer if we had a sequence of maps to go through so we're gonna add a function here called restart this is going to be called when we want to restart the game start everything all over again right we set current level zero and we're gonna change scene two whatever levels current level is and that's going to send us to levels zero which is the title screen but we also want to be able to transition so we're gonna make a next level function that's just going to increment our current level and if that is less enter levels dot size right we obviously can't advance to a level that doesn't exist then we're going to get tree change scene actually we're gonna just copy and paste this otherwise we're gonna just call restart so if we got to the end of the game we're just gonna go to the title screen and this is all we needed to do right now for our simple restart functionality you know more complex game you might have each map have a property called next level where the map tells you what its next level it goes to or potentially more than one if it has multiple exits things like that but that's a really just an extension of this and I want to keep it simple for for now alright so now we can go to the title screen scene and we're going to we need to capture pressing the spacebar so that they can start playing so we're going to add a script to the title screen and this script is going to just check for input we want action pressed UI select is the spacebar action then we're going to take Global's and call next level and that's it now we could actually check this if we play let's select the title screen as our main scene and when I press space it goes into the main level now we need to do something when the player dies all right because when the player dies we want the game to end so we have on the player if I open up the map scene here we have on the player its signals we have a dead signal and we're calling on player dead were reloading the current scene and instead we could call our restart function that we made in Global's so now let's check this out when I die and get in front of the missiles when I die I'm back to the title screen and I can play again ok so now we have our basic functionality for our title screen working and our game restart you
