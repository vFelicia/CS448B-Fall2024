welcome back to learning to code with Python less than six today we'll be talking about functions okay to get started I've got a small program here that will draw a square using the loop we learned before if you need to pause the video to catch up go ahead and do that now all right let's run the program so we're all sure we're on the same page but before I do that I'm going to move the Python shell window down here to the corner we only really need this window now to tell us if we have an error otherwise it's just in the way so I'm going to put it there and leave us plenty of room for our program so let's go ahead and run it good it's drawing a square but what if we want to draw more than one square well we could tell the turtle to move some distance and then repeat this loop draw the square again all right if we run that you'll see now we are moving and drawing a second square but what if we wanted to draw a lot of squares it would be kind of a pain to have to copy and paste this loop over and over again wouldn't it be nice if we could just have a command called square and then any time we wanted to draw a square we could just give that command well we can by making something called a function you can think of a function as a way to define your own commands that you can use anytime you want so let's get rid of these loops and let's define our square function we start by saying def which is short for define and then what we want our function to be named well let's just name it square that makes sense right and remember we're defining a command and commands always have the parentheses and then we have a colon and now we're going to type what the definition of the square should be well we know what the definition of the square should be right it should be a loop so that would be the definition of a square now if we run this program you'll notice that nothing happens why is that well we defined what Square should be but we never told the computer to actually draw a square we just gave it the definition so now that we've defined our command we can use our command so we can say Square and then we could have Fred move some distance and draw another square but there's another problem with our square command every square that we draw is the same size what if I want to draw squares that are bigger or smaller I'd like the square command to work like this or I put a number inside the parentheses and that's how big the square would be so how do I do that well in our definition of the square we need to add to the definition that something will be inside the parentheses and that something will be some number for the size so let's call it size so now whenever we give the square command the number that we put in the parentheses will be inserted here and called size and now instead of going always going forward 100 we should go forward sighs let's see what that looks like Square that's 100 and a square that's 150 so now our square command is finished we can draw a square any size we want anywhere we want so let's do something fun let's draw squares all over the screen so instead of just drawing these two squares I want to draw a whole bunch of them so let's make a loop and let's actually count to a hundred this time before we go any further let's talk about coordinates you've probably seen this in math class but even if you haven't don't worry it's not too complicated if you imagine that this big rectangle is the turtle window and here's the turtle here in the center then every spot on the screen where the turtle can be can be described by two numbers called its coordinates the first number which is called X is where the turtle is horizontally to the left or right as that X number gets bigger the turtle moves to the right as that X number gets smaller the turtle moves to the left and the second number which we call Y describes the vertical or up and down position of the turtle and why gets bigger as the turtle goes up the screen and why gets smaller as the turtle goes down the screen so knowing that we can tell the turtle to go to any spot on the screen by giving it those two numbers of where we want it to be for example if we wanted it to go to 100 comma 50 that would be 100 pixels over this way and 50 pixels up and the turtle would wind up somewhere over here okay so to make our random squares that we want to have anywhere all over the screen we need to pick two numbers tell the turtle to go there and then draw the square in that spot in order to pick those two numbers for where we want the turtle to go we want them to be random so we're going to need to learn some new commands first thing we'll do is up at the top of our program we're going to also import random this tells the computer that we need access to the random commands and now let's pick a number for the X the command for picking a random number is random dot R and range and then inside of the parentheses of R and range you put two numbers the start and the end for the two numbers you want to pick a random number between so let's put 200 200 so that way in our turtle window it'll pick something to the left or to the right and then we need to do the same thing for y okay so now we have a random number for X and a random number for Y and now we'd like to tell the turtle to go to that coordinate the command to tell the turtle to move to a certain coordinate is go to and then you just tell it the X and the y so we'll say go to that random X&Y that we picked and when you get there draw a square and let's just put 100 for the size of the square right now when we run this program the computers going to count to a hundred and loop around and do these four commands a hundred times pick a random X pick a random Y go to that spot and draw a square let's see what happens we have a problem every time we say go to the turtle still leaving a trail behind it we probably want to pick the pin up in between each square don't we we're also moving kind of slow so the squares are going to take a long time to draw so I'm going to go ahead and close it so let's add a command up at the top to set the speed to something fast remember zero is the fastest it means move instantly without animating and then before we go to we need to tell Fred to pick the pen up so that's no longer touching the paper and then we better remember to put it back down again before we draw the square that's better let's see what happens now much better that's exactly what I wanted to happen and there it's done 100 squares now let's make one more change I'd like it if the squares were all different sizes so instead of every square of being a hundred let's pick a random number for that too now there's two ways we could do this we could pick a random number and let's call it size we'll just make a variable called size and we'll put random dot R and range and let's make the squares anywhere between 10 and 200 in size and then we draw the square we'll just use that size let's see how that goes now we have squares that are all different sizes now the other way we could do it is instead of picking this random number putting it in a variable and then using that variable for square we could skip a step and just put that random dot R and range command inside the parentheses of square so it would look like that so we're saying make a square and inside the parentheses of square we're saying pick a random number between 10 and 200 you can do it either way both will work the same and it really depends on which one is easier for you to read and understand so it works exactly the same but I will point out it's easy to make a mistake especially when you're first starting out when you do it this way and the reason is that a lot of beginners tend to forget to count their parentheses there always need to be the same number of left and right parentheses they may look odd to you to see two parentheses at the end here that's because they're separate pairs these two parentheses go with random dot R and range and these two parentheses go with the square command I see a lot of students typing this and then wondering why they're getting an error in their program and it's because they left off that last parenthesis so this parenthesis has no match okay let's add one more thing to this program before we're done we have the squares going in at random location and we have the squares being a random size but let's also change the colors to be nice if every square was a different color well we can't pick a random number for color but we can do this at the top of our program we can make a variable called color list and this will just be a list of different colors you can use as many as you like I'll put a few in here okay remember how lists work they have square brackets on the end and each item inside the list is separated by a comma now we have a variable called color list it's just a list of different colors so before we draw the square each time we want to pick a random color and tell Fred to change his color to that well instead of using the random dot Rand range command we're going to use a different one so let's make a variable called Col which is short for color and we're going to pick a random color out of that list the command is random dot choice color lists the random dot choice command says inside the parentheses tell me a list and I'll pick a random one out of it so now this variable is equal to one of these colors red blue whatever now we can tell Fred to set his color to that red color and that should do it let's try it out all right let's stop there go ahead and experiment with this try changing some of the things around instead of a square try defining your own shapes like the star that we made before and I'll see you next time you
