welcome to know your node this is a series of video game engine videos where we take a single node type and show how it's used maybe you never came across this particular node before and maybe you were just wondering what it's for but hopefully after this you'll have a new tool that you can use in making your own games this installment will be really short and sweet because we're talking about one of the simplest nodes there is the Y sort node so here we have a really common situation I've got a bunch of NPC sprites that I've made 12 instances of and they just are walking around the map but it looks really unnatural when they cross in front of each other because the draw order they were always correct the draw order is just the order that they're listed here in the scene but for example when a sprite like that right there when the sprite is higher than another one it's you know has a lower Y value it should look like it's behind it by its feet should be on top of the other ones head and so what what you want to do is make a draw order respect the y coordinate of the sprite and draw it farther back the higher it gets and you could do that incurred and it's a really common situation you need to do if you don't have a great node already set up for you to use that and I have it right here and that's other scene called the Y sword and it couldn't be simpler why sort node has exactly one property enabled that you want to be on or not and I've just taken all these NPC's and I've made them children Y sort that's it no more configuration nothing else but if I run the scene you will see that none of that weird drawing happens whenever a sprite goes is above another one it's automatically behind it and that's it use this node it's your friend all right I'll see you next time you you
