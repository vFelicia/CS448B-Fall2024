welcome back to know your nodes this is a series of Godot game engine videos where we take a single node type from the engine and show how it's used maybe it's a node that you've never come across before or maybe it's one you were just wondering what the best way to use it is but hopefully after this you'll have a new tool that you can use in making your own games this time we'll be talking about the path follow 2d node so our focus is going to be on this path follow 2d node but we do need to know about a couple of other nodes in order to make it work because as you can see from the description the very brief description point sampler for a path 2d so down here at the longer description you see that the path solitude e needs to have a path 2d parent that's going to define what path it's going to follow and if we click on path 2d a path to denote is a very very simple node all it does is contain a curve 2d and what the curve 2d well a curve 2d is a V a curve in 2d space and you may not may or may not be familiar with the term Bezier curve but really it's just a way of defining a twodimensional path in space and you can do it in a lot of different ways but there's a really easy way to do it in the editor and that's what we're going to do so if we go over here I've got an empty scene and I'm just going to add a path 2d as the route and and when you do that when you add a path 2d you'll see you get some new editor buttons up here these are going to help you edit your path so see this one right here that has the little green plus on it this lets you add points in space so if you click on points in empty space you will add points and if I do that right now you'll see everywhere I click creating another point and it is connecting them so now I have a path going from here to here and you can delete points right I didn't want this one in between there I could delete that if you want to grab this button right here you can adjust where they are so you can move them around you can insert ones in between and so on and then the other thing you can do is with this button right here this lets you do the control points and the control points or how you control how curvy the path is so if I grab one of these one of the points you can see I pull this control node I can change how it curves between the two points right and you can have these coming out of each of the points in whatever method you choose and you can basically sculpt your path this way and have it go curve around the way you want it to curve around right and until you have the path the way you want it and you know it can be timeconsuming to to set these up and get them perfectly the way you want them so I've gone ahead and created a path right here that's a loop basically a figure eight it starts up here in the upper left hand corner and it just loops around in a figure eight pattern back to the end now we have our path we want to follow we can add our path follow node so we're going to add a node that's follow to D alright and we want that to be a child of the path and I'm just going to name this follow and so you know the path to D doesn't have really any properties to worry about it just has it just holds this curve the path follow does have a lot of properties that we're going to experiment around with and the main one is this offset offset is how you control where along the curve you want to move and now we need something to move if we look back over at our documentation for the path follow it says it's useful for making other nodes follow a path for that the nodes must be descendants of this node when setting the offset the descendants will move accordingly so we need to put something underneath this as follows it is going to be the thing that will follow the path and so for that we're going to add a sprite grab sprite real quick and I'm going to use this little spaceship texture throw that in there and just real quickly I'm going to scale it down a little bit because it's kind of large and okay now if we look back at our path follow property one of the options here is rotate on or off and that controls if I set up so to read rotation back to zero that controls whether the node as it follows the path will rotate to follow the path right do you want to remain want it to remain always facing the same direction or do you want it to look like it is you know a car driving along the path and it rotates to follow so we're going to put that on and then oh by the way since our sprite started out pointing sideways I do need to rotate this minus 90 degrees that's just because of the default sprite orientation it's drawn pointing up but zero degrees is pointing to the right in our 2d space all right so we're on our path follow we're going to rotate I want the spaceship to look like following the path and loop whether you want to when you reach the end back to the beginning or not is this a oneway path you know with a start and an end or is it a loop well ours is a loop so I'm going to turn that on and now this offset so this offset is going to control however long your path is you can go along the offset so for example if I put 100 I'm going to be 100 units along the path all right I could go a thousand its way over here and you see how the sprite is rotating to match the direction of the path so you can use the offset to set this you can also use the unit offset the unit offset just Maps the length of the path to a difference between zero and one right so zero point five would be halfway along the path wherever that is right so you can use either of those depending on how you want to measure your distance so now let's look at how we might do this in code so I've added a brief script here it just takes our follow node and in the process function I set the offset to whatever the current offset is plus some number times Delta and that's all you need to do now our spaceship is going to fly along the path and remember because we've set it to loop then when the loop and when the offset reaches the maximum it gets set right back to zero again and goes through again so so our ship will just continue to fly around the path as it goes it's a really simple example of how to use the path follow 2d one more thing that I'll do that I thought was a little son was I've gone back into the script now and I've changed it a little bit and we're not going to use the set offset anymore to steadily change it instead we're going to use a tween so I've added a new tween and I'm going to set the tween to interpolate the property on the follow node of unit offset and I want that to go from 0 to 1 which of course goes from the start to the end I wanted to take 6 seconds and I'm going to use linear which was going to look like what we did before right it's going to go at a steady speed and I'm going to set repeat to true so that between will keep going over and over again and that's going to look similar to what we had before again we're going to take exactly 6 seconds to get all the way around the loop but what this lets you do is do things like using a different tween function like for example sine is going to make it so that the ship looks Eller 8 out of its start area and be going faster around the track and then slow back down again at the end if you have a start point you want it to go from and you can get a lot of really interesting effect by changing around which clean function you use and and how you set it up alright I hope this was helpful if you've never used the path to D or the path followed to D nodes before maybe you can see some applications on how to use them in your projects maybe you're making a tower defense game this would be a great way to have your mobs come in and follow a certain path through the environment you can control that path programmatically as well you don't have to draw the path using the editor there's ways to do it with wood code as well and gives you a lot of flexibility of how you can control how things move through the environment thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
