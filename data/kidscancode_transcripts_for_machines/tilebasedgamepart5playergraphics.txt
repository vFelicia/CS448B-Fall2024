welcome back to game development a game this is part 5 of our tile based game project and in this video we're gonna get started with the player graphics and start planning ahead for some of the gameplay features that we will be making in the next coming weeks in the last video we made our map scrollable and made it so that we can create a map that's much bigger than the screen area and move around on it and that allows us to do things like for example I made this little map that has a maze so we got a maze here that you can try and find your way through but one thing about this is you can sure see a whole lot of the maze at once so what we could do and I think I'm going to do is go over here to my settings and make my tile size 64 so the toes will be much larger and then things are going to be more like this right so we have much more of feeling of exploration right we can only see a limited part of the screen at a time and of course this is a maze so there's only one route through it so that's not really ideal so I also have this other map I'm just gonna go over here that's that I saved that's actually this map is taken from a level from the classic arcade game gauntlet and so it's a nice map you can run around in and has all sorts of different rooms and things but one thing that you might notice depending on how you've laid out your map is that it can be very hard to navigate through smaller openings like if you leave a one tile gap for example say there was a powerup in here that I wanted to pick up it's really hard to get down into that little hole because my sprite is the exact same there we go but it was difficult right as the sprite is the exact same size as a tile so there's no leeway there so we probably want our player sprite to be at least slightly smaller than the size of the tile and we could do that we could adjust the size of the square but first before we do that or instead of doing that I'm gonna start talking about how we're gonna put together the graphics of this game starting with the player sprite so the first thing that I want to do before we change the graphics around to start working on improving the movement and the controls is I want to go over here to our player sprite and change some of this code to start using vectors instead of individual variables like we're doing here we've talked about vectors before vectors are very useful for lots of things and you're gonna see as we go into this project some of the things that I have in mind are going to be a lot easier to do with vectors then they're going to be with individual variables and having to do the trigonometry that's involved with finding angles of things and and and all that sort of stuff and you'll see how that goes as we go on but so I'm going to load this by game vector class and I'm going to use that for a lot of my variables in my player and especially right here we're gonna have we're just going to have a velocity vector instead of VX and V Y and we're gonna have a position vector instead of this individual X&Y so this is going to be the X and the y times tile size and then we don't need those so I've replaced four variables with just two right if that means we got to go down here and we've got to clean up all of these things so I'm going to duplicate this line move that down to here and for the movement we're just going to change these to be the velocity X or the velocity dot Y is what we're going to set to the speeds and also these and which means oops which means we can go over here and in this triangle or me sorry in the diagonal fix we can change this to just multiplying the velocity times 0.707 1 now we're also going to have to fix the update here and we're just going to say that self dot pause we just add the velocity to that instead of that and then we don't need to do that and then we just move our rectangle is equal to each of our positions okay simplifies that a little bit and finally we got to do that in the colliding here so this is going to be velocity X velocity X velocity y Y and Y so we're gonna be using velocity in all these places and everywhere we had self dot X and self dot y we're gonna use the position instead they're there they're there and they're these are all going to be position okay and that I think is everything we need to change okay there we go so we're back to where we want we're before we're still moving around now we can start talking about what kind of graphics we want to use for this player sprite so I spent some time looking through open game art and trying out some different options that were there and because I want to stick to freely licensed you know non copyrighted imagery I went back to our old friend Kenny and I found this which is Kenny's topdown shooter pack it has lots of great tiles that we're going to be able to use to layout our game environment and a bunch of different sprites for good and bad guys to do all sorts of different things with so we're gonna make a this we're going to use this art so this is gonna be a topdown game of course most of the code we write will work just the same as if we were doing a kind of Zelda style side view which really is a topdown game you just draw the sprites with a slight side perspective but the movement and everything is going to work pretty much the same okay so this is what the art Pat look that looks like so we're gonna use one of these sprites for our player to start with and we'll get to the rest of it as we get a chance here's a little preview of some a mockup of how the art goes together looks really nice you can do all sorts of different rooms and environments outdoor and indoor and I've got some coollooking little zombies that can chase you around okay so so we're gonna use the little picture of one of the characters for our player sprite right and so that's easy enough to start with we just need to load that and use it in our sprite class instead of the rectangle so I'm gonna go over here to our load data and I'm going to load the player image oh and by the way we did add an image folder to put all this stuff in so we're gonna add that that's wherever our game folder is and it's called just called IMG so that's where our stuff is going to live so we're gonna load showing that image folder with its called man you know what I'm gonna do is we're gonna we're just going to create some variables for this stuff so we're going to have a lot of new settings for the player so let's go over here to our player settings and we're gonna say that layer image is going to be it's called man blue let me double check the name underscore guttin dot PNG so that's the picture we want to use so we load it in the loading section of our game and in our sprite we can just use that here for our image player image and we don't want to fill it with yellow and that is all we need to do to get the image in there alright so there's my character so that's easy enough we still have the wall collision we have the rectangle being drawn around the sprite as you can see and then all works fine except of course we don't always want to be facing to the right like this that doesn't really work I want I need to be able to turn in all the directions and that is where we're going to have to make it decision a big decision here on how the gameplay is going to work okay and the big decision that we're gonna have to make here is what kind of movement do we want to allow now we could let's say we were sticking to fourway movement updown leftright no diagonals right then we need to have the sprite turn right like this and face in the direction that we need it to point and that means that you can only shoot in those directions which makes it kind of hard when something is you know in a diagonal direction to you which means do we have eight positions and we rotate you know in between those if you've ever played a game that allows you like this that allows you to do diagonal shooting you have to hold down the two arrow keys and you're moving in that direction while you're shooting in that direction it gets pretty it gets pretty tricky our other option is to allow free movement all right you can turn at any angle in the face in any direction and I like that a little bitter so that's what we're going to do I can see now that we've already gone over a little a little over 12 minutes so we're going to do that in the next video I don't want to make this this video too long so at this point you should have gotten prepared we have our vectors in place for all all of our location and velocity and you have the player image in place if you've decided to use some different art just pick something that will work for you know topdown movement and something that will look okay when you rotate it to face in all directions I recommend you stick with the the Kenny game art packets are really nice packed because it's got a you know complete set of art and the link to it will be below in the comments and you can go and get that and be ready for the next video where we start talking about rotating our players right and all of the things that are going to come along with that and a couple of things that we will run into will be a little tricky to solve so we've got that to look forward to so I will see you in the next video thanks for watching you
