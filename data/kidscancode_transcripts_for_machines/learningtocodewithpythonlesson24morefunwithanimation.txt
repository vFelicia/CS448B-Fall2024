welcome back to learning to code with python today we're going to have some fun by extending the animation example we made last time in our last video we learned how to create a ball object and use that ball object definition to create multiple balls that will bounce around the screen my question at the end of the last video was what if we wanted to not have three balls but we wanted to have one 100 Balls bouncing around the screen well of course we could say new ball four new ball five new ball six and so on and also remember to do them in the animation Loop but that would be a lot of typing and a lot of repetition so there's definitely a better way the better way is to use a property of objects in Python objects can be treated just the same as any other kind of variable which means that just like with a string variable or a integer variable for example we could put them in a list so why don't we make a list and add all of our balls to that list so we could make a list called balls and that's going to start out being an empty list nothing in it and now instead of creating balls individually what we're going to do is make a loop let's count to 100 and each time through this Loop we want to make a new ball and add it to the list well the command to add something to a list is take the list and you say do append append means add to the end of the list so what do we want to append we want to append a ball with and we'll start out just making them all be red and size 50 okay so now instead of creating these balls individually we've now got at the end of this Loop we've got a list called balls that has 100 individual ball objects in it so now all we need to do in here is tell our program that we want to move all 100 of those ball objects so we can use a loop for that as well and we can say for each ball in the ball list ball. move so we're going through we're doing a loop through the list of balls one at a time and we're using the variable ball to stand for each ball and then we're saying take that ball and move it now let's see what happens now the first thing you might notice is that doesn't look like 100 Balls and they're all very clumped together right they're not spread out can you figure out why the answer is that each ball when it's created we give it a random X speed and a random YP speed but our choices for what those speeds could be is very small it's only between one and seven so out of the 100 Balls a lot of them are going to have the same speeds so they're all right on top of each other so let's make it spread out a little bit more and have a little bit more action so one thing we could do is we could increase this this number right to spread out the ball some more how about we go between positive and negative numbers so sometimes they'll be going to the left sometimes they'll be going up so let's see how much difference that makes there we go now now we have them much more spread out there's still a little bit of clumping because there's still not that many differences in the speeds so another thing we could do is we could change the sizes they don't all have to be the same size instead of having 50 here for every ball being the same size we could change that to a random number so let's say we wanted to make this random between 50 and 100 right I just replaced that the number 50 with this command to pick a random number so now I'll have objects that are all different sizes there we go so some of them are fast some of them are slow some are bigger than others and here's a little question for you do you know why this one isn't moving at all well in our random speeds the X speed is anything between minus 10 and 10 well zero is in between there and the YP speed is also between Min 10 and 10 and zero is between there so it's possible to get a random speed of zero and zero now how about the color well if you remember when we did our random colors in the turtle exercises we can do a random color by having a list and I've already typed one here with a bunch of bunch of colors in it and instead of them all being red I want to pick a random. choice of colors right remember the random. choice command tells the computer to pick something out of a list I've got a lot more color and you can play around with that change things things around try making the balls all be bigger maybe you want enormous um shapes bouncing around right they don't have to be circles you can get some pretty cool effects you want to change this into re rectangle now instead of creating ovals are balls are all rectangle shapes the last thing I want to point out and some of you might have already gone and tried this out is this number right here how many balls we're animating around on the screen well eventually remember your animation is happening in this Loop and the computer is going through this Loop and it's going through each object in the list and moving it each object in the list and moving it and then updating the screen and then trying to do it again the bigger this list gets the longer it's going to take the computer to do this step and the longer it's going to take to do this whole Loop which means that at a certain point things will start to slow down now where the Slowdown happens depends on how fast your computer is but for example and I'm going to sh these down again just so we can see it go back to a small size for example if I increase the number up to 500 now there's five times as many objects on the screen and it's still pretty smooth but what happens if I made it a thousand and double it again do you see how it's starting to get kind of choppy the computer can't move that many objects fast enough for the animation to still be smooth so that's about it for this program go ahead and experiment with it try making changes see what kind of effects you can get to happen have fun with it and see what you can make and I'll see you in the next lesson
