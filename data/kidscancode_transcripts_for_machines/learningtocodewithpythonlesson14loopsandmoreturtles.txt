welcome to learning to code with Python lesson 4 today we're going to talk about loops and do a little bit more drawing with turtles okay for this lesson let's get back to Fred the turtle so I'm going to import my turtle and create the turtle window alright and remember how we changed Fred's shape I'm going to do that again okay so let's say with Fred we wanted to draw a square what would we need to do what are the steps well we need to go forward a certain amount let's call it 100 then we need to turn to our left 90 degrees right and then we need to do that same thing again for that side of the square turn left and left and there we go we drew a square if that was a lot of typing to do just to draw a square and if you noticed we were typing the same thing a bunch of times weren't we we had to type forward and left forward and left forward and left we're doing the same thing over and over and actually if we wanted to get back to the exact same place we started we should put another left here if there's one thing that programmers hate it's having to type the same thing over and over again computers on the other hand can't get tired or bored so there must be a better way the better way is to use something called a loop a loop is a way to tell the computer to repeat some commands over and over in this case we want the computer to repeat these two commands forward and left and we want it to repeat them four times one two three four so we want what's called a counting loop we want the computer to count to four and each time it counts droop these commands here's what a counting loop looks like first let's do reset so that we don't have our square we already drew there and now let's type the loop we're going to say for I in range for what this command means is I want you to count to four that's what range four does and for each number which we're going to use I to stand for the number for each number in that range of four I want you to do something and this colon tells the computer some commands are going to come after this the commands that come after that colon are the ones that you're going to repeat so I'm going to press enter and notice it didn't do anything yet it's waiting for me to type what commands it wants to repeat so we're going to say Fred dot forward 100 Fred left 90 and then we're going to press ENTER and notice it's waiting for me to type a third command if there was a third command I wanted to repeat but there isn't so I'm going to press ENTER one more time and there we go we have a square and that's what a counting loop looks like now I want you to notice a couple of things about how this loop looks notice that the two commands that we wanted to repeat see how they're indented there's space here they're not lined up with the F in for in Python that space that indenting tells the computer that these commands aren't by themselves they belong to this loop they're part of it there are the things that the loop after the colon is looking for that it wants to repeat so what we've done is we've taken these eight commands that we had to type to draw a square and we've turned it into only three that's a lot less typing but watch what else you can do with loops let's erase that and let's say that this time I want you to count to eight and then each time you're going to go forward 100 and you're going to turn left 225 degrees what do you think that's going to draw well let's look if we did those one at a time that would have taken 16 separate commands so let's look a little more closely at what's going on inside of one of these counting loops you remember we have this letter I hear this I is actually a variable and each time we go through the loop I is being set equal to the number that we're currently counting so what if I count to five in each time I just print out what I is see and don't forget we always start counting at zero right so I was equal to zero the first time through the loop the second time through the loop it was equal to one and so on so to count to five or to run the loop five times we counted zero one two three four so what this means is we can use that letter I the variable that's keeping track of the counting through our loop we can use it in our loop so let's reset and let's try an example so let's say we're going to count to 20 and then each time through we're going to go forward not a certain amount but ten times I so that means the first time through the loop we're going to go ten times zero then the second time ten times one then ten times two and so on and then in between each one we'll turn left 90 so it kind of looks like the square except every side is not going to be the same size so let's look what that does this is a good time to talk about how fast or in this case have slow fred draws you saw how long it took to draw that well there is a command called speed that will let you tell Fred to go faster this number can be anything from 1 to 10 with 10 being the fastest or you can use my favorite which is 0 which basically just says don't animate Fred moving at all just draw the thing I told you to draw and for this next example that's what I'm going to use ok so first let's reset and then we'll set the speed to 0 and now for this example I'm going to count to 50 and each time I'm going to draw a circle and that circle is going to be I times 3 and radius and then in between each circle I'm going to turn left just 10 degrees now watch what this draws pretty neat huh so you can do some pretty amazing stuff with loops let's see a few more examples unfortunately after you reset you do have to set the speed again ok let's try this one and before we draw this time let's add a little color and I'm going to make the line a little bit thicker so it'll be easier to see ok so we're going to count to 20 and then we're going to draw a circle I times 3 but this time we're going to put another thing in the parenthesis 180 and when you draw a circle the first number is how big the circle is going to be just like we've done before but then you can put a comma and then how much of the circle to draw so 180 degrees is half a circle so we're going to be drawing half circles and then we're going to turn right 45 degrees okay one and this next one I'm going to show you are both shapes that were invented by students who have taken my class before we like to call this one the Rose so let's reset we'll set our speed back up to zero and this time how about we do green and we'll set the width again so it's a nice fat line to draw with okay so we're going to count to 100 and then we're going to go forward oops forward I times two we're going to draw a circle I times two but only ninety degrees of it which is a quarter circle and then we're going to turn right twenty degrees remember this was actually discovered by a student just experimenting and trying different things let's see what that looks like pretty cool so now it's your turn see what you can draw try different things put different commands in the loop change the numbers around experiment see what you can make and I'll see you in the next lesson you
