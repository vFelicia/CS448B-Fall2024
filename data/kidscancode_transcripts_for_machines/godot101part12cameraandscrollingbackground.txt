welcome back to Godot 101 this is part 12 and in this video we're going to explore how to add a scrolling camera that follows your player and also make a scrolling background alright let's get started so here we have our simple platformer setup and so now I want to take a look at what would happen if we had our screen laid out like this I'm going to duplicate this platform a couple more times and I'm going to move them and just sort of arrange them kind of like this all right so now my I want my character to be able to run along and jump on all four of these platforms but of course these are going to be off the screen right when we run it we can't see those and I would just go off the screen and that's no good so I want to have a camera that will follow the player wherever it goes in the game world and that's really easy to do with Godot because we have a camera node here's our player scene we're going to hit add and we're going to add a camera 2d this is the camera to denote the camera 2d we're going to rename it to camera and all we need to do on this node to get it to work is go down here and check the box next to it that says current current to be on and you could have multiple cameras in your scene but only one of them can be the current one and that's the one that you know the View window will track so if we hit play now you can already see but now the screen is scrolling as we move along couldn't get easier all right so it's very simple to just set up and and use the camera now there's lots of settings on the camera things like dragging and things like that and that's sort of how how you want the camera to act right so for example if I turn on smoothing here alright so now instead of the camera tracking my player instantly it's going to slowly catch up to see when I move the camera just sort of panned along and catches up to me so just smooth smooth that movement out and you can set the speed for how quickly that movement happens and and all that kind of stuff you can in the drag margin here you can set how far from the edges you want the character to be able to walk before the camera starts scrolling right and you can set those to zero and have it not even work right you could have it only scroll so I decide not to not do the upanddown scrolling like this a lot of things you can play with and I recommend you you you mess around with these right you can turn on and off these things tries try changing the different settings around and see how it works and how you can customize it to give you the look that you want for your game once you have the camera working the way you want it now we need to talk about what do we do about the background if you can see obviously we scroll far enough we get past the edges of the background and we don't see it anymore so if we look at our main scene here our background image is this this is the size of it so if we want it to extend we can a couple things we could do you could obviously take another pic of sprite and duplicate it and put another one next to it right and then you would see it but rather than do that we're going to take advantage of the fact that this this piece of art was drawn in such a way that it is tigh leveled at the the lefthand edge and the righthand edge if you put them right next to each other there's no transition and they meet up well so it's designed to be to be tiled horizontally so if we look at our texture here we can go we can click the little right arrow and go to the flag section and if we go down here we make sure we have repeat selected you might not on yours if you have repeat selected that tells it that this is a repeatable texture and now if we go back here and turn region to on right now my back under here because it became really small because the region rectangle by default is set to zero width and zero height so what I'm going to do is I'm going to set the height to the height of the image which is 1536 that's how I'll call the original texture is and for the width the width is 307 all right so if I set that there we have our original image back if I wanted to tile further I can just make this with larger right if I multiply it by 4 then the image is going to become 4 times wider and because the repeat flag is on we will see the image just repeating over and over again all right and then you can also drag that to where you want it to be if we want to place it so that there's plenty of image to the left so you don't see any gray when the player is all the way on the lefthand side of the platform here but also when they get over here to the right they still will see the background and that's going to look fine but there's one more improvement we can make right as well as having the background scrolling back there it would look even cooler if it scrolled at a slightly slower speed than our player moves and this is called parallax scrolling it makes it look like the things in the background are a much farther distance away so they'll only scroll a little bit as you move from side to side so if I go back here and go to add node and I search for parallax you can see we have two different nodes that come up the parallax background and the parallax layer and so what you do to set this up is you use the parallax background so we're going to add that and to that parallax background we're going to add a parallax layer now parallax backgrounds can multiple layers because what that lets you do is have different different layers scrolling at different speeds and things like that to get really really advanced looking effects but we will put the background now into that parallax layer okay so now our background is part of the parallax layer and we can go here and say what we how we want it to move right how we want it to change and for example under motion we can choose what scale we want to use right if we put this to zero the popup tells us right here if the axis fit to zero it will not move at all it'll stick with the camera so it won't change but right now we have it set to one so let's see what happens when we run it it looks pretty much the same right but if we set this to half now the motion is scaled at half the speed but the camera moves now do you see that see how the the background is scrolling much slower all right very nice looking effect very easy to create well looks really cool that's it so feel free to play around with this you know if you change the change the scale and and how it runs if we change to point two here right and then it looks like it's hardly moving at all running all the way across all four platforms barely moves that background very much so it makes it feel like it's much farther away in the distance and if you want to wanted to add another parallax layer in between you could have that scroll by at a still different speed feel free to experiment I hope it all made sense to you please post in the comments below if you have any questions and I'll see you next time you
