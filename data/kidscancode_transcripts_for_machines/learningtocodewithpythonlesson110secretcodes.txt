welcome back to learning to code with python lesson 10 today we're going to talk about cryptography or secret codes there are lots of different ways to encode secret messages the one we're going to talk about today is a very famous one called the Caesar Cipher the Caesar Cipher works like this you take the letters of the alphabet and then you shift those letters over a certain number of spaces the most famous the most common being 13 spaces and you see now L lines up with y g lines up with t and so on and then you take your your message which is called the clear text and by looking up each letter and what the new letter is you have your secret code or your Cipher text so let's look at how we would start making the code for this well we know we're going to want to ask the person to input a clear text once they've put that in now we have something that we could encrypt now how do we do that well whatever they type in is going to be a string like this right so we want to do a loop where we go through each letter one at a time look up what the new letter is and save that in a new variable which we could call Cipher text so since this is something we might want to do over and over again it makes sense to define the encrypting as a function we can say def encrypt right and what you pass to the encrypt function the the argument will be the clear text okay and our Cipher text is just going to start out as nothing right we haven't done anything yet now we want to do that Loop through the clear text so we can say for each character and I'll just use car here for short for character for character in clear text okay so what do we want to do with each letter so let's pretend that our secret message and I'll just write this up here as a comment so we have something to look at let's pretend that our secret message is this so when we start our Loop the first character is going to be S so we need to figure out what s is going to become well over here on our chart we see s should become F well how do we get there well if the shift is 13 we know we need to count 13 spaces from s we need to add 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 see s becomes F so we need a copy of the alphabet that we can look at and count so let's make a variable with all the letters of the alphabet in it we'll call it Alpha for short and this will just be n o p QR s t u v WX y z there we go so that's all the letters of the alphabet so now if the character that we're on is s we just need to find where s is in this string and add 13 to it right and if we get go off the end we need to go back around to the start there are 26 letters in the alphabet so the positions of each of these will be from zero to 25 so when we count we count up to 25 if if we get to 26 we need to go back to zero but we have two other problems we need to consider what if the secret message has capital letters in it right the letter capital T never appears in here so we have two choices we could make a whole another list of all the capital letters and we could count those separately or we can just use a handy little function that python has where we take the clear text after the person types it in and we convert it to lowercase so the lower function can be added to any string and it will take all the characters in the string and just convert them to lowercase okay our other problem is what if they have characters that are not in the alphabet so that's so cool what do we do with this apostrophe well typically in simple examples like this you ignore punctuation or numbers we're we're going to ignore any characters in the message that are not actually part of the alphabet so that means as we're going through the characters the first thing we need to check is just to see is the character in the alphabet so is it one of these right if it is then we'll encrypt it but if it isn't we'll just ignore it and add it to the cipher text so we'll just say Cipher text plus equals character right so when it's a apostrophe it's not in the alphabet so we'll just add it to the cipher text without changing it to anything else so now we need to figure out what is this what is this how do we get this s to turn into the right character well first we need to find where is the s in the alphabet well there's another handy string function called find if we say alpha. find the way this works is it says whatever character this is find it in Alpha so it will go through Alpha and it'll find where the S is and it'll give us back the position which for S happens to be 18 so that's where the S is but we want to find where the new we want to find the new position of the new letter we want so let's make a variable here called new pause and we'll save that in there so we want to take where the S is and add 13 to it okay so that's going to work fine if our position if our starting character is over on the lower half of the alphabet because when we add 13 to it we'll end up over here somewhere but problem is with our s we're taking 18 and we're adding 13 which gives us 31 and obviously there's no character 31 we want to wrap around again so what we really want to do is take that 31 and subtract uh 26 from it and that gives us five which is where we want to be 0 one two three four five the F so we could write some code that says if the new pause is greater than 26 then subtract 26 from the new pause but there's an easier way if we use that remainder operator that we talked about early on in the course and what we want to do is divide by 26 and take the remainder what's left over let's try it out and see how that works if we have a number that's less than 26 and we say what's the remainder well 26 doesn't go into it at all so the whole thing is left over and so that's fine if we have a small number this won't change it any but if we have a bigger number than 26 and we divide by 26 then it goes into there once and then there's some left over well there's five left over that gives us the F we want so now we have the correct new pause for our new character that we need for our Cipher text so let's add that letter to our Cipher text so now Cipher text is just going to have added to it Alpha index new pause right so in the case of the S we got five so Alpha number five gets added to Cipher text which is the F and then so on and then we're done with our Loop we'll go around again we'll do the E we'll go around again we'll do the C and we should be done so now when we finish going through each character in the clear text our Cipher text should now be complete so at the end of our loop after after the for Loop completes we can return the cipher text okay our encrypt function is now complete it does everything it needs to do it takes the clear text goes through character by character figures out where the new position is if it's in the alphabet if it's not in the alphabet it ignores it and then when it's done it gives you back the cipher text so down here we should be able to say print encrypt clear text so we'll type in the clear text and then we'll print out the cipher text so we'll just save this as Caesar and we'll give it a run and see what happens all right let's try secret message first since we know what that should come out as okay so there's our encrypted text is that the same as our example it is now we can try it with anything else we care to try let's try it with something that has uh nonalphabetical characters in it so if we say that's so cool exclamation point so it should it should convert the T to a lower case it should ignore the apostrophe it should ignore the ex exclamation point so that's our Caesar Cipher program now what's cool about the Caesar Cipher since we're using 13 as our shift uh 13 is exactly halfway through the alphabet so subtracting 13 and adding 13 is actually the same thing so if you run your program if we run the program and we paste in the encrypted text we'll actually get back the clear text now that only works if the shift is 13 you're welcome to change this 13 to any other number you want but it won't work in Reverse anymore if you do that then you're going to need to make a function called decrypt that does the exact same process goes through character by character but each time it subtracts the shift instead of adding it and then you could use whichever function you wanted encrypt function to encrypt things decrypt function to decrypt things I'll leave that as an exercise for you to try out so that's the end of this lesson next time we'll start talking about creating computer
