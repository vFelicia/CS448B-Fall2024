welcome to part 6 of learning Godot in this video we're gonna look at a few extra things you might want to add to the game to make it a little bit more appealing if you followed along with the previous steps you have a working game and you can dodge the enemies staying alive as long as you can until one hits you and everything works great but it's a little drab and not very exciting and so this video is going to cover some things you can do to spice it up a little bit and make the game look nicer and the first thing we could do is replace this default gray background which is kind of drab and one way we could do that is by adding a color rect that's a rectangle that will display a solid color pretty straightforward we're gonna drag that and cover up everything now if we leave it here the nodes are drawn in order so that means the color Rictor is gonna be drawn on top of our player so we won't be able to see them so we're gonna put that at the top of the stack so that we can see the player and I'm going to name this background and in the color Rex inspector properties you just click here to pick a color so let's see let's pick a maybe we're underwater we'll take a bluish color let's see how that looks and there we go if instead you had a texture an image that you wanted to use there you could use a texture rect which does the same kind of thing as the color rect it just displays a texture and it can do things like tiling and stretching and things like that if you have a particular image you want to use and you want to make it fit on the screen so that's the background the next big thing we could do is add some sound to this game in your art folder there are two sounds that we can use there's a game over WAV file that's something we want to play when the player dies and then there's an OGG file that's a bit of background music we can play during gameplay to give us an atmosphere so what we want to do is have those working in our main so in main we're gonna add two audio stream player nodes so I'm just gonna add one and then duplicate it now this first one is going to be our game over sound I'm gonna call it the death sound and right here for stream we want to load from our art file the GAMEOVER wav file and you can try it out if you hit playing you can hear it play and so we want to trigger that playing when the game is over so if we go to our mains script then on game over that's where we want to have it happen so we can just add here death sound dot play and that should make it play that sound when we run into something okay and then the second audio stream player is going to be our music and we'll load that OGG file and now we want to go back to our script and we want to start playing that music when the game starts so in the new game function we're going to tell it to play the music and in the game over we're going to add that we want it to stop so we want to stop playing the music when the game ends now when you import an OGG file I click on this and go up to the import tab it should be set to loop automatically make sure that's set because that way when it reaches the end of the music clip it'll automatically start playing it again so let's try that out now and there's our background music playing and when I get hit it stops the next effect we're going to add is I would like the player to have a bit of a trail behind him when he moves and to do that we're going to use a particle node so it's called the particles 2d and I'm going to name that trail now when you create a particle 2d you get an error message because it needs a material attached to a process of particles and we'll get to that in a second but first we're gonna look at the properties here in the inspector emitting whether or not the particles are coming out the number that you want I'm gonna set that to 10 under time we're gonna leave these as they are actually we might up the speed scale a little bit we'll see how it looks setting up particles also requires a bit of trial and error there's a lot of settings a lot of different ways you can make it look and so you can experiment and get a huge number of different effects out of it now here under textures we're gonna use the player's texture so I'm gonna grab the player texture and I'm gonna stick it there now it's showing up there because our remember our texture is really big we when we drew the player we shrunk him down and we're gonna take care of that in the particles material but here it's also showing on top of my player so I'm gonna go down to the visibility and I'm gonna check the show behind parent that way the trail will look like it's coming up from behind the player not from on top of it all right now we need to animate these particles and have them do something and that's done with this process material so if you click the arrow here you can create a shader if you're familiar with writing shaders you can write a shader to do this but we're gonna use a particles material and now all of a sudden we've got some particles dropping down because by default the particles have gravity on them and they just fall down so we're gonna have to change that around so click on the material and now you have a huge list of properties that you can tweak and adjust for this but we definitely want to take gravity and set it to zero so that those things stop falling we want to take our scale and the scale is what we're going to want to change we want it to we want them to start out the size of the player or maybe a little bit smaller and then shrink from there so what we're gonna do is make a scale curve so I'm gonna click down here here arrow here and say new curve texture click on that and now I have this curve that I can draw and I want it to start around just under 0.5 because that's the scale that we set our player to and I want it to end up down around 0 or so okay and now we can't see them because they're appearing behind the player and then shrinking but that's ok we're gonna make them show they're gonna show up when we move now I'm gonna hit the back arrow here to get back to the particles material I also want them to fade out so I'm gonna make a color ramp here so a new gradient texture I click on that for the gradient I want a new gradient and I click on that and now down here are the colors that we're gonna go between so it's starting with black and going to white well what I want to do is click on that first square I don't need to move it and I'm gonna click on what color and I want to start out white that starts out being the original color no change to the color but we are gonna fade it a little bit so we're going to start it around there say and then the ending color is going to be also white but with the Alpha all the way down because we want to basically look like it's fading out and so now we're ready to try it out let's see we have all the settings the way we want them well let's try it out and see what happens oh I know what happened we don't see them because we have to let them stream out behind the player so we're gonna go to the trail and in drawing we're gonna uncheck local coordinates we don't want the part of us to stay attached to the player we want them to stream out behind him so if I move the player around actually you can see the trail right there and the editor going behind it as it moves all right now that should do better there we go now we have a little trail coming out behind us now if you want to get fancier with this we're always using the same texture so it does look a little odd that the facing to the right texture comes out when we move in other directions it also continues to emit when we're standing still so if we happen to stand still on a frame where our pose isn't the same we're gonna see it and so a couple things we can do about that I've just gone into the players script and I've added two commands here I've added two set emitting to true when we're moving and set emitting to false when we stop moving on the trail and that's gonna look a little better when you let go the key and stop moving if I stop for example like that you don't see any particles coming out behind the character the possibilities for particles are pretty much endless and way more than we could go into for this video but hopefully that inspires you with some ideas you could also do things like bubbles coming up from the bottom if you want to continue the underwater theme you could put it in space and have flickering stars in the background you could add some trails or effects to the enemies as well hopefully that gives you some ideas as well thank you for watching and good luck in your future goodo projects
