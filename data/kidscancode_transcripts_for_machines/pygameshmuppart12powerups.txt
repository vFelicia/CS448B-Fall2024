welcome back to game development with pygame in this episode we will be adding powerups to our mouth game so we're getting pretty close to having a complete game but one thing that we're definitely missing is powerups and there's a couple kind of powerups we can do we can do powerups that give you shields so there's a way to get some shield points back and then we can also do some powerups that will increase your or improve your guns now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this class bullet just so that I can use that to make my class power and we'll just call it a POW for short now powerups when we spawn them we're going to just give past them the center of the mob that we just blew up so when I shoot a meteor and it explodes that will it'll have a chance of dropping a powerup so the center so we're just gonna set the wrecks Center to the center and then we also are going to have different kinds of powerups so what I have here is for the art is I've got a little lightning bolt icon and that's going to be the gun powerup and then I have a little shield symbol here these are also from the Kinney game art and those will be my two powerup images so what we're gonna do is choose randomly which kind it is so we'll make a variable called type and it's going to be a random choice between shield and gun so it'll be a shield powerup or a gun thora and then which one do we use well let's go down to our loading image loading code and we're gonna add one more thing here after all the explosions we need to have two types of images so powerup images is going to be a dictionary dictionary lets you do is kind of like a list except item instead of being numbered zero one two three it can have a name so power up images shield will be we're gonna load the image derp and the file name will be is shield gold PNG and then we will just replace for the second one for the gun will be bolt underscore gold now when our class we can just choose randomly between using the shield or the gun image our image is going to be power up images selftaught type so whichever type would you chose shielder or gun and then when we when this spawns on the screen when our player runs into it we can say what type did they run into and do the appropriate action now the speed we're gonna want it to spawn somewhere and then start going downwards and we probably don't want it to be too fast so let's just set that at five right now and we'll see how it goes and we want to kill it if it goes off the bottom of the screen so if the top is greater than the height and that will be our powerup sprite now we just need to spawn them so we'll go down here and like we did with the other different sprite types we're gonna add a powerups group to put them in so we can simply do the collisions and we're gonna spawn a sprite right here if a bullet hit a mob so what we're gonna do is if the bullet hit the mob we want to pick a random number right we want to have it we want to have a chance of spawning a powerup but not necessarily always spawn one so if random dot random random dot random just gives you a number a decimal number between zero and one so if it's greater than 0.9 that means we're gonna have a 10% chance of dropping a powerup and again we can play around with it and see if that's too much too little you know or just right so we're gonna make a POW at the hit dot center we're gonna add it to the all sprites and we're gonna add it to the powerups okay and then we should be ready to try it out so let's see what happens oops hit dot center hit dot rect dot Center all right so let's see if there went one but it was kind of fast wasn't it 10% might be a little too rare maybe not but they definitely move a little too fast so let's change that we'll go up here and change that speed let's make it nice and slow and so that we have a good chances of catching them especially while we're testing we want these things to be easy to grab so we can make sure they work so if we have these fright the the powerups spawning and they're coming down we are going to need to see if we hit one so we'll add another little collision check here if the player it hit a power up okay so this time the hits check is going to be a sprite collide between the player and the powerups and we're gonna say it true here because we want the powerup to disappear now it's very unlikely that we will have two of them on the screen at the same time but I suppose it's possible so we need to say what happens if we catch each kind so let's start with the shield one that's really simple so if we hit a shield powerup so we're gonna say if hit dot type is shield then we want to give some shield back so player dot shield plus equals let's say 20 so the shield gives us back 20 the shield powerup gives us back 20 and if the shield is greater than or equal to greater than equal to 100 we will cap it at 100 we don't want that to go above so now let's make them spawn temporarily let's make them spawn very often so that we can make sure that this is working so that we can see what the shield one does okay so I need to take some hits here and then I'll go grab a shield there you see my shield go back up let's grab another one just so you can see yeah perfect all right so let's change that back to the 90% or the 10% chance of spawning and what I thought I would do is instead of the player dot shield and instead of the shield always giving you back exactly 20 we could make it a random amount so that you never know exactly how much you're gonna get back so we could just put this as anywhere it gives you anywhere between 10 and say 30 so some of the powerups will give you a bunch you know a third of your shield back almost and then some of them only give you a little bit so you're you want to catch as many of these as you can get to get your shields back to full okay then that'll do it for the shield powerup that's all we need to do now for the gun powerup we have a little bit more to talk about right if hit type equals gun then what are we gonna do well there's several things we have to do and because of that and because our last video went way too long I'm gonna go ahead and stop it here if you want to go ahead before watching the next video and see if you can start figuring out how we're gonna implement the gun powerup I recommend you try that and then you can watch the next video and see if we were thinking the same thing alright and I'll see you next time you
