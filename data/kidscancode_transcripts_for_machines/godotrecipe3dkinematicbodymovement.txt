welcome to another good Oh recipe in this video we're gonna look at the basics of kinematic body movement in 3d for this demo we're going to use this mini tank model which I found on each dot IO and you can get the link for that below just download this and unzip it in your project folder and when you do you're gonna see it contains some materials and an obj file now I'm going to click import I'm going to change it to import it as a scene and make the route type kinematic body so this is kinematic body and then click re import and that way when you click on the obj it'll say do you want to make an inherited scene yes we do alright now we have our tank now the only problem we have currently is that the tank model was saved with all of the meshes pointing in the positive Z direction but forward in Godot is the negative Z direction so so forward for our kinematic body is this way and I don't want everything to be backwards so I'm just gonna take each of these meshes there's three meshes that make up the tank there's the head or the turret there's the cannon and then there's the body there's also this extra mission since I'm not sure why that's there something from the obj so that one doesn't matter but these three all need to be transformed to rotate 180 degrees around Y so you do that to all three we will be pointing in the right direction relative to our kinematic bodies orientation okay and you can go ahead and save this and we're almost ready to go we're going to need a couple other nodes we're going to need a collision shape and for this I'm just going to use a box shape and we're just gonna size it to go on the turnoff snapping here we're gonna size this for the set for the part of the treads that touch the ground don't really care about the rest of it right now matching the body we could add another collision shape for you know collisions with walls and things like that but we're may only worried about movement so I just want to worry about the part that's on the ground we can actually make this you can make this thinner and drop it down but we want this to cover the ground part of the treads okay then the other thing we're going to add is we're gonna add a position 3d and this position 3d we're gonna call this cam pause this is gonna be a marker for where we want our camera to be and the easiest way to set this up is going to be to temporarily let's add a camera camera to this to this node and we will switch to two viewports set the camera to preview and then in this scene or in this view we can raise the camera up and put it behind see I'm moving the camera position not the camera because we're gonna delete that camera but I just want to put this somewhere up here where it's looking down and behind the tank this is the spot that we're gonna have our chase camera follow the tank and now we can go back to one of you port and delete this camera all right so that's our tank ready to go now we're ready to start working on the code all right so I've attached a script to the tank and I've started by defining some properties we've got gravity so that's how much is gonna be pulled downwards right so we want that pointing downwards and I gave it a scale of 10 we have speed this is how quickly the tank will move forward and back and rotation speed is how fast it's going to rotate when we press left and right the tank is going to rotate around its center by the treads moving in opposite directions and then we have a velocity which is our is going to be our movement vector and I've declared these with export because that makes them easy to edit in the inspector if you ever want to change these things export makes that convenient right a movement code is very simple and if you've used 2d kinematic bodies it's gonna look pretty much identical we're gonna add gravity to our down to our velocity gravity points downwards so that's gonna pull us downwards and then we're gonna call the kinematic bodies move and slide with an up vector defined and again we're using just like we did with down we're using the predefined constant for 0 comma 1 comma 0 now the only thing we need after this is we need to check which keys the player is pressing so we're gonna add a get input method which Renee to define and what this method does is going to check what Keys you're pressing now we want the tank to stop moving when we are not pressing any keys but that doesn't apply to gravity right gravity should always be accelerating us downwards if we go off a a ledge will fall downwards that kind of thing so we don't want to reset our velocity every frame right we're continuing it and maintaining it from frame to frame so that it can increase if it needs to but we do want to zero out the X and the Z directions because those are going to be what come from input so if we take the velocities out Y and we store it in a variable at the end we can set it back unchanged and then we can just zero out our velocity to vector 3.0 and worry about changing the x and z directions based on input so we're gonna have four possible inputs and here those are I've defined those in the input map forward back right and left which are going to be W and s a and D now what do we want to do when we press each of them when we press forward we want to move forward it doesn't mean we want to move in the negative Z globalaccess we want to move in the kinematic bodies negative zaxis so we want to take our velocity and we want to add the negative transform basis does e which is the local forward vector times speed and we do the same thing with back except it's not the negative direction and just in case that's not clear to you let's jump over to the 3d view again for a second now put us in global space mode now when the tank is pointing along the z axis then the tank moving forward is the same as moving along z axis but if the tank were to rotate and point this way we don't want to press forward and move this way right we want to move straight ahead and so you can visualize this if you turn on this button which local space local space shows you the tanks basis which is its Y X and z axes and now you can see even though we've turned 45 degrees to the right forward for the tank is still its negative zaxis it doesn't matter what direction I turn the tank in its local zaxis is going to be pointing the way we want it to point okay that's what we're doing in the code by using transform dub basis stud Z and then right on the left are going to be about rotating so we want to rotate around the y axis by our rotation speed now our rotation speed just positive or negative depending on which direction but just like with any other kind of movement it's always a good idea to use Delta here so that you will rotate at a consistent speed in frames depending on the frame rate but the problem is that Delta is not going to be defined in the input so when we call it we need to pass it all right then we can do this for both left and right which will be the opposite okay so now we have all four directions and that's all we need for our kinematic movement all right here's our test scene to try it out so I've made a mesh instance with a plain mesh and then used the create static body to give it a static body so it'll be solid then I've added a directional light just to give us a little bit of lighting in the scene so that's not so bland looking's without the light it looks pretty dull and then I've added an interpolated camera and the way the interpolated camera works is if we set its target and click here and choose the can pause and enable it then as this cam paws moves around right it's attached to the tank so the cam pause is gonna move it's gonna move with it and always be above and behind it the interpolated camera will move smoothly move to match that point if you move fast it'll slowly catch up if you move slowly it'll stay with it and that'll make it easy for us to see we're going so let's give it a shot if we run this scene there's our tank press forward the tank goes forward right and left tank rotates and you can see forward does what we want so that's all there is to it to making a simple basic starter kinematic controller in 3d and like I said before if you've done this in 2d you can see it's very very similar feel free to take a look there's some other recipes on the way of doing more with this tank like turning it into an actual tank that can rotate its turret and shoot being able to climb up and down terrain not just flat surfaces and things like that but those will be for other videos in the meantime thanks for watching I hope this was helpful and I'll see you in a future video this tutorial is part of my new Godot
