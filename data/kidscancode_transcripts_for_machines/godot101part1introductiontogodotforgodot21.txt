hi welcome to my new series Godot 101 this playlist will be an introduction to the Godot game engine and how it works if you've never used a game engine before or if you're just new to judo this is the place to start if you're new here a quick note about the channel name we're called kidskin code because I teach programming and game development to kids but if you're an adult you're welcome here to the material isn't dumbed down and we'll probably be challenging no matter what your age now let's get started so what is a game engine well many of you have probably heard of unity unity is the 500pound gorilla in the game industry many many companies big and small use it you've probably played unity games whether you realize it or not tons of people use it but it does have some drawbacks frankly I'm not a huge fan of it I think it's a little quirky and especially if you're trying to do 2d games and I enjoy making 2d games unity is not very good at doing it you know it's really 3d focused and the 2d stuff is kind of an afterthought which makes it difficult and there's tons of resources out there on unity unity is not free technically it's free until you make a certain amount of money so if you're using it just to make your own things yes you won't have to pay any money but it is a it is proprietary software and that's the way that that engine works what we're going to be talking about here is in these videos is the Godot engine like Godot is very similar in scope and in features and in all the stuff that it can do to unity the big upsides in my mind of Godot are one that it's free right as you can see right here on the webpage it's MIT license which means it's 100% open source and free you can download the source code to the engine you can change it however you want you can do whatever you want with it you will never ever have to pay a dollar to anyone for using it also it's really good at doing it does 3d great as well and we'll get into that too but it does 2d great right out of the box and like I said before you know for beginners when you're just getting started out with game development I really suggest you start with TV it's a lot less complicated than 3d and she's trying to work in 3d when you're just starting out you're really just fighting off more than you can chew and and it's going to be a lot harder and once you but once you get 2d you know under your belt and you're really solid with it stepping up to 3d will be a lot easier that also makes it a great choice because all the same tools and processes that you learn to use in doing 2d will be the same ones you use to make a game in 3d so the transition will be a lot easier so what is a game engine well it's kind of a loose term that gets used to mean a lot of different things by different people but in general a game engine is one that provides you a framework where you can focus on making the game and you don't have to write the code to do all the underlying things like in it you know like it says here has a rendering engine that's the thing that produces the graphics in 2d or 3d so you don't have to figure out how to calculate you know pixel movements and things like that it might have a physics engine in it so that you can hit handle collisions and realistic physics without having to write the code for that sounds animation networking all these kind of things are included in there and you just use them and put them together to make your game and there's lots of game engines out there with varying amounts of support for these different things and using different languages to write the code in and supporting different platforms for publishing your games that's another great thing about the dough is you can publish your game to just about any platform if you want to turn it into a web game if you want to distribute it on Linux PC Mac if you want to go mobile it supports iOS and Android and there are games out there on all those platforms that people have made indigo so it's definitely possible to put your game wherever you want it to go so before we start working with Godot let's talk about a couple of concepts and fundamentals to using Godot is the concept of nodes everything in Godot is a node and the node might be anything it might be a sprite it might be an animation it might be a sound but everything is a node and every node is going to have a name it's going to have all sorts of properties that define how it works and what it does it's going to have callback functions that means ways to make the node react to things you can send commands to the nodes have it do things and it's extendable meaning you can write code to make the Duce node do more things than it already does so everything is a node and nodes are arranged in what's called a tree and a tree just means that every node is going to have one parent only one parent and any node can have any number of children and they're arranged in this hierarchy so that you know this node here is a child of this node and this node is a child of this node and this would be at the top of the tree and so for example if you were to take a tree like this any tree of nodes grouped together in Godot is called a scene so here's an example of a scene we have a sprite that sprite has two children one is an animation node and one of them area 2d node that might be what something we're using to set up its physics and then that area to denote has a collision node that maybe says it's circular collision maybe has a shape and then maybe there's some other nodes attached to them altogether this makes a scene and so nodes and themes are fundamental to how you build everything in the dough okay so let's take a look at Godot when you first open it this is what you're going to see this is the project manager we're going to see a list of all the different Godot projects you might be working on and I've got a few here already that are going to be used for some upcoming videos but what you're going to want to do is going to want to click on new project and it's going to ask you first where you want to store this so if you hit browse you can be able to choose what folder to put your project in and I've been putting all of my stuff in a folder called game dev underscore Godot so I'm just going to click create folder and make one called test one for this example okay and it's going to make that folder and you're going to hit open alright that puts that here so now this is the place where it's going to save this and the name of it will be the same or different if you want to type something else and just hit create and then you'll see it added to the list and then anytime you want to open a project just click on it and click Edit this is what you're going to see when you first open a new project in Godot now it's easy to get overwhelmed at first because it's going to be a lot going on but for now we're going to keep it simple and just start with the basics this Center window here is your view of the game using the buttons at the top we can switch between 2d and 3d modes so let's click on 2d and stick with that for now okay over here on the right you're going to feel a box labeled scene remember we just learned that in Godot a scene is just a collection of nodes so let's add a node to this scene by clicking on the plus button here and you'll notice there's a tooltip there telling you what the button does and you can also see the keyboard shortcut mehta by the way just means command key if you're on Mac for the control key if you're on Windows so let's click that plus button so now we have this window asking us to choose what kind of node you want to create and as you can see there are a lot of notes and they all do different things and this is where you might start feeling overwhelmed going how am I ever going to learn how to use all of these things and what do they all mean so don't worry about that we're going to start small we're going to start with a few of them and over time you will start to use some of them and who knows what whatever game you're making you may not use some of these nodes you might not have any use for them so you can look through them and you can see they're kind of arranged in a hierarchy the green nodes are all about GUI functions about creating user interface the blue nodes here the bluish purple nodes are all about 2d nodes and then down here these reddish ones are all about 3d nodes and then there's a few miscellaneous ones down here that are in yellow and white but we don't need to worry about all that and you don't have to scroll through and find things either you can always just find the ones you want by clicking or by typing here so I'm going to type sprite and you see it's going to narrow down the search to all the nodes that have sprite in the name and this 2d sprite this is the one we want okay and so we're going to click create and now we have a sprite that has been created here in our scene and here in our game window we can see it's been put up here in the corner and you can grab the scroll bars and move over if you want to look at that part you can also I'm going to click with the middle mouse button and drag and that lets me just Pan my view around and look at different parts of the window you can zoom in by scrolling your mouse wheel in and out the sprite doesn't have really much going on because it doesn't look like anything so the first thing we knew is we need to give it an image now we don't have any images here yet but every new photo project has to be go icon in it and this is a little image file that we are going to use very popular for using in toriel dude it's already there so how do we set up our sprite well now it's time to look at the inspector tabs yes this window tells us we're looking at a sprite and this is all the information about it these are all the different settings that you can set on that sprite and to start with the one we care about is this one called texture right now it doesn't know because there's nothing in the texture property and you can click the down arrow here and there's some options here of things you can do so let's not worry about that what we're going to do is we're going to take this Widow icon and I'm going to drag it over here and drop it into that spot so now my sprite has this image as its texture and now let's grab that and we'll drag it out and put it in the middle of the scene because we don't want it to be up there in the corner and if I see them out here you can see this might be hard to see on the video but on your screen you should see this purple line that is going to be your game window when you run your game so let's put it somewhere in the middle here so that we'll see this right there we're ready to see what this will look like but if you notice up here it says unsaved well this hasn't been saved so we need to save this scene and if we click on scene here we can click save and you see the shortcut is meta F so I'm just going to hit command F and it's going to ask me to save it and it's going to give it a suggested filename right dot C SCN which is fine for us dot T SC n is the extension that all the Godot scenes are going to be putting at the end you can use other ones but definitely stick with that one we'll get more into that later and just click Save so now this is saved it has a name sprite scene and we can try it out this button right here it looks like a movie clapper with a play icon on it if I hover just play the edited scene so that's just going to play the scene that we have open right now if I click it this is what pops up so there is our test game with our sprites in the center of the screen ok thanks for watching I hope you're as excited to learn about Godot as I am to be teaching you I'm going to be making a bunch of good old videos coming up so please like and subscribe so you can see them as soon as they're released if you have a few dollars to spare please consider my patreon page it really does help keep the videos coming see you next time
