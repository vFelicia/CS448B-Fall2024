welcome back to learning to code with Python lesson eight number guessing game let's use what we've learned so far to make a simple guessing game the computer is going to think of a random number and the player will try to guess it when the guess is made the computer will tell the player if they were too high to low or guess just right now before we start let's talk about what the steps that we need to take are so step one is the computer needs to pick a random number you don't have to type this stuff this is just going to be for us to look at while we're making our program so the second step will be that the player makes a guess right and then step three is we compare the guess to the number right and then step four is we say or we'll say we print out two high to low or you got it okay so those are basically our steps for the program so let's start with step one we need to pick a random number well we haven't done that before so we're going to need some new commands so in order to use the random number commands we're going to need to import random then we can pick a random number so let's call it secret that's what I'll name the variable and the secret number will just be a random number and we want to decide maybe between one and a hundred so the command to do that is random dot R and range and then inside the parentheses of R and range you put the two numbers you want the random number to be between so we want to put one and one hundred and one that'll give us a random number between 1 and 100 remember R and range works just like when we did the counting loops it counts up to but not including this number this is where it stops so this will pick a number between 1 and 100 and for now let's go ahead and print out secrets so we can see what number we picked obviously we don't want the player to cheat so when we finish the game we're not going to keep this print in here but let's keep it there for now so that we can see what happened okay now I'm going to save this and I'll call it secret and let's go ahead and run it and see what happens there we go our secret number was 56 and you'll see if we run it again we should get a different number every time okay that's step one done now we need step two the player needs to make a guess well just like in the last lesson we need to use the input function so let's call the let's call the variable guess that will hold the value of whatever the player types in and then we'll use the input and we'll ask make a guess now remember we want this guess value to be a number so that we can compare it to the secret number we don't want it to be a string so we need to use that int function we talked about last time to make sure it's a number okay so that's step two step three and four kind of go together so we'll do those at the same time so first to compare guests to number we need to say if guess is greater than secret then we want it to print to high then can say L if guess is less than secret so if it's not greater than let's check to see if it's less than if it's less than then we want to print to low and then finally if it wasn't too high and it wasn't too low that only leaves one option right they must have gotten it right so let's give it a try now we know what our secret is so we can test and see if our tests are working so I'm going to guess 45 and it should say too high good now notice the program is not running anymore it's ended because we're only going through here one time so the player only gets one chance to make a guess and we'll fix that in a minute but for right now if we want to try again we're going to need to run the program again and I want to run it two more times so I can try each case and make sure that my program is working the way I want it to so we're going to go ahead and run it one more time this time the secret is 24 so I'm going to guess 12 because that's lower and it said too low good now one more try and we're going to guess correct this time to make sure it says you got it excellent so now our tests are working right and we're saying the right thing but you only get one guess if you don't know the secret already that doesn't make the game very fun so what we really want to do is let the player keep trying and making another guess until they get it right so how do we do that well we don't want to use a counting loop like we've done before because we don't know how many guesses the player might take to get it they might get it in a small number of guesses or it might take them a lot so we want to use a loop that just goes until they get it right so that's not a counting loop that's a kind of loop called a conditional loop and here's what a conditional loop looks like so what parts of this program do we want to repeat well we want to repeat the parts that I've highlighted here we want the player to make a guess we print out what the result was and then we do that again let them make another guess print out what the result was so this is the parts that we want to repeat so what we're going to do is right before guess we're going to say while guess is not equal to secret that's what a conditional loop looks like we use the command while to say this is a loop that's going to happen while this part whatever this says is true so as long as guess is not equal to secret comes out true this loop will keep going but now all of this code needs to be indented so that's part of the while loop so what I'm going to do is highlight it all and press tab so it shifts it over so now all this code will repeat inside this while loop and then as soon as guess is equal to secret this part will be false so the loop will end so let's try running it and see what happens we got an error look what the error says it says the name guess is not defined when it tried to do the while loop so right here in our code we're getting an error can you see why let's think about what happens as the computer comes down from the top and picks a secret and then it gets here and it says well guess is not equal to secret well guess is not equal to anything yet guess doesn't exist we've never made a variable called guess yet so how can it compare guess to secret it doesn't know what it is so what we need to do is we need to give guests an initial value a starting value that the program begins with so it has something to compare so before this loop starts we need to set guess equal to something well I don't want to set it equal to the secret so I don't want to pick a number between 1 and 100 because what if the secret was 33 and 9 33 so let's set guess equal to zero okay and zero is not in this range so there's no way the secret can be zero so that means the first time the computer comes down here sets guests to zero is zero equal to the secret no it won't be so the loop will happen at least once and give the chance for a player to enter a guess all right let's run the program and see what happens all right so the secret number is 70 or we're still cheating and printing out what the secret is we're gonna have to change that in a minute but let's go ahead and make sure it's letting me try over and over again so if I guess 40 that's too low if I guess 80 that's too high and if I guess 70 you got it and now the program ends so now we have everything working the way we want let's go ahead and add one more thing so first I'm going to remove this print secret line I don't want to print out the secret anymore I want to actually play the game okay and now I want to add one more thing I'd like to keep track of how many times the player guessed so they can have a score at the end to do that we're going to need another variable to keep track of the number of guesses so let's make that up here at the beginning we need to give it an initial value to what does it start with well the number of guesses should start at zero all right we haven't made any yet we'll call it tries so this will keep track of how many times I tried to answer the question so we want to add one two tries every time the player makes a guess so we can do that right here right after they make a guess we can say take tries and now set it equal to tries plus one if we run this program right now everything will work and tries will go up by one every time we make a guess but at the end of the game we won't see what our score was because we're never printing it out anywhere so down here at the bottom after this while loop ends so after we've finished guessing and we've gotten it right is where we want to print out the score so we don't want to indent here because we don't want this to be part of the loop we want it to happen after the loop is done and we just want to print out we'll say number of tries tries so let's run it now and see what happens okay no secret I don't know what the secret is so I'm going to guess 50 well 50 was too high so how about if I guess 30 30 is too low we'll try 40 we'll try 35 we'll try 38 37 I got it and I got it in six tries and now's a good time to go ahead and check and make sure that the program is counting correctly was it really six tries 1 2 3 4 5 6 ok it's working right it's always a good idea to double check and make sure you didn't make a mistake somewhere near program and the number comes out wrong and that's the number guessing game see you next time you
