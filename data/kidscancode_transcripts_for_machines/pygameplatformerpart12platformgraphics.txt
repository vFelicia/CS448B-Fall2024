welcome back to game development with pygame this is part 12 of our platformer development series and in this video we will be adding platformer graphics so now we're ready to change our platform to start using some of these graphics and I'm going to use this dirt and grass one and I'm gonna use both of the sizes there's a wide one and a narrow one so that means we're gonna have to make some changes to our platform sprite one of the changes is we are not going to need the width and height to be specified but we are going to pass a copy of the game like we did up here in class player so that we can reference the sprite sheet so we're gonna say soft a game of this game okay and then I'm gonna make a list of the two images that I want to use and I'm actually gonna I'm going to paste this in here cuz I've already gone and looked up these are the coordinates from the XML file if you want to use some different ones here or you even want to use more of them you can put more of them into this list because our image is just going to be a random choice from that list of images which means we're going to need to go up here I'm going to be important random so that we can say random dot choice images now since we're actually only using choice another way we could do this and you'll see this a lot in Python is we can just say from random import choice so that since that's the only command we're gonna be using we can just say choice and then we're not going to fill with green anymore but we do need to set the color key to black just like we did with the other sprites so that will do it for class platform but now our problem is going to be over here where we and knew where we spawn the platform's okay so we know we're gonna need to pass a copy of the game but now we're getting our list of coordinates from our platform list here which has X Y width and height nip the width and height are going to be invalid now because we don't have that many options in our sprite so I'm gonna take out these width and Heights so that we don't have them in there okay now if we go over here we should see oh I forgot there's one other place where we spawn platforms and that's if there's any of the need to be spawned up above the top so that one again we're also going to take out the width and height and we are gonna add in that we want to pass the game so now I should see this yes and now we're spawning some new platforms that we can see so much nicer now now notice how when I'm up here I jump to a higher platform the screen isn't always scrolling the way I wanted to see if I can get that to happen a good example there we go see I was on this platform and I snapped up to this one but the screen isn't scrolling because my velocity right now is zero if I jump a little bit it's gonna snap down there so we'd like to make that a little more smooth so what we can do here is in this section right here where we detect whether we need to scroll the screen we're moving everything at the players velocity but since I snapped up to that platform at my velocity is zero so that's why we're not screw so what we're gonna do is we're going to say use the max function and I'm gonna say use either that or the number two so whichever number is bigger the players velocity or two it's going to scroll at and we can do that here for the moving of the platforms too and what that's gonna do is give us a little let's get a little snap to happen so you might notice even when the player snaps up there and the players not moving anymore the screen will scroll for us at a nice little steady pace and I think that's okay for now we can definitely improve that but that can wait all right a couple of other things you might be noticing one is responding up here at the top and I'd like to spawn down here at my first platform which might be a big one might be a small one I actually want to move it up a little bit too because they can't see the bottom of it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over here to our settings we're gonna change this first platform to move it up just a little bit 50 let's see what that looks like yeah there may be slightly more there we go okay so I'd like the player I like the player to spawn on that platform down here so I just want to change the player sprites spawn location so in here we're spawning at the center of the screen right now so we're gonna make this I'm just picking what I think is going to be a reasonable number we'll see what that looks like when I run it what do we do there oh right I need to do that in the position not because the position is where we're gonna get set to anyway so there we go so a we spawn down here on top of things and that's okay now another thing you might notice if you're playing around is occasionally the jump doesn't seem to work you'll press it and a jump won't happen and the reason that's happening is well there's a couple of things that have to do with it but one thing we can do to make that a little more reliable is if we go to our players jump method here I'm gonna change these numbers to two so instead of checking the pixel right below us we're gonna check two pixels below us before we jump and that's gonna make it a little more reliable reliably detect the platform underneath the players feet okay now we are still snapping to these platforms quite a lot especially you might have noticed also sometimes we're behind the platforms there's a lot of little things to clean up now that we've changed things so let's clean up a couple of them and then we'll be done for this video one thing I want to do is here in my draw section so I'm actually going to make sure I want to make sure the player is on top so I'm gonna actually blitt the player on top of the rest of the sprites that way the the player will always be in the front okay so we should never see the player disappear or hide behind a platform okay now we have we're gonna have to decide what to do about some of this interaction with the booth platforms right I mean like this example if I walked to the right and I snap up to the top of it that's okay but some of these situations like should I snap to the top there or should I not go until I jump and what about when the platforms are right on top of each other like this you know you're gonna get it sometimes I snap something they don't it's a little bit inconsistent wasn't so much a problem when they were a little rectangles because it's hard to tell but sometimes it looks a little weird okay and that's okay because we can fix that and we can do some more smarter things about our collisions but that's going to wait for a later video we've already gone over a little over ten minutes so we're gonna stop there for today and I will see you in the next video if you have any questions or comments please post them in the discussion area below and also please click like on the video that actually helps other people find it and get the word out thanks a lot and I'll see you next time you
