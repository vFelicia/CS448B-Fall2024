00:01 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:03 - today i am going to be giving you a
00:04 - brief overview on seabourn
00:06 - and today just a special announcement is
00:08 - that i have a new camera
00:10 - um and hopefully it records my face
00:11 - better my last one was my webcam on my
00:14 - laptop and it wasn't as good as this one
00:16 - this one's like a
00:18 - camera so yeah hopefully the quality is
00:21 - better
00:22 - and my face isn't that gray anymore so
00:24 - let's begin
00:25 - so first let's open command prompt or
00:27 - cmd
00:29 - and then um if you don't have seaborne
00:31 - yet then make sure to pip
00:32 - install cbone first because that is a
00:35 - library we're going to be using today
00:38 - once you did that um if you already have
00:41 - it it will come up requirement already
00:42 - satisfied
00:43 - but if you don't then it should be
00:45 - installing packages right now
00:46 - and once you're done with installing
00:48 - seaborn make sure to pip
00:50 - install matplotlib also because that's
00:53 - also another library we're going to be
00:55 - using
00:57 - once you have pip installed both of
00:59 - these then what we want to do
01:01 - is you want to type in jupyter notebook
01:04 - like so we should open our jupyter
01:07 - notebook
01:08 - into a browser like this and um since i
01:12 - already prepared my notebook
01:14 - uh i will go into my file but if you
01:16 - don't then just click new
01:17 - python 3 ipy kernel and then this will
01:20 - create a new notebook for you to use
01:25 - now your notebook shouldn't look too
01:26 - much like mine since i already wrote
01:28 - code in it
01:29 - but what you want to do first is you
01:30 - want to rename your notebook to
01:32 - something according to this lesson
01:34 - such as basic seaborn ep3
01:38 - now once we're done with this the first
01:39 - thing we're going to be doing is we're
01:41 - going to import our libraries we're
01:42 - going to be using
01:43 - which is cborn as sns and import
01:46 - matplotlib.pi plot as plt
01:48 - these import ads will basically shorten
01:51 - down the name
01:52 - of these libraries so whenever we want
01:54 - to use them
01:55 - we don't have to type out their whole
01:57 - name we just need to type out sns and
01:59 - plt
02:01 - after that make sure to have percent
02:03 - sign matplotlib
02:04 - inline this will basically allow us to
02:08 - show graphs and be able to visualize
02:10 - your data
02:11 - this code is used to display all of the
02:15 - possible data sets we can be using
02:17 - seaborne has
02:19 - already pre-made data sets for us to use
02:21 - so this will display
02:22 - what there are sorry i forgot to p um
02:25 - import
02:26 - okay we need to wait until it connects
02:28 - to our notebook really quick
02:30 - and there we go so there is a bunch of
02:32 - them that we're gonna
02:33 - that we could use but i will use the
02:36 - penguins one since it is
02:37 - the one that is the most fun for me and
02:40 - the one is
02:41 - that is most usable um so yeah that's
02:43 - why i'm going to be using the penguins
02:44 - one today
02:45 - also once we did that we got to store
02:47 - the penguin dataset inside a variable so
02:50 - i made a variable called pens
02:51 - and with the code sns.loaddataset
02:54 - penguins
02:54 - i am able to restore all the information
02:57 - into the variable
02:58 - and now this is what the first five rows
03:00 - of the variable looks like
03:02 - inside of each row there's going to be
03:04 - one two three four
03:06 - five six seven there are seven columns
03:08 - the first column is the species
03:10 - there's three species in total the deli
03:12 - the shin strap and the gen two
03:14 - and the island i don't know about the
03:16 - island but um
03:18 - it just tells you where the penguins
03:19 - live and then there is the bill length
03:21 - the build depth the flipper length and
03:23 - the body mass
03:24 - the build length is how long the bill is
03:26 - or the mouth
03:27 - and the build depth is how deep it is or
03:30 - the deepness of the mouth and the
03:32 - flipper length is how long the foot are
03:35 - and the body mass is how heavy the
03:37 - penguin is
03:38 - and the gender is what um are they
03:41 - either boy or girl or male or female
03:43 - and um in here we're going to be looking
03:45 - at lm plot
03:46 - lm plot is a way to visualize your data
03:50 - it's a plot
03:51 - and um it looks somewhat like this so we
03:54 - can see a bunch of blue dots and a line
03:56 - this line is called the regression line
03:58 - or the average and
03:59 - all the dots are resembling the bill
04:01 - length and the build depth
04:03 - i forgot to go over this code but
04:04 - basically what it is is it sets the
04:06 - x-axis
04:07 - and then the y-axis do something else
04:09 - and it sets what data we're going to be
04:11 - using in this case we're going to be
04:13 - using our pen
04:14 - data set or our penguin data set however
04:16 - we can't really tell
04:17 - which one is what right so with the
04:20 - command
04:21 - sns.lm plot x equals build length y
04:24 - equals build length
04:25 - i mean x equals build depth y equals
04:27 - spell length data equals to pen palette
04:29 - equals cool warm and hue equals the
04:31 - species
04:31 - we are able to um have more detail
04:35 - in what it is so here is a legion on the
04:37 - side
04:38 - and the blue resembles the deli so we
04:40 - can see the deli over here
04:42 - the chin strap is the white and gentoo
04:44 - is orange and you can customize it to
04:46 - look somewhat like this
04:47 - or make it more detailed you can also
04:49 - change the color using the
04:51 - command palette to cool and warm and the
04:53 - hue to species which makes it
04:55 - differentiate between each species
04:59 - you can even go further but i will be
05:01 - only showing you that today
05:02 - since there is already a lot of good
05:05 - tutorials on
05:07 - customizing lm plots let's move on to
05:09 - the next one which is comparing grids
05:11 - um this basically will create multiple
05:14 - of these grids
05:15 - but in uh you might have noticed over
05:17 - here they're all cramped into
05:18 - one grid but we're gonna divide through
05:21 - all three of them
05:22 - into a three individual grid
05:25 - so what we're gonna do is we're going to
05:27 - have uh at the end
05:28 - call which stands for columns equals to
05:31 - species this will
05:32 - uh create three grids for each one as
05:34 - you can see all of them are divided
05:36 - there's the deli mission strap and the
05:38 - gen 2. let's move on to the style so
05:40 - we're going to be moving on from lm plot
05:43 - and now we're going to be using the
05:44 - count plot
05:45 - the count plot is a bit different since
05:46 - you only need to set the x
05:48 - coordinate not the y and the y
05:51 - coordinate
05:52 - is the count so let's see what it does
05:55 - and you can see here
05:56 - since we set our x coordinates to be
05:58 - species there's a deletion strap and
06:00 - gentoo
06:01 - and the count is how much penguins there
06:03 - are so
06:04 - the deli has 145 around penguins
06:07 - the shin strap has 60 around ish and the
06:09 - gen 2 has around 120 penguins
06:12 - and that is the count plot uh we can
06:15 - also
06:15 - set the background for the account plot
06:17 - such as the dark grid the dark grid um
06:20 - basically sets the background for us and
06:22 - make it more
06:23 - uh customizable so we can see here that
06:26 - there is a grayish
06:27 - darkish background um
06:30 - we can also see an assortment of
06:31 - backgrounds so if we were to do shift
06:34 - tab we can look in here and we can click
06:37 - plus
06:38 - and then scroll down to here now there
06:40 - is a list of
06:42 - commands or styles we can use right now
06:46 - i will be using the white one since i
06:47 - will show you
06:48 - some something in down this code that
06:50 - requires the white one
06:51 - so if we set it to white it would look
06:53 - something somewhat like the original
06:56 - um and if you don't want these two
06:58 - borders right here
06:59 - then you can do sns count plot x equals
07:02 - the species
07:03 - data equals to pen sns.dspine this will
07:06 - remove
07:07 - these two lines right here
07:10 - so now those two are removed if you want
07:12 - to remove both of these
07:13 - what you want to do is left which is the
07:16 - y-axis
07:17 - and the bottom is the x-axis so
07:20 - pretend you only want to remove the
07:22 - y-axis then you make
07:24 - bottom equals to false or you don't even
07:26 - have the code
07:27 - like this and now the bottom one is not
07:29 - removed however if you want to remove
07:31 - both of them
07:32 - then you can do left equal to true and
07:34 - bottom equals to true
07:36 - now all the lines are removed we can
07:38 - also change the size of our plot
07:41 - and if i want to be bigger then i will
07:43 - make it 15 by 5
07:45 - and this will make our uh our plot
07:48 - considerably bigger
07:50 - like so and if we only want the font to
07:53 - get bigger and not
07:54 - the actual plot then we can just do
07:58 - font scale equals to 1.2
08:01 - now you can see that the plot or the
08:03 - plot the graphs
08:05 - are the same but just the font has been
08:08 - increased
08:09 - so we can play around with the settings
08:11 - but that is it
08:12 - and all i have for you today i hope you
08:14 - enjoyed this video see you the next one
08:16 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i am going to be giving you a brief overview on seabourn and today just a special announcement is that i have a new camera um and hopefully it records my face better my last one was my webcam on my laptop and it wasn't as good as this one this one's like a camera so yeah hopefully the quality is better and my face isn't that gray anymore so let's begin
