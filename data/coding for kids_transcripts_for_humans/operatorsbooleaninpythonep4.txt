00:00 - my name is jimmy and today i'm going to
00:01 - be showing you some functions
00:04 - of um operators and or
00:07 - not and i'm going to be showing you um
00:10 - true or false uh so like one
00:14 - is more than two is that true or false
00:16 - false right
00:17 - so i'm going to show you how to do that
00:18 - in python first of all let's start off
00:21 - with true or false
00:22 - now in here it's pretty interesting
00:24 - because you can change it to different
00:26 - ways
00:26 - okay so let me just show you um how the
00:29 - basics of it first
00:31 - so here x
00:35 - equals to one
00:40 - one more than two
00:43 - right and then we do print
00:47 - x does do you think that this
00:50 - is going to be true or false false right
00:53 - okay
00:55 - false there we go false which means that
00:58 - it's false so yeah this is the simple
01:01 - basics of it
01:02 - what if we do something interesting what
01:05 - if we
01:06 - put an input and stuff okay let's see
01:10 - let's um use our technique from our last
01:12 - video which is inputs
01:14 - to apply to this project so let me first
01:16 - of all remember to name your project or
01:18 - else you're gonna get confused
01:19 - so let me just name this uh
01:22 - true slash false okay
01:26 - now after this let's just uh say
01:29 - something like
01:30 - input input
01:35 - and then type a question like is
01:39 - one greater than
01:43 - two and then question mark
01:46 - boom bam like that and then they'll have
01:49 - to answer it
01:50 - and once they answer it we just print
01:54 - out and they can check by themselves if
01:55 - it's correct so
01:57 - like this and then print
02:02 - and then wait let's just put x up here x
02:06 - 1 greater than
02:09 - two put that equal sign okay
02:13 - and then print the
02:17 - answer is
02:20 - oh wait let's just say print
02:23 - x there we go let's just see what it
02:25 - does okay
02:27 - it runs is one greater than two let's
02:29 - just say
02:31 - uh true how about true okay
02:34 - they'll say it's false which means that
02:37 - the correct answer is false
02:39 - so yeah it's pretty fun you can change
02:41 - it to a bunch of different stuff
02:42 - just to remember to change this one too
02:45 - and yeah that's true or false pretty
02:47 - simple
02:47 - right if you um want to know if this
02:51 - will work
02:52 - then we could change it
02:55 - this way less okay sorry for hitting the
02:58 - microphone it might be a little loud
03:00 - it's one less than two true
03:04 - yeah it's correct see so yeah that's
03:07 - true or false
03:08 - now moving for the second one is
03:10 - operators for
03:12 - um and or and not
03:15 - so um there's three operators as i said
03:18 - before
03:20 - and or
03:23 - and not let me explain them first and
03:28 - if there's a false and true right
03:31 - then if you combine the false and true
03:33 - and we'll say
03:35 - that it's false okay so if there's
03:38 - false and true combined it's false
03:41 - but if it's false and false combined
03:45 - false true and true true okay that's and
03:49 - for or if there's um a
03:52 - true and false it's going to say it's
03:54 - true
03:55 - okay so there's x and y okay pretend and
03:58 - x is true
03:58 - y is false and then um x
04:01 - or y and then it says it's true
04:05 - if it's both wrong both false then it's
04:08 - false
04:09 - both true then it's true not if it's
04:11 - true
04:12 - it's false if it's false it's true
04:15 - simple right
04:16 - okay now moving on i'm going to show you
04:18 - how to use it in code
04:20 - so in here we can do like
04:23 - x equals to 10 um
04:27 - no x equals to 10
04:30 - and 10 greater than two
04:33 - okay and then print
04:38 - x first right okay
04:42 - sorry for hitting the microphone x and
04:44 - then let's just comment all of these
04:47 - okay there we go and then um here
04:51 - we will probably see a true
04:54 - okay true yes true however if we put
05:00 - in front of print not x
05:03 - let's see not
05:07 - okay okay sorry wrong place
05:10 - right here okay
05:13 - no that would mean it's a variable name
05:15 - hmm
05:16 - where do i put it again uh
05:20 - print no i don't think you need print
05:23 - for this one right
05:25 - not x
05:28 - oh oh no no i figured it out z
05:32 - equals to not x so we print
05:38 - z huh i'm smart you know
05:41 - okay let's see false there we go and
05:44 - that's how you
05:45 - invert or as you can say outward
05:48 - um a true into a false however if we
05:51 - switch it around like
05:53 - this it should become a true
05:56 - even though this is false but it's
05:59 - revert the x
06:00 - and then print the z which is revert x's
06:03 - which means that it's going to be true
06:05 - let's look true as we can see that's the
06:08 - basic
06:09 - operator of not let's change it
06:12 - okay so
06:16 - let's say that this
06:20 - is false right guys this is false right
06:23 - because 10
06:23 - is greater than 2 but this is 10 is less
06:26 - than 2. so
06:26 - x is false how about we create of y
06:30 - y equals 2
06:33 - 2 is
06:36 - greater no less than you can put them
06:39 - together if you want
06:40 - less than 10 what about this and then
06:43 - we're going to print
06:45 - y whoops parentheses
06:48 - y parentheses and then you say and
06:52 - y and x and then print z so
06:56 - false as i said before and if you have a
06:59 - true and false
07:01 - combining together is going to be false
07:03 - okay
07:04 - however if you have a true and true
07:05 - combined it's going to be true
07:08 - okay let's see if we can revert this
07:12 - okay like that true
07:15 - 2 is less than 10 oops
07:19 - and then 10 is greater than 2
07:22 - there now it should be true
07:28 - and it's true there we go guys now for
07:31 - um both false as we know it's going to
07:33 - be
07:35 - false so 10 is less than
07:38 - 2 and 2 is
07:42 - greater than 10. now it's gonna be false
07:46 - okay here false there we go we're
07:49 - getting to
07:50 - you're getting the hang of it right it's
07:52 - pretty simple um however if we do an
07:54 - or and one of them is true
07:59 - okay then it's going to be um true okay
08:03 - look
08:04 - true there we go because this y is true
08:08 - and x is false however for or
08:11 - if one of them is false then um
08:15 - and one of them is false one of them is
08:16 - true then it's true
08:18 - okay however if um one of them is true
08:22 - the other one is
08:23 - true then it's true false false is false
08:26 - okay let me just demonstrate it
08:30 - so now the now this
08:34 - is both false okay
08:37 - so if we click it it should be false
08:39 - false there we go
08:41 - now let's do both true
08:45 - less than and then go up here
08:48 - and then there now let's play
08:52 - true see because both of them are true
08:55 - nice
08:56 - now let's do oh we're done actually
09:00 - so that was pretty simple guys it's the
09:02 - lesson for today
09:03 - true and false and operators so i hope
09:06 - you found something helpful in this
09:08 - lesson
09:09 - uh something useful and you can apply to
09:11 - your project
09:12 - um so yeah i'll see you next episode
09:16 - bye i hope you found something useful

Cleaned transcript:

my name is jimmy and today i'm going to be showing you some functions of um operators and or not and i'm going to be showing you um true or false uh so like one is more than two is that true or false false right so i'm going to show you how to do that in python first of all let's start off with true or false now in here it's pretty interesting because you can change it to different ways okay so let me just show you um how the basics of it first so here x equals to one one more than two right and then we do print x does do you think that this is going to be true or false false right okay false there we go false which means that it's false so yeah this is the simple basics of it what if we do something interesting what if we put an input and stuff okay let's see let's um use our technique from our last video which is inputs to apply to this project so let me first of all remember to name your project or else you're gonna get confused so let me just name this uh true slash false okay now after this let's just uh say something like input input and then type a question like is one greater than two and then question mark boom bam like that and then they'll have to answer it and once they answer it we just print out and they can check by themselves if it's correct so like this and then print and then wait let's just put x up here x 1 greater than two put that equal sign okay and then print the answer is oh wait let's just say print x there we go let's just see what it does okay it runs is one greater than two let's just say uh true how about true okay they'll say it's false which means that the correct answer is false so yeah it's pretty fun you can change it to a bunch of different stuff just to remember to change this one too and yeah that's true or false pretty simple right if you um want to know if this will work then we could change it this way less okay sorry for hitting the microphone it might be a little loud it's one less than two true yeah it's correct see so yeah that's true or false now moving for the second one is operators for um and or and not so um there's three operators as i said before and or and not let me explain them first and if there's a false and true right then if you combine the false and true and we'll say that it's false okay so if there's false and true combined it's false but if it's false and false combined false true and true true okay that's and for or if there's um a true and false it's going to say it's true okay so there's x and y okay pretend and x is true y is false and then um x or y and then it says it's true if it's both wrong both false then it's false both true then it's true not if it's true it's false if it's false it's true simple right okay now moving on i'm going to show you how to use it in code so in here we can do like x equals to 10 um no x equals to 10 and 10 greater than two okay and then print x first right okay sorry for hitting the microphone x and then let's just comment all of these okay there we go and then um here we will probably see a true okay true yes true however if we put in front of print not x let's see not okay okay sorry wrong place right here okay no that would mean it's a variable name hmm where do i put it again uh print no i don't think you need print for this one right not x oh oh no no i figured it out z equals to not x so we print z huh i'm smart you know okay let's see false there we go and that's how you invert or as you can say outward um a true into a false however if we switch it around like this it should become a true even though this is false but it's revert the x and then print the z which is revert x's which means that it's going to be true let's look true as we can see that's the basic operator of not let's change it okay so let's say that this is false right guys this is false right because 10 is greater than 2 but this is 10 is less than 2. so x is false how about we create of y y equals 2 2 is greater no less than you can put them together if you want less than 10 what about this and then we're going to print y whoops parentheses y parentheses and then you say and y and x and then print z so false as i said before and if you have a true and false combining together is going to be false okay however if you have a true and true combined it's going to be true okay let's see if we can revert this okay like that true 2 is less than 10 oops and then 10 is greater than 2 there now it should be true and it's true there we go guys now for um both false as we know it's going to be false so 10 is less than 2 and 2 is greater than 10. now it's gonna be false okay here false there we go we're getting to you're getting the hang of it right it's pretty simple um however if we do an or and one of them is true okay then it's going to be um true okay look true there we go because this y is true and x is false however for or if one of them is false then um and one of them is false one of them is true then it's true okay however if um one of them is true the other one is true then it's true false false is false okay let me just demonstrate it so now the now this is both false okay so if we click it it should be false false there we go now let's do both true less than and then go up here and then there now let's play true see because both of them are true nice now let's do oh we're done actually so that was pretty simple guys it's the lesson for today true and false and operators so i hope you found something helpful in this lesson uh something useful and you can apply to your project um so yeah i'll see you next episode bye i hope you found something useful
