00:00 - hello everybody my name is Jimmy and
00:01 - today I will be showing you how you can
00:03 - make your own python bot that will
00:04 - automate your games for you so for
00:07 - example this aim trainer right here if I
00:09 - were to play it by myself as you can see
00:11 - I have horrible aim I cannot even press
00:13 - it and uh in order to fix this I decided
00:17 - to make my own python bot that can
00:20 - easily do like this which is to track
00:23 - all the dots for you and even if I'm
00:28 - pretending to be the body self or blame
00:29 - anyway is this you can automate your
00:31 - games using this python bot which would
00:33 - track objects and click it for example
00:36 - like uh like Resort like not Resort
00:39 - games like mobile games those on where
00:42 - you have to press people in order to
00:44 - collect money or something uh it you can
00:46 - use it for a variety of things and
00:48 - today's is going to be episode one which
00:49 - is where I'm going to lay out the basics
00:51 - and teach you some of like um how to
00:53 - install stuff and the basics of python
00:56 - basically if you don't want to if you
00:58 - already know how to do these things you
00:59 - don't have to to do it for example in
01:01 - this video I'm going to be uh talking
01:03 - about printing IFL statements
01:06 - concatenation commenting different types
01:08 - of variables and math and python as well
01:10 - as arrays so if you don't if you already
01:12 - know all these things then you can go
01:13 - ahead and skip to the next episode where
01:16 - I might be making I might be starting to
01:17 - make a bot or I might still be laying
01:19 - out some Basics but anyways let's get
01:21 - started first things first let's go
01:23 - ahead and install Visual Studio codes
01:25 - which is where we're going to be uh
01:26 - which is what we're going to be using to
01:28 - code it's a python editor which means me
01:30 - that it edit python so let's go ahead
01:32 - search that Visual Studio code like that
01:37 - go to download right here and then
01:39 - download for Windows uh I'm not using a
01:41 - Mac or Linux so I don't know if it will
01:44 - work the same way as Windows but anyways
01:46 - just press this big blue button okay and
01:49 - now once you press in here it's going to
01:51 - ask you to set up press save all right
01:55 - now just open it
01:56 - up uh I accept next just press next next
02:01 - wait okay next and then in here yeah
02:04 - just press next all right neck and
02:06 - install like that and that's it wait for
02:09 - it to install and then we're
02:18 - done all right after it's done
02:20 - installing we just press finish and it
02:22 - opens up okay once we've got to this
02:25 - welcome menu right here we're going to
02:26 - go to our extensions and we're going to
02:28 - search for pyth
02:30 - well I I already searched it up
02:32 - beforehand but if you didn't search
02:34 - python press enter Then you see the
02:37 - first thing comes up this one press
02:39 - install I already have it installed so
02:41 - mine comes up uninstall and after you're
02:43 - done installing python you want to go to
02:45 - here and search python
02:46 - indent like so is this guy press on it
02:50 - and press install this will basically
02:52 - make it a lot easier for you to type
02:53 - python as you can see it just
02:54 - automatically indents it for you which
02:56 - is a lot easier than having to tab press
02:59 - tab so yeah let's go back to our
03:02 - Explorer all
03:04 - right okay now let's go create go ahead
03:06 - and create a file control n okay let's
03:09 - close these two up I'm going to save
03:11 - this into a folder which I'll know how
03:13 - to do coding Python and let's just make
03:17 - our uh python robot python
03:20 - bot all right and I'll save this as
03:24 - uh part one. py make sure it's py or
03:28 - else it won't work okay
03:30 - now we can use control+ to zoom in it's
03:33 - bit too much all right there all right
03:35 - once we zoomed in we're going to now
03:37 - start our coding so first things first
03:40 - what we want to do let me close this up
03:42 - is printing so printing is quite simple
03:44 - actually all we got to do is print hello
03:47 - world this is the probably the easiest
03:48 - command in all of programming in order
03:51 - to run this we press control B no that's
03:53 - that's for Sublime Text we press over
03:56 - here uh and oh I think we got to go go
03:59 - here first first then
04:01 - choose where is it editor no wait do we
04:04 - select python yeah just python PR oh
04:07 - python not installed what I already inst
04:11 - python all
04:14 - right it looks like I haven't installed
04:16 - python on this computer which is kind of
04:20 - weird oh maybe it's because I factory
04:22 - res my computer like a few weeks ago
04:25 - that's why I don't have python but
04:28 - anyways okay I'll download python while
04:30 - we're
04:34 - waiting all right now python is
04:36 - installed uh so yeah let's go ahead and
04:38 - try it
04:40 - again uhoh that one there you go I press
04:45 - play as you can see it now works hello
04:48 - world all right that's our basic print
04:50 - command I'm going to actually make a
04:52 - little heading going be
04:55 - print print okay uh and in printing we
04:59 - we can do a lot of stuff with it we can
05:01 - do a lot of things with it Bas actually
05:03 - so let's take for example print a
05:06 - variable so we're going to set uh x
05:09 - equals
05:10 - to in strings rabbit like that we can
05:14 - say print X and it will say
05:17 - rabbit see
05:20 - rabbit okay uh now with printing when
05:23 - you print uh a string you have to have
05:26 - it in a single code like what I did like
05:28 - this or you can have it in a double
05:30 - quote like this all right so it doesn't
05:33 - really matter as long as you have these
05:34 - two things however if you want to print
05:36 - a number that's also possible like 1 two
05:38 - three like that but now it's a type of
05:41 - an integer not a string if you were to
05:43 - make this a string it also typed out the
05:45 - same thing but it would be a different
05:47 - type if that makes sense okay now what
05:51 - if we were to type letters that weren't
05:53 - in a in a string it wouldn't be possible
05:56 - because you can't really contain letters
05:58 - as integers or any type of number that's
06:00 - why you can't print it however if we put
06:02 - that in a string I mean in a quotation
06:05 - mark then it'll work so yeah that's
06:08 - basically printing very simple very easy
06:10 - to learn and we're going to add on to
06:12 - printing later with something called
06:13 - concatenation which is basically adding
06:16 - a text with another text or a text with
06:18 - an integer or the other way around so
06:25 - yeah all right our next one is going to
06:27 - be about let's see my little chart if
06:31 - else so if else like so all
06:36 - right now most of you probably know what
06:39 - if else does but if you don't let me
06:40 - paint a picture using
06:42 - paint okay so pretend you
06:45 - have uh all right so you go on a bike
06:51 - all right this is a
06:53 - bike
06:55 - okay this is a bike and then you on your
06:58 - bike
07:00 - like
07:03 - that okay and then you're headed
07:06 - towards
07:08 - uh let's
07:11 - say let's say a bush all right so let's
07:14 - me change the color towards a
07:16 - bush and
07:20 - then okay you head it towards a bush but
07:22 - you don't know what's inside the bush
07:24 - right it could be something like spiky
07:25 - or something like dangerous so you say
07:30 - if if Bush let me just write a bush draw
07:33 - Bush okay if bush has something spiky
07:38 - inside of it like I don't know some
07:41 - spikes I don't know if there would be
07:42 - spikes but if there's a something inside
07:43 - the bsh if there's something spiky
07:44 - inside the bush then uh wait let me can
07:49 - I like crop could I select okay there's
07:53 - something inside the bush Spike inside
07:55 - the bush uh then
07:58 - go
08:00 - then go away from the bush
08:03 - so don't go so yeah don't go inside the
08:07 - bush all right so don't go inside the
08:08 - bush there's something Spike inside
08:10 - don't go inside the bush however
08:14 - if
08:15 - there's uh else this is
08:19 - uh let's see if there is something
08:22 - inside the
08:23 - bush then don't go inside else go inside
08:26 - the bush all right so inside the bush
08:31 - if there's nothing Spike inside all
08:32 - right so this is the IFL statement right
08:34 - here it's kind of complicated another
08:35 - way of representing this is if we have
08:37 - to go outside and if it's raining then
08:40 - don't go outside else go outside if it's
08:42 - not raining so yeah it's B basically
08:44 - that pretty simple okay so let's go
08:46 - ahead and write that so let's set off a
08:49 - variable first so let's pretend we have
08:52 - let's do something about money so we
08:53 - have money equals to we have five money
08:56 - right now five units of cash and we're
08:59 - going to buy something so let's say
09:01 - we're going to buy something that cost 5
09:03 - un an Apple so if we say if
09:06 - money equals to
09:09 - five then what then say
09:14 - print I bought Apple why is so big uh
09:21 - bot else
09:24 - oops else
09:27 - print to poort
09:29 - okay so that's basically how the if else
09:32 - Works money equals to five if money
09:34 - equal equals to five you say bot else it
09:36 - says too poor let's try it out it says
09:38 - bot right here let me just Del this
09:40 - really quickly all right as you can see
09:42 - it says bot and if we were to change
09:44 - money to less than like five like four
09:46 - for example it would say too poor and if
09:48 - we were to change it more than five like
09:51 - seven it would also say too poor this is
09:53 - a problem because we do have more money
09:55 - right so it doesn't really make sense in
09:56 - order to fix this we're going to say if
09:58 - money is equal or greater
10:00 - than five okay let's try it again and we
10:03 - say bot there you go it's quite simple
10:05 - if L statements like that uh so yeah
10:08 - that's basically IFL
10:10 - statements all right the next one we're
10:12 - going to be looking at is concatenation
10:14 - which is what I was talking about in the
10:16 - beginning so in order to concatenate
10:18 - something uh we have to have something
10:20 - to print first so hasht conat
10:25 - Nation all right let's say print
10:29 - uh I don't like these things where it's
10:32 - so
10:33 - huge go back up a little bit all right
10:35 - print print
10:37 - print oh my name is my name
10:42 - is name is blank and we going to say
10:47 - plus which is to concatenate uh let's
10:49 - let's make a variable called
10:51 - name name equals to
10:54 - input what is your
10:56 - name I'm pretty sure all of you know
10:58 - what input is input is basically
11:00 - allowing the user to type in something
11:02 - in order for the program to receive it
11:05 - so my name is plus
11:09 - name plus exclamation point like that
11:12 - all right let's try it out the reason I
11:13 - have a space here is because plus
11:15 - doesn't add a space so yeah what is your
11:18 - name I'm going to say
11:20 - Jimmy my name is Jimmy there you go now
11:23 - let's say if we don't have this space
11:25 - What would happen jimy oops not there
11:30 - it says my name is Jimmy like together
11:32 - doesn't have a space right in order to
11:34 - fix this if you don't want to add a
11:35 - space and you think it's annoying we're
11:36 - going to add an Anderson like that this
11:39 - will add a space for you but it could be
11:43 - annoying when you have like the ending
11:45 - with a oh wait
11:47 - what oh oh no okay got to have an
11:50 - integer so let's say I'm 14 years old I
11:55 - am I am 13 I am 13 all right that's fine
12:01 - what is your name doesn't really matter
12:02 - right
12:03 - now SN
12:07 - in
12:09 - huh well I guess ERS doesn't work with
12:12 - this type maybe I got confused but yeah
12:16 - if you have an end sense usually it
12:17 - doesn't it adds an extra space I think
12:20 - I'm just doing something wrong here but
12:23 - anyways yeah let's move on there's
12:26 - another thing called an F string which
12:27 - basically uh basically is a and which is
12:31 - oh my gosh which is uh concatenation but
12:34 - more advanced so what we want to do is
12:36 - we put F in front of our string put it
12:38 - like that then after that we put uh my
12:41 - name is like normal and instead of
12:44 - having to put like go space and plus and
12:47 - then plus again we can just put these
12:49 - little curvy brackets put a variable
12:52 - inside which is name an exclamation
12:54 - point and it automatically prints it out
12:55 - like this it's really cool what is your
12:57 - name my name is dog my name is dog there
13:00 - you go it's really easy it's called an F
13:02 - string so yeah these are the methods of
13:03 - concatenation we're going to be using in
13:05 - this project okay let's move on to the
13:08 - next one next one is going to be uh
13:11 - different types of variables this one's
13:12 - not that important to learn but it is
13:14 - quite interesting different types of
13:18 - variables like so all right so we have
13:21 - uh let's say we have a variable
13:26 - a
13:27 - a a equals to a number so we can to say
13:31 - print print type A this is so that we're
13:36 - going to show what type A is I think we
13:38 - need to yeah I'm going to I'm going to
13:40 - put all these in a I almost forgot to
13:42 - comment all these actually so we're
13:44 - going to comment them no wonder they've
13:46 - been typing so
13:48 - much like that and we're going to
13:50 - comment from the
13:53 - top there you go all right let's try it
13:57 - out class int there you go class int
14:01 - which is the type of uh type variable of
14:04 - a now if we were to change it to
14:06 - 14.1 it's going to be a float a float is
14:09 - basically an integer but with an
14:11 - additional like uh with an additional
14:15 - with a decimal even if we do 14.0 it's
14:17 - still going to be a float because we
14:19 - have a point right there so yeah now we
14:22 - do it 14.
14:25 - 0.0 it's going to be eror right yeah
14:27 - it's be error doesn't exist so let's now
14:29 - make a something that we know uh let's
14:32 - say three like that it's going to be a
14:36 - string now what if you put a number
14:38 - inside of us inside of quotation mark
14:40 - it's still going to be a string because
14:42 - it's inside of quotation mark As I told
14:43 - you earlier now what if we did 1 + one
14:47 - what would that be it would be an INT
14:49 - but if we do 1 plus one
14:51 - J now it be return to a complex so those
14:54 - are basically the four main types of uh
14:57 - variables that we know in Python and
14:59 - we're not going to be using all of them
15:00 - mostly strings integers and floats not
15:02 - really complex that much but a complex
15:04 - could be useful for example like I think
15:07 - this how it works J to one right yeah
15:10 - and then if you to plus that let's print
15:12 - a which is
15:14 - a oh a is just one plus J doesn't really
15:16 - matter unless you do this unless you do
15:20 - this right wait any objects not
15:24 - callable
15:27 - one
15:29 - uh
15:30 - okay oh I think we have to put in here
15:33 - and go one plus one times
15:37 - J like
15:40 - that okay let me just delete
15:43 - this like this and now it should work
15:46 - type okay there's so much errors going
15:48 - on here there you go now it works
15:50 - because uh we can't just print a without
15:53 - having a and we can't put multiplies I
15:56 - mean we can't put uh multiplication
15:58 - thingy inside uh our parentheses CU
16:00 - that's not how it works in Python it'll
16:02 - just come up as an error like that but
16:04 - anyways that is it for different types
16:07 - of variables let's move on to our next
16:09 - one which should be commenting
16:11 - right uh yes comments so let's move on
16:14 - to
16:15 - comments okay so in order to comment as
16:17 - you can see what I did at the beginning
16:19 - and here is I can put a hashtag in front
16:24 - of everything and make that a comment uh
16:26 - or I could put three Qui three single
16:30 - quotes like
16:31 - so and then we were to put something
16:34 - inside of it like that that would also
16:35 - be a comment there's two different types
16:37 - of commenting this way and also this way
16:40 - I can also comment all them at the same
16:42 - time
16:43 - right wait can I I'm pretty sure there's
16:45 - a command for that what do I just put a
16:50 - hashtag
16:52 - uh oh yeah like that so if I were to
16:55 - highlight something and I would just
16:56 - press play over it let mean not press
16:58 - and then tap my single quotes it would
17:01 - uh Auto automatically comment it so for
17:04 - example if I have
17:06 - print whatever this is we to press play
17:09 - it type it out but if I were to do this
17:11 - and
17:11 - press three quotation single quotes like
17:14 - that it wouldn't do anything anymore
17:16 - because it's commented the best use for
17:18 - these triple single quotes is if it has
17:21 - like two lines like this or more than
17:25 - one line however if it's one line just
17:26 - go to the front and press hashtag it's a
17:28 - lotas easier as you can see does same
17:30 - thing so yeah that's basically
17:31 - commenting quite
17:33 - easy all right let's move on to our
17:35 - second to last one which is math uh
17:37 - we're going to be using a lot of math in
17:39 - our uh in our what do you call python
17:42 - bot because we have to calculate the
17:44 - pixels and where a mouse should press so
17:46 - this is kind of important but uh we're
17:48 - not going to be doing much a lot of
17:50 - difficult complex math it's just more
17:52 - like addition subtraction but just in uh
17:55 - more more layers than usually than usual
17:58 - so yeah let's try it out so let's say we
18:00 - have a is our first variable which say
18:03 - 10 then we have B which is let's say
18:07 - three we say print a minus
18:11 - B it print out seven which is what 10 -
18:15 - 3 is all right now let's do a plus
18:19 - b it's going to be 13 a * B is going to
18:24 - be 30 like so and then a divided by B
18:29 - where's divide divide is
18:33 - slash it's going to be 3.32 33 and they
18:36 - run it up to five all right now we going
18:38 - to do three a parentheses sign I mean
18:42 - not parentheses uh this is called a mod
18:45 - so a mod b it's going to go to one uh
18:49 - which is basically finding the remainder
18:51 - so for example mod can be really useful
18:53 - when we're trying to find if it's an
18:55 - even or odd number so for example uh if
18:57 - I have a a right so if say a mod
19:00 - 2 uh it's going to be zero like so but
19:04 - if an a is an odd number it's going to
19:05 - be equal to one or something else so for
19:08 - example
19:09 - 13 oh wait it's always going to be equal
19:11 - to one sorry all right so this checks if
19:13 - it's an even or odd number so for
19:15 - example in like uh situations where you
19:17 - have to code a game to check if they
19:19 - like are stepping on even or odd Square
19:22 - then you would use this right here a mod
19:24 - all right let's move on to the next one
19:25 - which is uh which is is what do you call
19:28 - it exponents yeah so you could usually
19:31 - people think it's like this with a
19:33 - little carrot which is how we do it in a
19:34 - lot of
19:36 - calculators and it doesn't really work
19:39 - if it's a carrot it actually subtracts
19:42 - that's kind of cool actually I didn't
19:43 - know
19:44 - that oh wait it add wait I'm confused I
19:48 - don't know what it what do a car to I I
19:50 - didn't even know that was a thing that
19:51 - was come a to
19:53 - five oh it
19:55 - adds oh it does add okay so a carrot
19:59 - adds for some reason but that's not why
20:01 - I'm going to that's that's not what I'm
20:02 - going to show you I'm going to show you
20:03 - how to do an exponent which is just
20:05 - multiply which is the Star Sign I didn't
20:08 - even show multiply yet multiply like
20:10 - that and then we do another one this is
20:13 - now going to make it into an exponent so
20:16 - it should be 100 like so so that's
20:18 - basically the simple math exponents uh
20:21 - modding addition subtraction Division
20:23 - and multiplication which is what we're
20:25 - going to be using okay let's comment
20:27 - that with
20:29 - trick code single Cote single code like
20:31 - so make sure it's three or else it will
20:33 - come an error okay once that done that
20:36 - we're going to move on to our last topic
20:37 - for today which is arrays arays is like
20:41 - uh pretend let me pull up my good old
20:43 - paint again not that
20:45 - paint paint okay so pretend you have a
20:51 - box okay this is your box inside your
20:56 - box you have like a maybe like computer
20:59 - I don't know why you put computers at a
21:00 - box but you do so that's that's like
21:03 - more like a phone but that's a computer
21:05 - uh you have a soccer
21:08 - ball okay yeah it's a horrible looking
21:11 - one but it's fine okay uh and then you
21:14 - have your dog all right you have your
21:18 - dog okay I don't know what dog that is
21:21 - but it's a dog okay I'm more like a
21:23 - squirrel um okay now that's basically it
21:27 - this box right here
21:30 - is called an array and the things inside
21:33 - your
21:35 - box are what's inside of the array so
21:38 - they're like the
21:39 - little uh objects they're the objects
21:42 - yeah so let's go ahead and create an
21:44 - array #
21:45 - array okay so let's make an array let's
21:48 - say box equals 2 uh these brackets right
21:51 - here this is how you start an array and
21:53 - if you were to print the type of box
21:55 - print
21:56 - type box box like so it would come as a
22:01 - list which is basically an array so it's
22:03 - the same thing uh all right so let's
22:08 - enter some inputs into it so we can have
22:10 - a dog our
22:15 - computer and we also have
22:18 - a what is it a soccer ball so a
22:22 - soccer like that okay now if we're to
22:26 - print out our box what would it look
22:28 - like it would just print out this thing
22:31 - right here which is the
22:33 - array and now we're going to be uh
22:37 - pulling out some things from the array
22:38 - individually so pretend we only want a
22:40 - dog we could pull a box zero and array
22:44 - always starts from zero so this should
22:45 - be number zero one and two we do Bo
22:49 - parentheses zero is going to bring out
22:50 - the dog and as you expect one would be
22:53 - the computer and then last but not least
22:55 - two would be the ball soccer ball all
22:57 - all right there you go pretty simple
22:59 - stuff and you can also add integers as
23:01 - well as strings into the same array so
23:03 - it pretend have one right here so I pull
23:05 - out number three is going just press one
23:07 - like
23:08 - so an array can even contain an array
23:11 - which can contain an array in itself and
23:13 - keeps going further and this makes it
23:15 - really complicated but you could do that
23:17 - if you wanted to uh I'm just not
23:19 - recommending it because it might get too
23:21 - complicated or overload your PC but yeah
23:23 - that's basically what an array does you
23:25 - can add and remove stuff into an array
23:27 - as well so I can go ahead and do that uh
23:31 - box. aend right box. aend let's say SDF
23:37 - whatever all right and now after that
23:40 - wait I got to not print it right box out
23:42 - a pen I'm going to say print
23:45 - box uh so we have 0 1 two 3 4 print box
23:49 - five which should be this
23:52 - thing box 5 0 one two three oh four four
23:59 - like so and prints that out now if we
24:01 - were to say box.
24:03 - remove let me just delete this all right
24:06 - box. remove
24:09 - oops uh oh box.
24:13 - remove move
24:17 - dog remove dog like so and we're going
24:21 - to print box zero it's not going to be
24:23 - dog anymore it's going to be computer
24:24 - because it's just going to kick dog out
24:25 - then move computer over like so there
24:28 - you go so yeah that's basically it for
24:30 - what we're going to be doing today this
24:31 - is the oops this is what we're going
24:35 - this is
24:36 - what we did today arrays comments
24:39 - different types of variables if else
24:42 - print and conation so yeah that's
24:44 - basically it uh I hope you enjoyed this
24:46 - video that's Basics we haven't started
24:48 - anything yet but we have to know this in
24:49 - order to build our bot yeah anyway see
24:52 - you in the next episode bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody my name is Jimmy and today I will be showing you how you can make your own python bot that will automate your games for you so for example this aim trainer right here if I were to play it by myself as you can see I have horrible aim I cannot even press it and uh in order to fix this I decided to make my own python bot that can easily do like this which is to track all the dots for you and even if I'm pretending to be the body self or blame anyway is this you can automate your games using this python bot which would track objects and click it for example like uh like Resort like not Resort games like mobile games those on where you have to press people in order to collect money or something uh it you can use it for a variety of things and today's is going to be episode one which is where I'm going to lay out the basics and teach you some of like um how to install stuff and the basics of python basically if you don't want to if you already know how to do these things you don't have to to do it for example in this video I'm going to be uh talking about printing IFL statements concatenation commenting different types of variables and math and python as well as arrays so if you don't if you already know all these things then you can go ahead and skip to the next episode where I might be making I might be starting to make a bot or I might still be laying out some Basics but anyways let's get started first things first let's go ahead and install Visual Studio codes which is where we're going to be uh which is what we're going to be using to code it's a python editor which means me that it edit python so let's go ahead search that Visual Studio code like that go to download right here and then download for Windows uh I'm not using a Mac or Linux so I don't know if it will work the same way as Windows but anyways just press this big blue button okay and now once you press in here it's going to ask you to set up press save all right now just open it up uh I accept next just press next next wait okay next and then in here yeah just press next all right neck and install like that and that's it wait for it to install and then we're done all right after it's done installing we just press finish and it opens up okay once we've got to this welcome menu right here we're going to go to our extensions and we're going to search for pyth well I I already searched it up beforehand but if you didn't search python press enter Then you see the first thing comes up this one press install I already have it installed so mine comes up uninstall and after you're done installing python you want to go to here and search python indent like so is this guy press on it and press install this will basically make it a lot easier for you to type python as you can see it just automatically indents it for you which is a lot easier than having to tab press tab so yeah let's go back to our Explorer all right okay now let's go create go ahead and create a file control n okay let's close these two up I'm going to save this into a folder which I'll know how to do coding Python and let's just make our uh python robot python bot all right and I'll save this as uh part one. py make sure it's py or else it won't work okay now we can use control+ to zoom in it's bit too much all right there all right once we zoomed in we're going to now start our coding so first things first what we want to do let me close this up is printing so printing is quite simple actually all we got to do is print hello world this is the probably the easiest command in all of programming in order to run this we press control B no that's that's for Sublime Text we press over here uh and oh I think we got to go go here first first then choose where is it editor no wait do we select python yeah just python PR oh python not installed what I already inst python all right it looks like I haven't installed python on this computer which is kind of weird oh maybe it's because I factory res my computer like a few weeks ago that's why I don't have python but anyways okay I'll download python while we're waiting all right now python is installed uh so yeah let's go ahead and try it again uhoh that one there you go I press play as you can see it now works hello world all right that's our basic print command I'm going to actually make a little heading going be print print okay uh and in printing we we can do a lot of stuff with it we can do a lot of things with it Bas actually so let's take for example print a variable so we're going to set uh x equals to in strings rabbit like that we can say print X and it will say rabbit see rabbit okay uh now with printing when you print uh a string you have to have it in a single code like what I did like this or you can have it in a double quote like this all right so it doesn't really matter as long as you have these two things however if you want to print a number that's also possible like 1 two three like that but now it's a type of an integer not a string if you were to make this a string it also typed out the same thing but it would be a different type if that makes sense okay now what if we were to type letters that weren't in a in a string it wouldn't be possible because you can't really contain letters as integers or any type of number that's why you can't print it however if we put that in a string I mean in a quotation mark then it'll work so yeah that's basically printing very simple very easy to learn and we're going to add on to printing later with something called concatenation which is basically adding a text with another text or a text with an integer or the other way around so yeah all right our next one is going to be about let's see my little chart if else so if else like so all right now most of you probably know what if else does but if you don't let me paint a picture using paint okay so pretend you have uh all right so you go on a bike all right this is a bike okay this is a bike and then you on your bike like that okay and then you're headed towards uh let's say let's say a bush all right so let's me change the color towards a bush and then okay you head it towards a bush but you don't know what's inside the bush right it could be something like spiky or something like dangerous so you say if if Bush let me just write a bush draw Bush okay if bush has something spiky inside of it like I don't know some spikes I don't know if there would be spikes but if there's a something inside the bsh if there's something spiky inside the bush then uh wait let me can I like crop could I select okay there's something inside the bush Spike inside the bush uh then go then go away from the bush so don't go so yeah don't go inside the bush all right so don't go inside the bush there's something Spike inside don't go inside the bush however if there's uh else this is uh let's see if there is something inside the bush then don't go inside else go inside the bush all right so inside the bush if there's nothing Spike inside all right so this is the IFL statement right here it's kind of complicated another way of representing this is if we have to go outside and if it's raining then don't go outside else go outside if it's not raining so yeah it's B basically that pretty simple okay so let's go ahead and write that so let's set off a variable first so let's pretend we have let's do something about money so we have money equals to we have five money right now five units of cash and we're going to buy something so let's say we're going to buy something that cost 5 un an Apple so if we say if money equals to five then what then say print I bought Apple why is so big uh bot else oops else print to poort okay so that's basically how the if else Works money equals to five if money equal equals to five you say bot else it says too poor let's try it out it says bot right here let me just Del this really quickly all right as you can see it says bot and if we were to change money to less than like five like four for example it would say too poor and if we were to change it more than five like seven it would also say too poor this is a problem because we do have more money right so it doesn't really make sense in order to fix this we're going to say if money is equal or greater than five okay let's try it again and we say bot there you go it's quite simple if L statements like that uh so yeah that's basically IFL statements all right the next one we're going to be looking at is concatenation which is what I was talking about in the beginning so in order to concatenate something uh we have to have something to print first so hasht conat Nation all right let's say print uh I don't like these things where it's so huge go back up a little bit all right print print print oh my name is my name is name is blank and we going to say plus which is to concatenate uh let's let's make a variable called name name equals to input what is your name I'm pretty sure all of you know what input is input is basically allowing the user to type in something in order for the program to receive it so my name is plus name plus exclamation point like that all right let's try it out the reason I have a space here is because plus doesn't add a space so yeah what is your name I'm going to say Jimmy my name is Jimmy there you go now let's say if we don't have this space What would happen jimy oops not there it says my name is Jimmy like together doesn't have a space right in order to fix this if you don't want to add a space and you think it's annoying we're going to add an Anderson like that this will add a space for you but it could be annoying when you have like the ending with a oh wait what oh oh no okay got to have an integer so let's say I'm 14 years old I am I am 13 I am 13 all right that's fine what is your name doesn't really matter right now SN in huh well I guess ERS doesn't work with this type maybe I got confused but yeah if you have an end sense usually it doesn't it adds an extra space I think I'm just doing something wrong here but anyways yeah let's move on there's another thing called an F string which basically uh basically is a and which is oh my gosh which is uh concatenation but more advanced so what we want to do is we put F in front of our string put it like that then after that we put uh my name is like normal and instead of having to put like go space and plus and then plus again we can just put these little curvy brackets put a variable inside which is name an exclamation point and it automatically prints it out like this it's really cool what is your name my name is dog my name is dog there you go it's really easy it's called an F string so yeah these are the methods of concatenation we're going to be using in this project okay let's move on to the next one next one is going to be uh different types of variables this one's not that important to learn but it is quite interesting different types of variables like so all right so we have uh let's say we have a variable a a a equals to a number so we can to say print print type A this is so that we're going to show what type A is I think we need to yeah I'm going to I'm going to put all these in a I almost forgot to comment all these actually so we're going to comment them no wonder they've been typing so much like that and we're going to comment from the top there you go all right let's try it out class int there you go class int which is the type of uh type variable of a now if we were to change it to 14.1 it's going to be a float a float is basically an integer but with an additional like uh with an additional with a decimal even if we do 14.0 it's still going to be a float because we have a point right there so yeah now we do it 14. 0.0 it's going to be eror right yeah it's be error doesn't exist so let's now make a something that we know uh let's say three like that it's going to be a string now what if you put a number inside of us inside of quotation mark it's still going to be a string because it's inside of quotation mark As I told you earlier now what if we did 1 + one what would that be it would be an INT but if we do 1 plus one J now it be return to a complex so those are basically the four main types of uh variables that we know in Python and we're not going to be using all of them mostly strings integers and floats not really complex that much but a complex could be useful for example like I think this how it works J to one right yeah and then if you to plus that let's print a which is a oh a is just one plus J doesn't really matter unless you do this unless you do this right wait any objects not callable one uh okay oh I think we have to put in here and go one plus one times J like that okay let me just delete this like this and now it should work type okay there's so much errors going on here there you go now it works because uh we can't just print a without having a and we can't put multiplies I mean we can't put uh multiplication thingy inside uh our parentheses CU that's not how it works in Python it'll just come up as an error like that but anyways that is it for different types of variables let's move on to our next one which should be commenting right uh yes comments so let's move on to comments okay so in order to comment as you can see what I did at the beginning and here is I can put a hashtag in front of everything and make that a comment uh or I could put three Qui three single quotes like so and then we were to put something inside of it like that that would also be a comment there's two different types of commenting this way and also this way I can also comment all them at the same time right wait can I I'm pretty sure there's a command for that what do I just put a hashtag uh oh yeah like that so if I were to highlight something and I would just press play over it let mean not press and then tap my single quotes it would uh Auto automatically comment it so for example if I have print whatever this is we to press play it type it out but if I were to do this and press three quotation single quotes like that it wouldn't do anything anymore because it's commented the best use for these triple single quotes is if it has like two lines like this or more than one line however if it's one line just go to the front and press hashtag it's a lotas easier as you can see does same thing so yeah that's basically commenting quite easy all right let's move on to our second to last one which is math uh we're going to be using a lot of math in our uh in our what do you call python bot because we have to calculate the pixels and where a mouse should press so this is kind of important but uh we're not going to be doing much a lot of difficult complex math it's just more like addition subtraction but just in uh more more layers than usually than usual so yeah let's try it out so let's say we have a is our first variable which say 10 then we have B which is let's say three we say print a minus B it print out seven which is what 10 3 is all right now let's do a plus b it's going to be 13 a * B is going to be 30 like so and then a divided by B where's divide divide is slash it's going to be 3.32 33 and they run it up to five all right now we going to do three a parentheses sign I mean not parentheses uh this is called a mod so a mod b it's going to go to one uh which is basically finding the remainder so for example mod can be really useful when we're trying to find if it's an even or odd number so for example uh if I have a a right so if say a mod 2 uh it's going to be zero like so but if an a is an odd number it's going to be equal to one or something else so for example 13 oh wait it's always going to be equal to one sorry all right so this checks if it's an even or odd number so for example in like uh situations where you have to code a game to check if they like are stepping on even or odd Square then you would use this right here a mod all right let's move on to the next one which is uh which is is what do you call it exponents yeah so you could usually people think it's like this with a little carrot which is how we do it in a lot of calculators and it doesn't really work if it's a carrot it actually subtracts that's kind of cool actually I didn't know that oh wait it add wait I'm confused I don't know what it what do a car to I I didn't even know that was a thing that was come a to five oh it adds oh it does add okay so a carrot adds for some reason but that's not why I'm going to that's that's not what I'm going to show you I'm going to show you how to do an exponent which is just multiply which is the Star Sign I didn't even show multiply yet multiply like that and then we do another one this is now going to make it into an exponent so it should be 100 like so so that's basically the simple math exponents uh modding addition subtraction Division and multiplication which is what we're going to be using okay let's comment that with trick code single Cote single code like so make sure it's three or else it will come an error okay once that done that we're going to move on to our last topic for today which is arrays arays is like uh pretend let me pull up my good old paint again not that paint paint okay so pretend you have a box okay this is your box inside your box you have like a maybe like computer I don't know why you put computers at a box but you do so that's that's like more like a phone but that's a computer uh you have a soccer ball okay yeah it's a horrible looking one but it's fine okay uh and then you have your dog all right you have your dog okay I don't know what dog that is but it's a dog okay I'm more like a squirrel um okay now that's basically it this box right here is called an array and the things inside your box are what's inside of the array so they're like the little uh objects they're the objects yeah so let's go ahead and create an array # array okay so let's make an array let's say box equals 2 uh these brackets right here this is how you start an array and if you were to print the type of box print type box box like so it would come as a list which is basically an array so it's the same thing uh all right so let's enter some inputs into it so we can have a dog our computer and we also have a what is it a soccer ball so a soccer like that okay now if we're to print out our box what would it look like it would just print out this thing right here which is the array and now we're going to be uh pulling out some things from the array individually so pretend we only want a dog we could pull a box zero and array always starts from zero so this should be number zero one and two we do Bo parentheses zero is going to bring out the dog and as you expect one would be the computer and then last but not least two would be the ball soccer ball all all right there you go pretty simple stuff and you can also add integers as well as strings into the same array so it pretend have one right here so I pull out number three is going just press one like so an array can even contain an array which can contain an array in itself and keeps going further and this makes it really complicated but you could do that if you wanted to uh I'm just not recommending it because it might get too complicated or overload your PC but yeah that's basically what an array does you can add and remove stuff into an array as well so I can go ahead and do that uh box. aend right box. aend let's say SDF whatever all right and now after that wait I got to not print it right box out a pen I'm going to say print box uh so we have 0 1 two 3 4 print box five which should be this thing box 5 0 one two three oh four four like so and prints that out now if we were to say box. remove let me just delete this all right box. remove oops uh oh box. remove move dog remove dog like so and we're going to print box zero it's not going to be dog anymore it's going to be computer because it's just going to kick dog out then move computer over like so there you go so yeah that's basically it for what we're going to be doing today this is the oops this is what we're going this is what we did today arrays comments different types of variables if else print and conation so yeah that's basically it uh I hope you enjoyed this video that's Basics we haven't started anything yet but we have to know this in order to build our bot yeah anyway see you in the next episode bye
