00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to another
00:01 - video today i will be giving you a brief
00:04 - overview on
00:05 - uh seabourn pandas and matplotlib
00:09 - basically today we're going to be
00:10 - looking at patterns inside of the
00:12 - pokemon dataset
00:14 - which we found earlier in the uh
00:17 - other stream or video and we're going to
00:20 - be using this link for our information
00:22 - of pokemon i will leave it in the
00:24 - description basically it's just
00:27 - uh a page full of data's about pokemon
00:31 - there is the name the type 1 type 2 the
00:34 - hp
00:34 - the attack defense the special attack
00:36 - and the special defense
00:38 - at first i thought this was speed attack
00:40 - and speed defense
00:41 - but i was wrong it's actually special
00:43 - attack and special defense
00:44 - um there's the speed generation and
00:46 - legendary so we're gonna be using this
00:48 - data set
00:49 - uh for today's video um and today video
00:52 - we're just going to be looking at
00:54 - patterns inside of
00:56 - the pokemon data set using graphs so
00:58 - we're going to be trying to find like
01:00 - uh unique patterns that happen inside of
01:03 - this graph
01:04 - so let's begin first we got to import
01:06 - our libraries that we need which is
01:08 - pandas
01:09 - matplotlib.piplot and seaborn if you
01:12 - don't have these
01:13 - pip install yet then you should uh but
01:16 - with colab you don't need to you can
01:17 - just pip installed here
01:19 - by using this command exclamation point
01:23 - pip install and whatever you want after
01:26 - that
01:26 - uh like seaborn like so uh you can also
01:30 - do this with matplotlib
01:31 - and pandas but i would recommend you to
01:34 - go into your command prompt or cmd
01:37 - uh let me show you how so go into here
01:39 - type in cmd
01:41 - open it up and then type in a
01:44 - pip no exclamation point this time
01:47 - install
01:48 - matplotlib or
01:52 - pip install seaborn and
01:56 - uh last but not least pandas like this
01:59 - um
01:59 - and this will basically make sure that
02:01 - inside of your
02:02 - computer or python libraries there is
02:05 - going to be
02:06 - these libraries installed too i would
02:08 - recommend you to do that but you don't
02:10 - have to
02:11 - you can just install it from collab so
02:13 - once we
02:14 - have pip installed we want to import
02:16 - them and we're going to import pandas as
02:18 - pd
02:18 - um this is to use uh to shorten the
02:21 - names instead of having to type out
02:23 - pandas dot uh something or matplotlib
02:26 - dot pi plot dot
02:28 - seaborn dot we just need to type out
02:30 - pd.plt dot and sns dot
02:32 - uh which is really short and simple to
02:34 - use after that we need matplotlib
02:37 - inline uh this is so that we can display
02:39 - our graph instead of
02:41 - like having nothing if you don't have
02:42 - this then you won't be able to see the
02:44 - graphs
02:45 - so you must have this code now let's
02:47 - move on to the next one
02:49 - this will basically grab the pokemon
02:51 - data set we need
02:52 - so you might have already saw the link
02:55 - this is what it looks like
02:56 - uh it just has a bunch of pokemons uh
02:59 - type one type two
03:00 - the name and etc and we're gonna be
03:03 - grabbing this information
03:05 - and then we're gonna put it inside pokey
03:07 - data so
03:08 - uh this one basically grabs it and then
03:11 - it stores it inside a path
03:13 - so this is the path of a github content
03:15 - pokemon underscore dataset.csv
03:18 - uh use this one to get the path and then
03:20 - after that pokeydata equals to pd which
03:22 - is pandas.read.csv
03:25 - this will read the csv file um at the
03:28 - path
03:28 - and it will have index column goes to
03:30 - zero this will basically store
03:33 - our whole entire data set or this whole
03:35 - page right here
03:36 - into this variable or this pandas panda
03:39 - data frame
03:40 - pokey data and then now we have a data
03:42 - set of our own called pokedata
03:45 - let's run this oh shoot i forgot to run
03:47 - this one i keep on forgetting to import
03:49 - stuff once i get explaining i just
03:51 - lose track um but let's wait for it to
03:54 - connect to our google drive first
03:56 - and then it's it's going to come with an
03:58 - error for sure um
04:00 - but we just got to run this one and this
04:02 - one and this one
04:03 - so let's import our libraries okay
04:06 - and then after that we will grab the
04:08 - information
04:11 - and it will come up like a bunch of
04:13 - stuff here
04:14 - but don't worry this is correct it's not
04:16 - an error or anything
04:17 - 100 um so this is just make sure that
04:20 - stored in
04:21 - and then after that in here we'll just
04:24 - store
04:25 - the information into pokedata perfect
04:28 - now we have all our information inside
04:30 - of pokedata
04:31 - uh now this works as uh any data set
04:34 - would
04:34 - you can do uh like this one print out
04:37 - the type one
04:38 - it will only print out the column type
04:40 - one so we can see here
04:42 - it has 800 rows
04:46 - of type 1 and i'm not sure how much
04:49 - columns it has but we can also check
04:51 - by using this command pokeydata.com but
04:54 - we're not there yet
04:55 - first i want to do something actually
04:58 - let me show you something
04:59 - uh let's type in pokedata
05:03 - pokedata it would be good if we have
05:05 - this copied
05:06 - pokedata dot um
05:10 - not dot head which will print out the
05:12 - first five
05:13 - uh rows and all the columns
05:16 - like so and now here is what it looks
05:19 - like into a data frame
05:20 - uh there's the name type one type 2
05:23 - everything that that page has
05:25 - uh and there is these which are the
05:28 - integers it's the hp the attack the
05:31 - defense the special attack the special
05:33 - defense
05:34 - and the speed um i will combine all of
05:36 - these into
05:37 - one column which i will call total uh in
05:39 - total
05:40 - it's just going to be the overall stats
05:42 - of the pokemon
05:43 - uh so in here we're going to make that
05:46 - happen
05:47 - so we're going to have pokedata brackets
05:50 - inside we will name our new column uh i
05:53 - named it total
05:54 - because it's uh what i want to name it
05:57 - you can name it anything like
05:58 - overall or uh that uh stats or
06:01 - anything um and this will equal to
06:04 - pokedata hp
06:06 - uh hp plus pokedata attack this one
06:10 - defense s special attack or speed first
06:14 - special attack special defense and then
06:16 - finally special
06:18 - oh i have two special attacks i'm so
06:19 - sorry i have two special attacks i'm
06:21 - supposed to have special defense
06:23 - oh how could i let this go okay so once
06:26 - we have that all added up we want to do
06:29 - is we want to run it
06:30 - so shift enter to run um and once you
06:33 - did that
06:34 - let's look at the columns so
06:37 - pokedata.com will just print out all the
06:39 - column names
06:40 - so we have name type 1 type 2 hp attack
06:44 - defense special attack
06:45 - special defense the speed the generation
06:48 - and legendary
06:49 - finally we have the new column which we
06:52 - just made
06:53 - called total if we were to run dot head
06:55 - again then we would have
06:56 - an extra uh an extra column here which
07:00 - is total
07:01 - okay let's move on um now we can just uh
07:05 - oh i have another head here it's okay i
07:07 - don't need that so
07:08 - now we can just move on to our graphs or
07:11 - our plots
07:12 - we're going to be starting off with the
07:13 - count plot um so let's run it
07:16 - this count plot will be about the type
07:19 - one
07:19 - so it will just list out how much type
07:22 - ones there are
07:22 - the x-axis is the type one as you can
07:25 - see
07:26 - and the y-axis is account account is
07:28 - basically
07:29 - how much pokemons are there or the
07:31 - number of it so
07:33 - there's uh above 100 pokemons with water
07:36 - type
07:36 - around 125 pokemons with water type
07:40 - and then we can see like uh 70 pokemons
07:43 - with grass types
07:44 - s um on and on uh also we can see
07:48 - that the least one is the flying type
07:50 - which is
07:51 - um around two pokemons with flying type
07:54 - as type one
07:55 - because this is because uh well all
07:58 - pokemons
07:59 - well not all pokemons but most of the
08:01 - pokemons can fly
08:02 - they have the ability to fly but it's
08:04 - not like their main
08:06 - uh ability like charizard like he can
08:08 - fly or
08:09 - it can fly um but they're the main
08:12 - type is fire and like uh articuno
08:16 - it's a legendary bird i'm pretty sure
08:19 - it's ice um
08:20 - it can fly but it's iced so type one is
08:23 - ice
08:24 - uh and zapdos uh moltres
08:28 - ho o and so on and so on they all can
08:30 - fly but it's not like their main type
08:32 - and also all the bug pokemons like um
08:36 - like i forget their name um no
08:40 - metapod no metapod can't fly what's the
08:42 - evolution of metapod
08:43 - uh b b drop b drill b drill okay
08:48 - be drill right if it's not then i'm
08:50 - gonna look like really dumb okay it's
08:52 - beedrill okay
08:53 - like virgil can fly but it's like a bug
08:55 - type so
08:56 - it's not really like the main type but
08:59 - since all pokemons can fly
09:01 - or not all but most of them can fly type
09:03 - 2 will probably be flying
09:05 - um i made a prediction that it would be
09:07 - flying because
09:08 - it's you know all pokemons can fly but
09:10 - it's not like their main ability
09:12 - so they probably put it in type two
09:14 - let's see
09:15 - so this one i changed it uh instead of
09:18 - having type one as the x-axis
09:19 - i made type two as the x-axis and you
09:22 - can see that
09:23 - flying just out outweighs every single
09:26 - uh type since uh you know not much
09:29 - not as much pokemons have uh these types
09:32 - as their type two
09:33 - most of them have it as their type one
09:34 - but you can see flying has
09:36 - like like most of the count because
09:40 - uh you know as i said earlier and he
09:42 - said this probably a hundred times but
09:44 - most pokemons can fly so they put their
09:47 - type two as flying
09:48 - however it's not like their main special
09:50 - ability so they don't put it as type one
09:53 - unless some special cases then maybe
09:55 - they put it as type one
09:56 - because we can see here that some
09:57 - pokemons do have flying as their type
09:59 - one
10:00 - okay let's move on to the box plot the
10:02 - box plot looks somewhat like
10:04 - this now i will explain to you in detail
10:07 - what this is
10:08 - it might look very confusing at first
10:09 - but trust me it's not
10:11 - so uh this colorful blocks no
10:14 - blocks box in the middle is the average
10:17 - or the regression of the entire
10:19 - uh of the range so this is the
10:23 - average um you can see all of this is
10:25 - the average and then the actual range
10:27 - itself
10:27 - is these two lines over here these two
10:30 - lines
10:31 - um so the hp i'm gonna compare between
10:34 - the hp
10:34 - the attack the defense and the speed so
10:37 - uh
10:37 - on the left side is just how much it is
10:40 - uh
10:41 - so in here the hp you can see that it's
10:43 - around the range
10:44 - or the average is around 125 to zero
10:48 - and then inside of that it has the
10:50 - regression which is around 50 to 75
10:53 - so this is worth like the average hp is
10:55 - and that goes for the attack defense and
10:57 - speed
10:58 - however we can see these little diamond
11:00 - shapes these are called the outliners
11:02 - uh the outliners are like those um
11:06 - those people like maybe in your school
11:08 - or something that
11:09 - is like very good at something or very
11:11 - bad at something
11:12 - so these are the outliners either
11:15 - they're very good or
11:16 - too good in that category or too bad so
11:19 - we can see
11:20 - as a good example in hp here uh there is
11:23 - a bunch of outliners
11:24 - that is like exceeding the normal hp
11:26 - limit but you can see that there is one
11:29 - that has zero hp or one hp i'm not sure
11:32 - what this one is but
11:33 - you can see it's an outliner it has no
11:35 - hp at all but these ones have
11:37 - like a bunch of hp um and we can see
11:40 - that these two are very outstanding hp
11:43 - i'll give you a guess on which uh which
11:46 - pokemons are these
11:53 - uh your time is up but for me i since i
11:57 - play a lot of pokemon go i know that
11:58 - these
11:59 - two are probably chansey and blissy
12:01 - since they are very
12:03 - uh tank uh they tank a lot of hits
12:06 - like from the best attacker in pokemon
12:08 - go which is alkazam
12:09 - using sidestrike they can withstand a
12:11 - lot of hits too
12:12 - i watch a youtube video on it it's
12:14 - pretty cool it can like
12:16 - it it almost outweighs the gym time uh
12:18 - so whenever you battle a gym i'm gonna
12:20 - go off track a little but whenever you
12:22 - battle a gym you have a limited amount
12:23 - of time to beat it
12:24 - if you don't then you just get sent out
12:26 - and then you have to retry again
12:28 - but chansey can take a lot of hits and
12:30 - it takes like
12:31 - around half the time to kill chancy or
12:34 - to like knock it out
12:35 - and if there was like not chancy sorry
12:37 - blissey um and if pretend there was like
12:40 - three chant
12:41 - blisseys inside of the of the gym
12:44 - then you wouldn't have enough time to uh
12:47 - defeat the gym
12:48 - unless you defeat one of them and then
12:49 - get their hp low enough
12:51 - so you can defeat them quicker um the
12:53 - next round but yeah
12:54 - anyways i'm going off track chansey and
12:56 - blissey are very good at tanking
12:58 - uh and they are very high hp too
13:02 - and then yeah this is the box plot it
13:04 - helps us find the outliners
13:06 - and the medium or the regression line in
13:08 - the middle
13:09 - so yeah that's the box plot now let's
13:11 - look at the scatter plot the scatter
13:12 - plot is a bunch of dots
13:14 - and it kind of looked complicated but
13:16 - i'll explain to you
13:17 - very simply and i am using the x
13:20 - axis as defense and the y axis as attack
13:23 - so we can see if it correlates with each
13:25 - other or not so we can see here that
13:27 - it is not as like great uh so we can see
13:32 - that
13:32 - the more attack the less defense usually
13:36 - okay
13:36 - like over here the more attack you have
13:38 - the less defense you will have
13:40 - unless it's like a very good pokemon
13:42 - like this one it has pretty good defense
13:44 - and
13:45 - really good attack but most of it is
13:47 - around over here which is like
13:49 - okay defense okay attack but it's not
13:51 - like if you have
13:52 - more more defense then you have more
13:55 - attack it's kind of the opposite
13:56 - if you have more attack then you have
13:58 - less defense if you have more defense
14:00 - then you have less attack but like as
14:02 - you can see these are outliners which
14:03 - like
14:04 - they don't go under the same rules as
14:06 - other people
14:07 - and this is probably not chancy though
14:09 - not chancey or blissey since
14:11 - they do no damage at all even though
14:13 - they're really good at tanking they do
14:14 - like
14:16 - five attack damage they're really really
14:18 - weak for attacking
14:19 - but um yeah anyways they uh
14:23 - these are some outliners that don't
14:24 - follow the rules but most of the pokemon
14:26 - follow the rules and go like
14:28 - if you have a lot of attack then you
14:29 - have less defense you have a lot of
14:31 - defense then you don't have that much
14:32 - attack
14:33 - so this is a way to find out some
14:35 - patterns let's move on to lm plot lm
14:38 - plot
14:38 - uh i will show you right now it looks
14:41 - somewhat
14:42 - complicated as i said earlier but it's
14:44 - very simple
14:45 - so we can see there's a bunch of lines
14:47 - in the middle uh let me explain the
14:49 - lines first the lines are
14:50 - the average of uh the types so here we
14:53 - can see the types
14:55 - and uh this is because we put in the
14:58 - command hue
14:59 - equals to type one hue basically lets us
15:02 - um see in more detail of the graph if we
15:06 - don't have the command hue
15:08 - then this is what would look like it'll
15:09 - be all blue um
15:11 - it'll probably look a little bit more
15:12 - simple but it's not that
15:14 - detailed uh and we won't know what which
15:17 - dot is what type
15:18 - and each dot is a pokemon by the way so
15:21 - now if we do this
15:22 - we can see the type of the pokemon
15:26 - it might take a little while but here it
15:27 - comes so we can see each type so like
15:29 - this one we know it's like a water type
15:32 - um and like the blue one is probably
15:34 - like a
15:35 - rock or a ghost type uh but yeah we can
15:38 - see more detail
15:39 - of the graph and we can also see that
15:43 - let me show you these two up here um you
15:46 - probably know which one it is since it's
15:47 - like
15:48 - 250 hp and 255 hp
15:51 - and i'll give you a hint they're both uh
15:53 - where is it
15:54 - they're both is chanting normal type i
15:58 - think chansey is normal type right
16:00 - uh chansey type
16:03 - type probably normal type yeah so it's
16:06 - normal type so
16:07 - we can see here that since it's normal
16:08 - type uh and
16:10 - there's a lot of hp it's probably chancy
16:12 - and blissy since we already looked at
16:14 - that
16:14 - um but yeah so we can see the types of
16:17 - each pokemon
16:18 - and we can see like the average of each
16:20 - type through the lines
16:23 - and looks like most of them are around
16:24 - here around 50 hp
16:27 - to 150 hp from uh 200
16:30 - total to 500 total somewhere so yeah
16:33 - this
16:34 - is uh the average line of pokemons but
16:36 - as i said earlier there is
16:38 - some outliners that don't follow the
16:39 - rules and they just do
16:41 - like uh amazing at something or really
16:44 - bad at something
16:45 - okay let's move on to the pair plot the
16:47 - pair plot looks somewhat like this
16:50 - sorry if there's a big sound in the
16:52 - background but anyways the pair plot
16:54 - looks uh it's kind of slow because it's
16:58 - a
16:58 - it's a big plot um but it has scatter
17:01 - plots on the side and through the middle
17:03 - it's a histogram
17:06 - okay one second um because it since it's
17:10 - really big it takes a lot of time to
17:11 - load
17:12 - uh if i have collab pro on another
17:14 - account i just
17:15 - didn't log in with it today but yeah as
17:17 - you can see this is a kde plot through
17:20 - the middle
17:20 - like so and on the sides there is a
17:23 - scatter plot
17:24 - uh so this is a kde plot also
17:27 - i mean not kd a pair plot and this there
17:30 - is
17:30 - a type on the side it's called the
17:33 - legion i'm pretty sure
17:34 - and it's used with the command heel also
17:37 - we have
17:38 - we're comparing the hp the attack the
17:40 - defense the special attack the special
17:42 - defense
17:42 - the speed and type 1 of each pokemon so
17:45 - we can see
17:46 - uh let's look at the speed with the hp
17:49 - so
17:50 - uh we can see that the more speed you
17:52 - have the less hp
17:54 - you'll get so like these uh we can see
17:57 - that it's more clumped around here
17:58 - because
17:58 - most of the pokemons have pretty good
18:00 - speed so they don't have too much hp
18:03 - uh let's look at another one okay let's
18:06 - look
18:07 - at a special attack with the speed
18:10 - so if your special attack does like 100
18:13 - damage then you'll have
18:14 - around 75 speed um and we can also tell
18:18 - by the kde
18:19 - uh plots that uh the information so
18:23 - if you have like 200 150 hp
18:27 - then let's scroll down did your oh no
18:29 - this is hp with hp
18:31 - so um it just goes together uh by the
18:34 - way these
18:34 - are all the same category as each other
18:37 - so the speed with speed
18:39 - um the special defense or the special
18:40 - defense so
18:42 - uh yeah you can't really rely on these
18:43 - since they're not as accurate since they
18:45 - are the same category
18:47 - but what you should be looking at is
18:48 - these scatter plots
18:50 - on the top right and the bottom left
18:54 - and let's move on to the strip plot um
18:56 - the strip plot uh
18:58 - we sometimes use a swarm plot instead of
19:00 - the strip plot
19:01 - but since the strip plot is better
19:03 - because
19:04 - it uses less room than the the swarm
19:07 - plot
19:08 - and it's kind of used like a box plot
19:10 - it's to find
19:11 - outliners but it doesn't do as good as a
19:13 - job as the box plot does
19:15 - so we can see here we have the special
19:17 - attack the special defense
19:18 - the attack and defense so we're going to
19:20 - compare all of them and we can see that
19:23 - uh there is outliners over here but we
19:25 - can't really cut them off anywhere
19:27 - uh like unlike the blocks plot which
19:30 - shows like
19:31 - very detailed like these are the
19:33 - outliners we have to like try to
19:36 - see by ourselves which one is going over
19:38 - and where is like the average of it
19:40 - so it's more harder to use than a box
19:42 - plot however for me it is more colorful
19:44 - and more
19:45 - fun to look at um than a box plot since
19:47 - it looks more colorful
19:49 - and simple um but yeah let's move on to
19:52 - the joint plot
19:53 - the joint plot we have the x-axis as the
19:56 - hp
19:57 - and the y-axis as the attack um and our
20:00 - data is
20:01 - of course our pokedata uh a drawing plot
20:04 - is just one big plot like so and there's
20:07 - histograms on the outside
20:08 - and inside there is the scatter plot so
20:11 - we're going to be comparing the attack
20:13 - in the hp
20:14 - so it looks like that the less of hp you
20:16 - have the more attack you have
20:19 - but the more hp then the less attack um
20:21 - these
20:22 - again are the outliners blissey and
20:24 - chancy
20:25 - um but yeah we can see that they have
20:27 - very low attack damage
20:29 - since they have a lot of hp so either
20:31 - goes both ways
20:32 - if you want a lot of hp and you have to
20:34 - sacrifice your attack
20:35 - but if you want a lot of attack then you
20:37 - have to sacrifice your hp
20:39 - so look at these ones uh they have like
20:42 - 200 no not 200 yeah 200 a roundish
20:45 - attack damage but their hp is not so
20:47 - good around 100
20:48 - um but yeah anyways that is the joint
20:51 - plot and
20:52 - let's move on to our last one which is
20:54 - the hiss plot or the histogram plot
20:56 - um the histogram plot you only need to
20:58 - set one
20:59 - axis since the other one will be the
21:01 - count
21:03 - it's kind of like the count plot but we
21:05 - can see uh
21:06 - that the x-axis that we're going to be
21:08 - using is the total
21:09 - um which is like as i said earlier the
21:12 - overall stats of the pokemon
21:14 - and to the y-axis we have the count or
21:17 - how much
21:18 - are in each category so at 500 total
21:22 - uh there is around 140 pokemons that has
21:24 - a total of 500
21:26 - um and there is like this like 700
21:31 - not 700 but around 700 uh
21:34 - total on one pokemon around so one
21:37 - pokemon has
21:38 - around 725 total
21:41 - also there is like two that has
21:44 - around 775 total which is really good
21:48 - um but yeah this is another way to look
21:51 - at
21:51 - uh pokemons in through graphs and
21:54 - through python
21:55 - uh it's a fun way to look at it and you
21:57 - can find some patterns throughout
21:58 - your journey looking at graphs so i hope
22:01 - you enjoyed this video
22:02 - uh and thank you very much for watching
22:04 - see you in the next one
22:07 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody welcome back to another video today i will be giving you a brief overview on uh seabourn pandas and matplotlib basically today we're going to be looking at patterns inside of the pokemon dataset which we found earlier in the uh other stream or video and we're going to be using this link for our information of pokemon i will leave it in the description basically it's just uh a page full of data's about pokemon there is the name the type 1 type 2 the hp the attack defense the special attack and the special defense at first i thought this was speed attack and speed defense but i was wrong it's actually special attack and special defense um there's the speed generation and legendary so we're gonna be using this data set uh for today's video um and today video we're just going to be looking at patterns inside of the pokemon data set using graphs so we're going to be trying to find like uh unique patterns that happen inside of this graph so let's begin first we got to import our libraries that we need which is pandas matplotlib.piplot and seaborn if you don't have these pip install yet then you should uh but with colab you don't need to you can just pip installed here by using this command exclamation point pip install and whatever you want after that uh like seaborn like so uh you can also do this with matplotlib and pandas but i would recommend you to go into your command prompt or cmd uh let me show you how so go into here type in cmd open it up and then type in a pip no exclamation point this time install matplotlib or pip install seaborn and uh last but not least pandas like this um and this will basically make sure that inside of your computer or python libraries there is going to be these libraries installed too i would recommend you to do that but you don't have to you can just install it from collab so once we have pip installed we want to import them and we're going to import pandas as pd um this is to use uh to shorten the names instead of having to type out pandas dot uh something or matplotlib dot pi plot dot seaborn dot we just need to type out pd.plt dot and sns dot uh which is really short and simple to use after that we need matplotlib inline uh this is so that we can display our graph instead of like having nothing if you don't have this then you won't be able to see the graphs so you must have this code now let's move on to the next one this will basically grab the pokemon data set we need so you might have already saw the link this is what it looks like uh it just has a bunch of pokemons uh type one type two the name and etc and we're gonna be grabbing this information and then we're gonna put it inside pokey data so uh this one basically grabs it and then it stores it inside a path so this is the path of a github content pokemon underscore dataset.csv uh use this one to get the path and then after that pokeydata equals to pd which is pandas.read.csv this will read the csv file um at the path and it will have index column goes to zero this will basically store our whole entire data set or this whole page right here into this variable or this pandas panda data frame pokey data and then now we have a data set of our own called pokedata let's run this oh shoot i forgot to run this one i keep on forgetting to import stuff once i get explaining i just lose track um but let's wait for it to connect to our google drive first and then it's it's going to come with an error for sure um but we just got to run this one and this one and this one so let's import our libraries okay and then after that we will grab the information and it will come up like a bunch of stuff here but don't worry this is correct it's not an error or anything 100 um so this is just make sure that stored in and then after that in here we'll just store the information into pokedata perfect now we have all our information inside of pokedata uh now this works as uh any data set would you can do uh like this one print out the type one it will only print out the column type one so we can see here it has 800 rows of type 1 and i'm not sure how much columns it has but we can also check by using this command pokeydata.com but we're not there yet first i want to do something actually let me show you something uh let's type in pokedata pokedata it would be good if we have this copied pokedata dot um not dot head which will print out the first five uh rows and all the columns like so and now here is what it looks like into a data frame uh there's the name type one type 2 everything that that page has uh and there is these which are the integers it's the hp the attack the defense the special attack the special defense and the speed um i will combine all of these into one column which i will call total uh in total it's just going to be the overall stats of the pokemon uh so in here we're going to make that happen so we're going to have pokedata brackets inside we will name our new column uh i named it total because it's uh what i want to name it you can name it anything like overall or uh that uh stats or anything um and this will equal to pokedata hp uh hp plus pokedata attack this one defense s special attack or speed first special attack special defense and then finally special oh i have two special attacks i'm so sorry i have two special attacks i'm supposed to have special defense oh how could i let this go okay so once we have that all added up we want to do is we want to run it so shift enter to run um and once you did that let's look at the columns so pokedata.com will just print out all the column names so we have name type 1 type 2 hp attack defense special attack special defense the speed the generation and legendary finally we have the new column which we just made called total if we were to run dot head again then we would have an extra uh an extra column here which is total okay let's move on um now we can just uh oh i have another head here it's okay i don't need that so now we can just move on to our graphs or our plots we're going to be starting off with the count plot um so let's run it this count plot will be about the type one so it will just list out how much type ones there are the xaxis is the type one as you can see and the yaxis is account account is basically how much pokemons are there or the number of it so there's uh above 100 pokemons with water type around 125 pokemons with water type and then we can see like uh 70 pokemons with grass types s um on and on uh also we can see that the least one is the flying type which is um around two pokemons with flying type as type one because this is because uh well all pokemons well not all pokemons but most of the pokemons can fly they have the ability to fly but it's not like their main uh ability like charizard like he can fly or it can fly um but they're the main type is fire and like uh articuno it's a legendary bird i'm pretty sure it's ice um it can fly but it's iced so type one is ice uh and zapdos uh moltres ho o and so on and so on they all can fly but it's not like their main type and also all the bug pokemons like um like i forget their name um no metapod no metapod can't fly what's the evolution of metapod uh b b drop b drill b drill okay be drill right if it's not then i'm gonna look like really dumb okay it's beedrill okay like virgil can fly but it's like a bug type so it's not really like the main type but since all pokemons can fly or not all but most of them can fly type 2 will probably be flying um i made a prediction that it would be flying because it's you know all pokemons can fly but it's not like their main ability so they probably put it in type two let's see so this one i changed it uh instead of having type one as the xaxis i made type two as the xaxis and you can see that flying just out outweighs every single uh type since uh you know not much not as much pokemons have uh these types as their type two most of them have it as their type one but you can see flying has like like most of the count because uh you know as i said earlier and he said this probably a hundred times but most pokemons can fly so they put their type two as flying however it's not like their main special ability so they don't put it as type one unless some special cases then maybe they put it as type one because we can see here that some pokemons do have flying as their type one okay let's move on to the box plot the box plot looks somewhat like this now i will explain to you in detail what this is it might look very confusing at first but trust me it's not so uh this colorful blocks no blocks box in the middle is the average or the regression of the entire uh of the range so this is the average um you can see all of this is the average and then the actual range itself is these two lines over here these two lines um so the hp i'm gonna compare between the hp the attack the defense and the speed so uh on the left side is just how much it is uh so in here the hp you can see that it's around the range or the average is around 125 to zero and then inside of that it has the regression which is around 50 to 75 so this is worth like the average hp is and that goes for the attack defense and speed however we can see these little diamond shapes these are called the outliners uh the outliners are like those um those people like maybe in your school or something that is like very good at something or very bad at something so these are the outliners either they're very good or too good in that category or too bad so we can see as a good example in hp here uh there is a bunch of outliners that is like exceeding the normal hp limit but you can see that there is one that has zero hp or one hp i'm not sure what this one is but you can see it's an outliner it has no hp at all but these ones have like a bunch of hp um and we can see that these two are very outstanding hp i'll give you a guess on which uh which pokemons are these uh your time is up but for me i since i play a lot of pokemon go i know that these two are probably chansey and blissy since they are very uh tank uh they tank a lot of hits like from the best attacker in pokemon go which is alkazam using sidestrike they can withstand a lot of hits too i watch a youtube video on it it's pretty cool it can like it it almost outweighs the gym time uh so whenever you battle a gym i'm gonna go off track a little but whenever you battle a gym you have a limited amount of time to beat it if you don't then you just get sent out and then you have to retry again but chansey can take a lot of hits and it takes like around half the time to kill chancy or to like knock it out and if there was like not chancy sorry blissey um and if pretend there was like three chant blisseys inside of the of the gym then you wouldn't have enough time to uh defeat the gym unless you defeat one of them and then get their hp low enough so you can defeat them quicker um the next round but yeah anyways i'm going off track chansey and blissey are very good at tanking uh and they are very high hp too and then yeah this is the box plot it helps us find the outliners and the medium or the regression line in the middle so yeah that's the box plot now let's look at the scatter plot the scatter plot is a bunch of dots and it kind of looked complicated but i'll explain to you very simply and i am using the x axis as defense and the y axis as attack so we can see if it correlates with each other or not so we can see here that it is not as like great uh so we can see that the more attack the less defense usually okay like over here the more attack you have the less defense you will have unless it's like a very good pokemon like this one it has pretty good defense and really good attack but most of it is around over here which is like okay defense okay attack but it's not like if you have more more defense then you have more attack it's kind of the opposite if you have more attack then you have less defense if you have more defense then you have less attack but like as you can see these are outliners which like they don't go under the same rules as other people and this is probably not chancy though not chancey or blissey since they do no damage at all even though they're really good at tanking they do like five attack damage they're really really weak for attacking but um yeah anyways they uh these are some outliners that don't follow the rules but most of the pokemon follow the rules and go like if you have a lot of attack then you have less defense you have a lot of defense then you don't have that much attack so this is a way to find out some patterns let's move on to lm plot lm plot uh i will show you right now it looks somewhat complicated as i said earlier but it's very simple so we can see there's a bunch of lines in the middle uh let me explain the lines first the lines are the average of uh the types so here we can see the types and uh this is because we put in the command hue equals to type one hue basically lets us um see in more detail of the graph if we don't have the command hue then this is what would look like it'll be all blue um it'll probably look a little bit more simple but it's not that detailed uh and we won't know what which dot is what type and each dot is a pokemon by the way so now if we do this we can see the type of the pokemon it might take a little while but here it comes so we can see each type so like this one we know it's like a water type um and like the blue one is probably like a rock or a ghost type uh but yeah we can see more detail of the graph and we can also see that let me show you these two up here um you probably know which one it is since it's like 250 hp and 255 hp and i'll give you a hint they're both uh where is it they're both is chanting normal type i think chansey is normal type right uh chansey type type probably normal type yeah so it's normal type so we can see here that since it's normal type uh and there's a lot of hp it's probably chancy and blissy since we already looked at that um but yeah so we can see the types of each pokemon and we can see like the average of each type through the lines and looks like most of them are around here around 50 hp to 150 hp from uh 200 total to 500 total somewhere so yeah this is uh the average line of pokemons but as i said earlier there is some outliners that don't follow the rules and they just do like uh amazing at something or really bad at something okay let's move on to the pair plot the pair plot looks somewhat like this sorry if there's a big sound in the background but anyways the pair plot looks uh it's kind of slow because it's a it's a big plot um but it has scatter plots on the side and through the middle it's a histogram okay one second um because it since it's really big it takes a lot of time to load uh if i have collab pro on another account i just didn't log in with it today but yeah as you can see this is a kde plot through the middle like so and on the sides there is a scatter plot uh so this is a kde plot also i mean not kd a pair plot and this there is a type on the side it's called the legion i'm pretty sure and it's used with the command heel also we have we're comparing the hp the attack the defense the special attack the special defense the speed and type 1 of each pokemon so we can see uh let's look at the speed with the hp so uh we can see that the more speed you have the less hp you'll get so like these uh we can see that it's more clumped around here because most of the pokemons have pretty good speed so they don't have too much hp uh let's look at another one okay let's look at a special attack with the speed so if your special attack does like 100 damage then you'll have around 75 speed um and we can also tell by the kde uh plots that uh the information so if you have like 200 150 hp then let's scroll down did your oh no this is hp with hp so um it just goes together uh by the way these are all the same category as each other so the speed with speed um the special defense or the special defense so uh yeah you can't really rely on these since they're not as accurate since they are the same category but what you should be looking at is these scatter plots on the top right and the bottom left and let's move on to the strip plot um the strip plot uh we sometimes use a swarm plot instead of the strip plot but since the strip plot is better because it uses less room than the the swarm plot and it's kind of used like a box plot it's to find outliners but it doesn't do as good as a job as the box plot does so we can see here we have the special attack the special defense the attack and defense so we're going to compare all of them and we can see that uh there is outliners over here but we can't really cut them off anywhere uh like unlike the blocks plot which shows like very detailed like these are the outliners we have to like try to see by ourselves which one is going over and where is like the average of it so it's more harder to use than a box plot however for me it is more colorful and more fun to look at um than a box plot since it looks more colorful and simple um but yeah let's move on to the joint plot the joint plot we have the xaxis as the hp and the yaxis as the attack um and our data is of course our pokedata uh a drawing plot is just one big plot like so and there's histograms on the outside and inside there is the scatter plot so we're going to be comparing the attack in the hp so it looks like that the less of hp you have the more attack you have but the more hp then the less attack um these again are the outliners blissey and chancy um but yeah we can see that they have very low attack damage since they have a lot of hp so either goes both ways if you want a lot of hp and you have to sacrifice your attack but if you want a lot of attack then you have to sacrifice your hp so look at these ones uh they have like 200 no not 200 yeah 200 a roundish attack damage but their hp is not so good around 100 um but yeah anyways that is the joint plot and let's move on to our last one which is the hiss plot or the histogram plot um the histogram plot you only need to set one axis since the other one will be the count it's kind of like the count plot but we can see uh that the xaxis that we're going to be using is the total um which is like as i said earlier the overall stats of the pokemon and to the yaxis we have the count or how much are in each category so at 500 total uh there is around 140 pokemons that has a total of 500 um and there is like this like 700 not 700 but around 700 uh total on one pokemon around so one pokemon has around 725 total also there is like two that has around 775 total which is really good um but yeah this is another way to look at uh pokemons in through graphs and through python uh it's a fun way to look at it and you can find some patterns throughout your journey looking at graphs so i hope you enjoyed this video uh and thank you very much for watching see you in the next one bye
