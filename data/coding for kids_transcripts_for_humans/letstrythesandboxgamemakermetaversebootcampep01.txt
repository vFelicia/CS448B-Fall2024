00:00 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:02 - today i will be giving you a brief
00:04 - overview on
00:06 - uh
00:07 - sandbox game maker a very exciting game
00:10 - maker and it's very fun you can do a lot
00:14 - of things with it
00:15 - and i'll show you how to work with it
00:17 - but first let's know what sandbox is
00:19 - sandbox is a
00:22 - basically a
00:23 - game that is located inside of the
00:25 - metaverse it's like a multiplayer game
00:29 - you can play with other people but
00:30 - instead of being any regular game you
00:32 - can actually buy land you can do stuff
00:35 - with your land um like make a business
00:38 - or something and you can exchange coins
00:41 - which is sand it's called can the
00:43 - currency is sand like ours would be
00:46 - bought or dollars but in the game it's
00:48 - called sand um there are three main
00:50 - components of sandbox of course there is
00:53 - the voxel edit which will let you design
00:56 - 3d models there is the marketplace which
00:59 - allows you to sell stuff and um get
01:02 - stuff and there is the
01:05 - game editor which is
01:07 - what i'm doing right now if you want to
01:09 - know
01:10 - more about the
01:12 - um
01:13 - the voxel
01:15 - edit then go check out my sister's
01:17 - channel it's the strawberry and it's
01:19 - link in the description uh af you should
01:21 - thank me for the shout out
01:24 - okay what
01:26 - yeah you should thank me for the shout
01:28 - out
01:29 - what i don't want to shout out anyways
01:32 - let's move on to
01:34 - uh the game mode
01:37 - okay let's move on to the game editor so
01:41 - first off i'm not going to be showing
01:43 - you how to i'm not going to be
01:44 - explaining i'm going to do step by step
01:46 - but anyways this is just uh
01:49 - what we're going to be doing today it's
01:51 - going to look somewhat like this
01:53 - so you have a player right here
01:55 - and you can walk around i'm not sure if
01:57 - the sound is too loud or not but yeah
01:59 - basically you have a player
02:01 - um and there is some mobs or like some
02:04 - entities for you to fight
02:07 - and you can fight against them like that
02:09 - oh
02:10 - i was looking at obs um but yeah you can
02:12 - fight with them uh
02:15 - and you can like hop around on the
02:17 - stairs and stuff
02:18 - uh and yeah you can do a lot of stuff
02:20 - it's with 3d
02:22 - so yeah
02:24 - it's very
02:26 - uh has a lot of uh how you call it
02:30 - it has a lot of different varieties you
02:32 - can do
02:34 - um there is different mobs you can work
02:36 - with too
02:38 - there's these mobs and i will be showing
02:40 - you
02:41 - how to do all of this how to have the
02:43 - victory and everything so yeah let's get
02:46 - started so first of all let us go back
02:49 - into the home screen um you should
02:51 - probably download your sandbox game
02:54 - maker first and it would look something
02:56 - like this when you come into it and in
02:58 - here you will have three which is three
03:01 - options my games templates and galleries
03:03 - templates is like going to teach you
03:05 - some lessons and stuff uh you can click
03:07 - on there and you can experiment around
03:09 - with it gallery is what other people did
03:11 - before and you can go check it out for
03:13 - yourself um i played some of them
03:15 - already and they are pretty fun um was
03:18 - asked why oscar a camping warrior and
03:22 - etc they are really good they the people
03:24 - who made them are talented um but today
03:27 - i will be showing you the physics and
03:28 - how to pan around it how to zoom in zoom
03:31 - out how to add some uh how to delete
03:34 - stuff how to add stuff how to make mobs
03:37 - attack you etc and how to have a sword
03:39 - even so stick around until the end of
03:42 - the video because this video is
03:43 - jam-packed with facts so let's enter in
03:46 - our experience name so what you want to
03:49 - do is click here and then after that
03:51 - just enter in your name i will enter
03:52 - this tutorial like so and here you can
03:56 - select a grid to one by one two by two
04:00 - um and all of these grids however i am
04:02 - going to be doing one by one since it
04:04 - will not lag your computer as much if
04:06 - you do four by four it's quite big and i
04:08 - find that quite unnecessary one by one
04:10 - is big enough uh like my other game it
04:12 - was a one by one and i still had plenty
04:14 - of space to do what i wanted to do so
04:16 - one by one it lets you work with it
04:18 - without lag so let's click on one by one
04:21 - you can also select the theme um and
04:23 - there's multiple themes for you like
04:25 - it's going to be terrain kind of ish and
04:27 - there's going to be like whatever it
04:29 - says there's going to be a lake desert
04:30 - nether meadow antarctica jungle island
04:33 - etc but i will be doing it on empty
04:36 - since we can design our own things so
04:38 - once we do that we're going to click
04:39 - create and it will come into the loading
04:41 - page
04:42 - once we did that we will hop into a
04:44 - screen like this and what you want to do
04:46 - first is if you are experienced with
04:48 - games then you can move around with w a
04:51 - s d w is forwards s is backwards a is
04:55 - left and d is right okay so those are
04:58 - the controls to move around and you can
05:00 - zoom and zoom out um
05:02 - to basically get the fov you want you
05:06 - can also
05:07 - pan around like this doing a 360. with
05:10 - the
05:11 - um controls q and e
05:13 - q and e um q is to go turn pan right e
05:16 - is to pan left
05:18 - and the difference between holding a is
05:21 - a just lets you on like um to the side
05:24 - but cue actually
05:26 - wraps around like this um
05:29 - if you want to
05:30 - uh basically rotate around like a
05:32 - certain object like this one
05:34 - press alt and then click on the space
05:36 - you want the camera to rotate around so
05:38 - i want to rotate around this spawn point
05:41 - so alt click and there we go you can
05:43 - drag your mouse around while holding alt
05:46 - and it will be something like this which
05:48 - is pretty cool and that is basically the
05:51 - basic controls of course there is middle
05:54 - click too which helps you pan around
05:55 - like this basically wasd but just it's
05:58 - quicker um anyways there is more
06:01 - commands but i will not be showing you
06:04 - every single one since i already showed
06:06 - you the basics and what you should use
06:08 - so there we go that is the command and
06:10 - let's get to building so how to place a
06:13 - block you might wonder uh what you want
06:15 - to do is if if you ever played minecraft
06:17 - before this is kind of like minecraft
06:20 - click l or in minecraft you would click
06:22 - e but this one's l and now we can take a
06:25 - look at the stuff we have so we have
06:28 - blocks if you click on blocks there is
06:30 - going to be
06:31 - blocks for you to choose and how you can
06:33 - build with um i will be choosing a
06:37 - dirt brown okay a dirt brown okay once
06:40 - we chose our block we will just simply
06:43 - drag it into our inventory or hot bar so
06:46 - i drag into my first slot then after
06:49 - that i can have uh i'll have another one
06:52 - i'll have cobblestone with grass
06:55 - and i will have a
06:58 - asphalt
06:59 - lining like this one
07:01 - actually no i'll have a
07:04 - asphalt with clean white and black
07:07 - there so now once my hot bar is filled i
07:09 - press l again and then it will get me to
07:12 - this page um you can click on this arrow
07:15 - to hide in or out the hud
07:17 - and yeah so now once we have our hotbar
07:20 - slot filled with four blocks the way to
07:22 - place it is um not like minecraft
07:25 - minecraft uh if you hold left click then
07:28 - it will be breaking the blocks and if
07:30 - you press right click then it will be
07:31 - placing it but it's just opposite in
07:33 - here so you click left to place it click
07:36 - right on the block to delete it so let's
07:39 - place it down first so let's build like
07:41 - a house or something around this spawn
07:43 - point um so the way to zoom not zoom but
07:47 - to have a top down view is to hold alt
07:49 - and
07:50 - hold your not your scroll wheel sorry
07:52 - your left click and now we can build
07:55 - whatever we want like
07:56 - this
07:58 - okay
08:00 - like so and now we build uh one two
08:03 - three four five a five by five uh
08:07 - thing i think sorry house um around our
08:12 - spawn point and of course we can do much
08:14 - more but i'll just show you how to place
08:15 - and break blocks first
08:17 - so here we place all our blocks
08:20 - so it's now three blocks high okay and
08:23 - then you can place it
08:25 - into like this
08:28 - okay
08:30 - you can change your point of view to get
08:31 - an easier
08:33 - um
08:34 - easier way to
08:36 - not wait easier uh
08:38 - angle to put your blocks so now if we
08:40 - want to play our game what we want to do
08:42 - is we want to press tab and then it will
08:45 - basically switch from editor to play so
08:48 - if you hold tab it will go like this and
08:50 - now you spawn in here um in our little
08:52 - dirt hut that we made like so and you
08:56 - can actually be the player and you can
08:57 - run around
08:59 - and uh to punch something let me
09:01 - actually get an entity for this so the
09:03 - way to get an entity is you want to go
09:06 - into your library again and click on the
09:08 - entity right here entity library you can
09:11 - get any of them i guess um but i will
09:15 - get the beaver
09:17 - like so place a beaver down and once you
09:20 - did that what we want to do is we want
09:22 - to click on this thing right here um and
09:25 - once you click on the beaver you can
09:27 - actually assign this is to move by the
09:29 - way um
09:30 - if you click on this thing and you click
09:32 - on the beaver you can actually assign
09:34 - the behaviors that it has so right now
09:36 - it's on prey and what prey does is
09:38 - basically if there's a predator around
09:40 - when the predator is hungry it will
09:42 - chase the prey i will show you that
09:44 - example later but what you want to do is
09:46 - we want to just punch it first i guess
09:48 - um
09:49 - so we'll just have it as a
09:52 - as
09:53 - maybe uh maybe a melee enemy which will
09:56 - actually attack us back but if we turn
09:58 - all these down then it won't attack us
10:00 - anymore but anyways we will now be able
10:03 - to punch this thing
10:04 - so let's hold press tab again as you can
10:07 - see it comes comes after us immediately
10:10 - because it's a melee enemy um and this
10:13 - one you can use for your mobs uh the way
10:16 - to if it actually gets close it can bite
10:19 - you and you can notice that your health
10:21 - will actually go down from that so
10:24 - uh if you have a melee enemy stay away
10:25 - from them um anyways if you left click
10:28 - while you're a player you can hit them
10:30 - like that and you can see that i did
10:32 - nine damage to the beaver um hey she'll
10:35 - feel for a second shield so you can
10:38 - you can also hold sprint uh not hold
10:40 - sprint hold shift to sprint away like
10:42 - this
10:44 - and then uh you can run faster than the
10:46 - beaver you can
10:48 - press spacebar to jump
10:50 - and you can hold right click to block
10:53 - with your sword blocking with your sword
10:55 - will allow you to not take any damage
10:58 - like this
10:59 - and there is one very important fact
11:02 - that we should know is that if we uh
11:05 - block right as they attack then it will
11:08 - be a perfect parry and what it does is
11:09 - basically it will um stun them for a
11:12 - second and it will basically make them
11:15 - uh dazed and which will allow you to get
11:17 - some free hits without them attacking
11:19 - you so let me try
11:22 - oh i'm sorry he attacked me so
11:25 - what trick is to wait until it's red and
11:26 - there we go perfect parry and you can
11:28 - see these days and now you can get some
11:30 - free hits off them um it's if you think
11:33 - about it it's like a survival game it's
11:35 - pretty fun uh but yeah
11:38 - that is my explanation i'm of
11:42 - but anyways you can kill them and if you
11:45 - hold down left click you actually
11:46 - recharge your super power like this and
11:50 - it will do more damage to them and it
11:52 - will go through if they block if they
11:54 - block you can do this
11:56 - and it will go through their shield so
11:58 - yeah that is some basic controls there's
12:00 - another one which is if you hold if you
12:02 - press shift with left click you'll
12:06 - and forward i guess
12:08 - oh yeah you'll lunge attack so
12:11 - it's quite hard to do yeah there we go
12:13 - so um
12:15 - w shift left click will let you throw
12:18 - like a thrust attack i'm pretty sure
12:19 - that's what they call it
12:21 - thrust attack
12:23 - okay there we go see it thrusts itself
12:25 - forward so you have to be
12:27 - oh
12:29 - well that's roll
12:31 - there's some thrust it's really hard to
12:32 - get for some reason
12:34 - there you go so shift and then forward
12:36 - and left click at the same time so shift
12:38 - first forward left click yeah there we
12:41 - go
12:42 - shift forward left click shift forward
12:44 - left click there we go so that is how to
12:46 - rust attack and to roll is i'm pretty
12:49 - sure shift
12:50 - and um
12:52 - left click right
12:54 - oh
12:55 - okay um never mind it's not that but
12:58 - what we can do if we're not sure is we
12:59 - can click on options click on settings
13:02 - uh controls and now we can actually see
13:05 - the controls quick combo attack um
13:08 - and etc so actually let me go back there
13:11 - please
13:12 - okay there okay now we can see how to do
13:16 - stuff um
13:17 - so
13:18 - where is it heavy attack hold
13:22 - um
13:23 - hold uh the left click which is the
13:25 - super power first attack is w and left
13:28 - click perry is that dodge is just
13:31 - uh w
13:32 - right and
13:34 - show hide life is l okay so uh dodge is
13:38 - just w
13:40 - hello
13:41 - i'm pretty new oh oh
13:45 - oh i got it for some reason but i don't
13:47 - oh oh it's just shipped it's just shift
13:51 - okay to dodge is just shift
13:54 - and you will dodge and i'm pretty sure
13:55 - to dodge attack
13:59 - there is a dodge attack but i'm not sure
14:02 - what it is but you can dodge or roll
14:04 - with chip
14:05 - like this okay anyways let's get back to
14:08 - our editor so once we're in here i'm
14:10 - going to delete this little creature
14:12 - over here how you can delete something
14:14 - is you click on a block or something
14:17 - or anything basically and you right
14:19 - click on them oops
14:21 - never mind that's for blocks um how to
14:23 - delete an entity is to click over here
14:26 - click on the entity and delete there we
14:28 - go and that's how you delete an entity
14:31 - um now let's actually make a course so
14:34 - our character can fight uh enemy and
14:37 - actually ha uh
14:39 - win the game
14:41 - so i'm going to make a little pathway oh
14:43 - and let's do some parkour too cause you
14:45 - know
14:46 - it's quite cool okay so the way to
14:48 - delete a massive chunk is to just uh let
14:52 - let's pretend we have uh let's build
14:54 - something a lot right we don't need to
14:56 - keep on placing it like this i forgot
14:57 - you can actually hold down left click
14:59 - and you can drag to create a grid out of
15:02 - how big you want instead of just placing
15:04 - it one by one so now we have a really
15:05 - big grid and the way to delete it is to
15:08 - hold right
15:09 - uh and then just delete your thing so
15:11 - that applies for the ground too uh you
15:13 - can delete a massive patch then refill
15:16 - it like this
15:17 - um and you can delete this again or
15:19 - something but yeah you can
15:21 - not waste your time and you can delete a
15:23 - whole chunk at a time
15:25 - so now once we have a pretty
15:27 - long path i will actually make this a
15:29 - bit longer so that we have room for some
15:32 - parkour
15:33 - okay
15:34 - okay there we go so now once we parkour
15:37 - over there there will be
15:39 - an ending over here
15:40 - so we will let's create some parkour
15:42 - blocks shall we
15:44 - so let's have uh like this
15:47 - and then like this
15:49 - and then
15:51 - even higher three blocks
15:53 - and then one really really really really
15:55 - far away
15:57 - three blocks two and then let's just
15:58 - delete a little bit more
16:01 - and then like this and then this is
16:03 - where the boss fights happen and if we
16:05 - weren't if we run our code right now we
16:08 - can actually try it like this
16:11 - oops there you go and of course you can
16:14 - um
16:15 - sprint while you're jumping which will
16:17 - increase the jump length
16:19 - but i did it so that you don't need to
16:21 - sprint because sometimes people forget
16:24 - to sprint and they just fall off so yeah
16:27 - and now what we're gonna do is right now
16:30 - if you fall over here it basically does
16:32 - nothing um you can just start over again
16:35 - but what we want to do is we want
16:37 - if you fall into here on this part um
16:40 - then you will basically die and then you
16:43 - will come back to your checkpoint over
16:45 - here
16:46 - and then you will just do it again so
16:48 - let's make that first we have to elevate
16:50 - each one by one no actually we can just
16:52 - delete it but that's too
16:54 - much work so i will just elevate it by
16:56 - one
16:58 - like this um and it should still work
17:02 - there we go okay it still works um and
17:04 - we're gonna fill this part with lava
17:07 - or any block of your choice
17:09 - um so once we
17:11 - do that we will click l and i will
17:13 - search for
17:14 - lava there we go i'll get lava here and
17:18 - we will press l again
17:20 - and we'll just fill up this space right
17:22 - here with some lava
17:25 - um
17:28 - actually i'm pretty sure i can just
17:30 - yeah i'm pretty sure i can just do oh
17:32 - sorry
17:33 - i'm pretty sure i can just hold it and
17:36 - oh
17:37 - okay there we go and now the whole thing
17:39 - is filled with lava we can have little
17:41 - uh barriers on the side to make sure
17:43 - they can't escape
17:45 - like so
17:47 - um
17:48 - there we go
17:49 - a player is two blocks high by the way
17:52 - so once we did that let's try it out
17:55 - and of course the lava is not gonna kill
17:57 - us yet because we didn't program it too
17:59 - so if we were still in the lava it
18:01 - wouldn't do anything
18:02 - we can come back up here and then we can
18:04 - redo it but let's make sure that the
18:06 - lava actually kills us so how we do that
18:09 - is we can go into uh global parameters
18:11 - right here
18:13 - or
18:14 - global parameters go into controller
18:18 - on components
18:19 - uh so this is what the player will get
18:21 - hurt by and we can see over here
18:23 - damaging blocks so uh we want the lava
18:26 - to be the damaging blocks right so let's
18:28 - put some
18:30 - lava in here click on the lava
18:32 - by the way click here to edit it so once
18:34 - you do that press lava and block damage
18:37 - meaning how much damage should it do
18:40 - if we want all one hit meaning we have
18:42 - 100 health for a player we can set this
18:44 - to 100 which will insta kill once we did
18:47 - that it should kill us
18:49 - if we press tab again
18:51 - there we go it insta kills um
18:55 - oh and there you go that is the basics
18:57 - of
18:58 - of the parkour course okay i should make
19:01 - a little starting area maybe i should
19:02 - delete the house because you know it's
19:05 - kind of in the way so yeah let's uh
19:08 - delete the house
19:09 - so again deleting is pretty simple just
19:12 - you do this
19:13 - um i will delete this
19:16 - it's really easy to delete too
19:18 - because you know we can delete a whole
19:20 - chunk at a time
19:22 - there we go and now we have a starting
19:24 - area over here we can move the starting
19:26 - area by clicking on this thing and then
19:28 - we can click on the starting area and we
19:30 - can use these xy coordinates to move it
19:32 - or we can click on the plane right here
19:34 - to move it around but i will just use
19:36 - the xy coordinates since they are more
19:38 - accurate
19:39 - and once we did that we can just
19:40 - surround it back by
19:42 - uh
19:43 - these blocks so they can't escape
19:48 - there we go
19:50 - i why i was placing one by one but there
19:53 - so now we have
19:55 - our starting area
19:57 - like this and it's much better because
19:59 - there is nothing blocking you from
20:01 - jumping
20:02 - like this and you made it to the end so
20:06 - yeah that is the parkour course and
20:08 - let's add some enemies at the end so
20:11 - when they kill the enemies um we can win
20:13 - so let's add some space for the enemies
20:16 - let me use the white one now
20:19 - oh that's the black one oh my i
20:21 - accidentally deleted the white one um
20:24 - let me go search for it
20:26 - white asphalt
20:27 - there we go and we put it back into our
20:29 - hotbar slot okay now we can place it oh
20:32 - that's that's number four
20:35 - okay let's place it back okay there we
20:38 - go and now let's build a little wall
20:40 - here
20:41 - oh no i don't want to build with the
20:42 - same one
20:44 - okay
20:45 - oops
20:47 - okay like this
20:50 - and like this
20:53 - and now you can uh for the mob you can
20:55 - do any any mob you want uh
20:59 - and any entity sorry any entity you want
21:02 - so as long as it works
21:05 - so
21:06 - once we are done with this we will let's
21:10 - uh put in the entity so what entity
21:12 - shall we put in i was thinking of
21:14 - putting in the beaver but then i didn't
21:16 - really like killing it that time because
21:18 - it made me feel bad but
21:20 - let's try uh another entity
21:23 - uh maybe an evil one so i don't feel so
21:25 - bad about killing it
21:27 - okay um
21:30 - there's camels they're oh here here all
21:33 - right here are the evil ones there is
21:34 - detector defector block bot three
21:38 - um or defector bot i will get defector
21:40 - bot three since it looks way more evil
21:43 - oh so we put into our hot bar slot
21:46 - press l
21:47 - and we'll place it right in the center
21:50 - there we go that
21:51 - it looks like a chicken
21:53 - it looks like a chicken
21:55 - but um anyways this is our defector bot
21:58 - this i realized it was the back of it
22:00 - let me
22:01 - spin around hey there we go looks like a
22:03 - chicken um but anyways we oh oh i didn't
22:06 - mean to place it um we can control z
22:09 - like so and we can assign the behaviors
22:12 - by clicking on this then clicking on our
22:14 - entity
22:16 - and we can assign a physic
22:18 - uh do we want it to be collision
22:20 - collision means that when the player
22:21 - runs into it he can't just run through
22:23 - and i would recommend to put it on yes
22:26 - uh and then collision plus gravity i
22:28 - recommend no because if it is then it
22:30 - will just go flying so just collision
22:33 - and you can even name it i will name
22:35 - this chicken bot
22:37 - because it looks like a chicken and once
22:39 - we did that we can assign the behavior
22:41 - so right now it is assigned as melee
22:43 - enemy which means it will attack us and
22:45 - we can change the
22:47 - the how you call it the stats by
22:49 - ourselves right now it's on all maxed
22:52 - meaning it's the strongest um we can
22:55 - there's the health and we can add the
22:56 - component a component will basically
22:59 - let us uh
23:01 - win or lose so we can press on victory
23:05 - and we can do on death so when this dies
23:07 - it will become victory
23:14 - okay and now let's add it so that it can
23:17 - um
23:18 - block hits i am pretty sure it's
23:20 - somewhere around uh
23:23 - here
23:24 - i'm not sure though
23:26 - okay there press on edit logic and now
23:28 - you can have a bunch more uh
23:32 - a bunch more options so now we can do
23:34 - can block attack equals to true
23:36 - and now it will be able to block our
23:39 - attacks
23:40 - attack range we can make it this wide
23:43 - health is here
23:45 - uh and yeah there it is
23:49 - we can make it invincible too but
23:51 - anyways that is it so let it let us try
23:54 - of course this is not the finished
23:56 - product this is just a prototype
23:58 - and we can jump here jump there
24:00 - like so
24:02 - and then it realizes but since it's
24:04 - smart it doesn't come here because you
24:06 - know it's not high enough oh
24:09 - i didn't mean to i didn't know running
24:11 - forward would i mean pressing this uh
24:15 - oh no
24:16 - i didn't know pressing the left click
24:18 - would send me forward
24:21 - oh okay there you go so oh my gosh you
24:24 - know i just run on the wall
24:26 - okay for the sake of the video i will
24:28 - run on the wall of course you can make
24:30 - your wall higher um you can even make it
24:32 - invisible which what i will do
24:35 - but to make it not uh to make it cleaner
24:38 - but anyways let's resume uh like there
24:40 - is no gap okay so once we are here we
24:44 - can just hop in and we can start
24:46 - fighting like this
24:48 - but as you can see he's blocking every
24:49 - single hit a way to uh
24:52 - basically fix this problem is to every
24:55 - time he's going to hit you
24:57 - you block it perfectly oh sorry you
25:00 - blocked it perfectly
25:02 - so now you get a perfect parry which
25:04 - will daze him and you get some hits off
25:06 - him too
25:08 - like so
25:11 - and now you win like so um pretty simple
25:14 - pretty fun to do um it's very easy to
25:17 - code which i like i don't like like uh
25:20 - coding where it's like
25:22 - hard to
25:24 - do this coding is very simple you don't
25:26 - need any experience at all and you can
25:28 - do this
25:29 - um and yeah you can have fun with it
25:32 - all you want there's also another trick
25:34 - i want to show you is if you do your
25:36 - super attack
25:38 - it goes through his shield too so yeah
25:40 - that's pretty fun anyways you can make
25:43 - him a little bit more buff by
25:46 - uh making yourself more nerfed
25:48 - so let's go into the player settings
25:51 - which is in global parameters and go
25:53 - into
25:54 - a player controller and go into
25:57 - components but not components avatar
25:59 - sorry and we can go down here and we can
26:01 - look on
26:02 - sword and shield turn those into none
26:06 - so that now the players need to use
26:08 - their fist okay
26:10 - [Music]
26:14 - okay once we did that we can now close
26:15 - this up
26:16 - and we can do it again so now
26:20 - now players only have their fist to
26:22 - block and hit which will do less damage
26:24 - of course
26:28 - okay now you can block it while they're
26:29 - doing it so three two one
26:32 - there we go
26:35 - okay
26:37 - oh oh okay
26:38 - so we can oh sorry we can still use our
26:41 - magic power by the way even though we
26:44 - don't have any sword now oh no i'm
26:46 - really bad at parkour
26:48 - and there's also a little secret i want
26:50 - to show you at the end so stay tuned to
26:52 - find out about it
26:54 - there we go one hit and victory
26:57 - so now let's make the walls invisible
27:00 - first let's make it so that they are
27:02 - taller than the player so they can't
27:04 - jump out
27:05 - so oops
27:07 - okay
27:09 - let me zoom out a little bit
27:10 - okay there and now we will make it one
27:12 - more higher
27:14 - actually we should make it two more
27:15 - because
27:16 - one more wouldn't be enough
27:19 - okay place blocks okay there we go
27:23 - oh
27:26 - okay
27:27 - there we go
27:29 - i remember there was there but i just
27:30 - can't find it now but if i ever find it
27:33 - then i will tell you guys however right
27:35 - now i can't seem to find it so we're
27:37 - gonna have to stick with this wall first
27:39 - so let us play it again and now i'm
27:41 - pretty sure you can't
27:43 - jump out right
27:46 - yeah you can't jump out anymore
27:48 - even with the tallest one you can't jump
27:50 - because you're not two blocks high i
27:52 - mean you are more than two blocks high
27:56 - uh so now oh you can still jump out over
27:58 - here so let us edit that
28:02 - okay let me
28:04 - put this thing oh we had to change it
28:05 - back to free
28:07 - oh that was not the block this is okay
28:10 - okay
28:11 - there we go
28:14 - like oh no
28:16 - okay like this
28:19 - and there now you cannot jump out
28:23 - okay
28:26 - okay now you can just
28:28 - one shot this but i don't want to do
28:30 - that because it's not interesting
28:33 - so let's get a perfect parry and let's
28:36 - open okay three two one
28:41 - okay now we can just beat him up there
28:44 - we go and victory um there's also a
28:47 - thing where you can go into first person
28:49 - which is quite interesting so get a
28:52 - camera and get to first person
28:54 - and place on head equals to yes so now
28:56 - it will be first person and it will look
28:58 - much cooler when you're doing the
28:59 - parkour
29:01 - but you can't really see too much of
29:03 - yourself you can see sometimes your
29:04 - sword and your shadow
29:06 - but other than that you can't really see
29:07 - too much
29:09 - let me drink some water
29:13 - and when you're doing the parkour it
29:15 - looks really insane it looks really cool
29:18 - like you're in vr but when you're
29:20 - fighting
29:21 - it doesn't look too
29:22 - insane because you can't really see the
29:24 - health but anyways let's do some parkour
29:27 - so you can do like this
29:30 - oh okay okay okay
29:32 - okay there we go
29:33 - looks really cool
29:35 - but when you're fighting it looks kind
29:36 - of scary in real life oh
29:40 - okay
29:41 - ah no i fell
29:44 - so let's try to fight in oh no
29:47 - let's try to find first person so we can
29:49 - actually experience it no
29:51 - if i can actually complete the parkour
29:55 - okay if i don't make this i will just
29:56 - put the spawning point over here yeah
29:58 - okay i'm just gonna put the spawning
29:59 - point over there it's my you know what
30:02 - it's okay i'll just put it here because
30:03 - that's gonna screw up the point of the
30:05 - parkour
30:06 - oh okay
30:08 - there we go okay now i made it i made it
30:10 - and i'll just jump in here
30:12 - fight fight oh
30:14 - and you can block it but
30:16 - you ca you can tell when he attacks so
30:18 - you try to block it
30:21 - for perfect perry
30:23 - okay definitely not definitely not
30:24 - perfect perry perfect parry
30:28 - oh it was yeah i got it so that is um
30:32 - the
30:32 - how do you call it that is first person
30:35 - we can actually add more stuff so we can
30:37 - click on rules over here and we can do
30:39 - welcoming players
30:41 - um camera welcome and then we can just
30:44 - uh
30:45 - do whatever we want i will do this world
30:47 - center no actually i'll do avatar so now
30:50 - we will basically be able to call
30:51 - ourself the level name is going to be
30:55 - chicken
30:56 - chicken parkour
30:58 - like so oh parkhuro
31:01 - parkour
31:02 - and we will have our description which
31:05 - is
31:06 - complete

31:12 - kill
31:13 - the evil
31:15 - chicken
31:16 - robot chicken robot
31:20 - like this and we can actually assign
31:22 - some music to it but i'm not going to be
31:24 - doing that today you can do that but uh
31:27 - i will not um it you can feel free to do
31:29 - that but i am not going to do that for
31:31 - today so if we were to pray not play
31:34 - right now you can see that it like

31:43 - starting an adventure in chicken parkour

31:53 - okay there we go no
31:55 - okay and we can just complete it again
31:59 - if i can do that but yeah that is the
32:01 - basics of game editor of course i still
32:04 - don't know a lot so if i get some facts
32:07 - wrong then um it's my first time so
32:10 - don't judge me too hard oh i just

32:40 - hope you like it and see you in the next
32:42 - video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be giving you a brief overview on uh sandbox game maker a very exciting game maker and it's very fun you can do a lot of things with it and i'll show you how to work with it but first let's know what sandbox is sandbox is a basically a game that is located inside of the metaverse it's like a multiplayer game you can play with other people but instead of being any regular game you can actually buy land you can do stuff with your land um like make a business or something and you can exchange coins which is sand it's called can the currency is sand like ours would be bought or dollars but in the game it's called sand um there are three main components of sandbox of course there is the voxel edit which will let you design 3d models there is the marketplace which allows you to sell stuff and um get stuff and there is the game editor which is what i'm doing right now if you want to know more about the um the voxel edit then go check out my sister's channel it's the strawberry and it's link in the description uh af you should thank me for the shout out okay what yeah you should thank me for the shout out what i don't want to shout out anyways let's move on to uh the game mode okay let's move on to the game editor so first off i'm not going to be showing you how to i'm not going to be explaining i'm going to do step by step but anyways this is just uh what we're going to be doing today it's going to look somewhat like this so you have a player right here and you can walk around i'm not sure if the sound is too loud or not but yeah basically you have a player um and there is some mobs or like some entities for you to fight and you can fight against them like that oh i was looking at obs um but yeah you can fight with them uh and you can like hop around on the stairs and stuff uh and yeah you can do a lot of stuff it's with 3d so yeah it's very uh has a lot of uh how you call it it has a lot of different varieties you can do um there is different mobs you can work with too there's these mobs and i will be showing you how to do all of this how to have the victory and everything so yeah let's get started so first of all let us go back into the home screen um you should probably download your sandbox game maker first and it would look something like this when you come into it and in here you will have three which is three options my games templates and galleries templates is like going to teach you some lessons and stuff uh you can click on there and you can experiment around with it gallery is what other people did before and you can go check it out for yourself um i played some of them already and they are pretty fun um was asked why oscar a camping warrior and etc they are really good they the people who made them are talented um but today i will be showing you the physics and how to pan around it how to zoom in zoom out how to add some uh how to delete stuff how to add stuff how to make mobs attack you etc and how to have a sword even so stick around until the end of the video because this video is jampacked with facts so let's enter in our experience name so what you want to do is click here and then after that just enter in your name i will enter this tutorial like so and here you can select a grid to one by one two by two um and all of these grids however i am going to be doing one by one since it will not lag your computer as much if you do four by four it's quite big and i find that quite unnecessary one by one is big enough uh like my other game it was a one by one and i still had plenty of space to do what i wanted to do so one by one it lets you work with it without lag so let's click on one by one you can also select the theme um and there's multiple themes for you like it's going to be terrain kind of ish and there's going to be like whatever it says there's going to be a lake desert nether meadow antarctica jungle island etc but i will be doing it on empty since we can design our own things so once we do that we're going to click create and it will come into the loading page once we did that we will hop into a screen like this and what you want to do first is if you are experienced with games then you can move around with w a s d w is forwards s is backwards a is left and d is right okay so those are the controls to move around and you can zoom and zoom out um to basically get the fov you want you can also pan around like this doing a 360. with the um controls q and e q and e um q is to go turn pan right e is to pan left and the difference between holding a is a just lets you on like um to the side but cue actually wraps around like this um if you want to uh basically rotate around like a certain object like this one press alt and then click on the space you want the camera to rotate around so i want to rotate around this spawn point so alt click and there we go you can drag your mouse around while holding alt and it will be something like this which is pretty cool and that is basically the basic controls of course there is middle click too which helps you pan around like this basically wasd but just it's quicker um anyways there is more commands but i will not be showing you every single one since i already showed you the basics and what you should use so there we go that is the command and let's get to building so how to place a block you might wonder uh what you want to do is if if you ever played minecraft before this is kind of like minecraft click l or in minecraft you would click e but this one's l and now we can take a look at the stuff we have so we have blocks if you click on blocks there is going to be blocks for you to choose and how you can build with um i will be choosing a dirt brown okay a dirt brown okay once we chose our block we will just simply drag it into our inventory or hot bar so i drag into my first slot then after that i can have uh i'll have another one i'll have cobblestone with grass and i will have a asphalt lining like this one actually no i'll have a asphalt with clean white and black there so now once my hot bar is filled i press l again and then it will get me to this page um you can click on this arrow to hide in or out the hud and yeah so now once we have our hotbar slot filled with four blocks the way to place it is um not like minecraft minecraft uh if you hold left click then it will be breaking the blocks and if you press right click then it will be placing it but it's just opposite in here so you click left to place it click right on the block to delete it so let's place it down first so let's build like a house or something around this spawn point um so the way to zoom not zoom but to have a top down view is to hold alt and hold your not your scroll wheel sorry your left click and now we can build whatever we want like this okay like so and now we build uh one two three four five a five by five uh thing i think sorry house um around our spawn point and of course we can do much more but i'll just show you how to place and break blocks first so here we place all our blocks so it's now three blocks high okay and then you can place it into like this okay you can change your point of view to get an easier um easier way to not wait easier uh angle to put your blocks so now if we want to play our game what we want to do is we want to press tab and then it will basically switch from editor to play so if you hold tab it will go like this and now you spawn in here um in our little dirt hut that we made like so and you can actually be the player and you can run around and uh to punch something let me actually get an entity for this so the way to get an entity is you want to go into your library again and click on the entity right here entity library you can get any of them i guess um but i will get the beaver like so place a beaver down and once you did that what we want to do is we want to click on this thing right here um and once you click on the beaver you can actually assign this is to move by the way um if you click on this thing and you click on the beaver you can actually assign the behaviors that it has so right now it's on prey and what prey does is basically if there's a predator around when the predator is hungry it will chase the prey i will show you that example later but what you want to do is we want to just punch it first i guess um so we'll just have it as a as maybe uh maybe a melee enemy which will actually attack us back but if we turn all these down then it won't attack us anymore but anyways we will now be able to punch this thing so let's hold press tab again as you can see it comes comes after us immediately because it's a melee enemy um and this one you can use for your mobs uh the way to if it actually gets close it can bite you and you can notice that your health will actually go down from that so uh if you have a melee enemy stay away from them um anyways if you left click while you're a player you can hit them like that and you can see that i did nine damage to the beaver um hey she'll feel for a second shield so you can you can also hold sprint uh not hold sprint hold shift to sprint away like this and then uh you can run faster than the beaver you can press spacebar to jump and you can hold right click to block with your sword blocking with your sword will allow you to not take any damage like this and there is one very important fact that we should know is that if we uh block right as they attack then it will be a perfect parry and what it does is basically it will um stun them for a second and it will basically make them uh dazed and which will allow you to get some free hits without them attacking you so let me try oh i'm sorry he attacked me so what trick is to wait until it's red and there we go perfect parry and you can see these days and now you can get some free hits off them um it's if you think about it it's like a survival game it's pretty fun uh but yeah that is my explanation i'm of but anyways you can kill them and if you hold down left click you actually recharge your super power like this and it will do more damage to them and it will go through if they block if they block you can do this and it will go through their shield so yeah that is some basic controls there's another one which is if you hold if you press shift with left click you'll and forward i guess oh yeah you'll lunge attack so it's quite hard to do yeah there we go so um w shift left click will let you throw like a thrust attack i'm pretty sure that's what they call it thrust attack okay there we go see it thrusts itself forward so you have to be oh well that's roll there's some thrust it's really hard to get for some reason there you go so shift and then forward and left click at the same time so shift first forward left click yeah there we go shift forward left click shift forward left click there we go so that is how to rust attack and to roll is i'm pretty sure shift and um left click right oh okay um never mind it's not that but what we can do if we're not sure is we can click on options click on settings uh controls and now we can actually see the controls quick combo attack um and etc so actually let me go back there please okay there okay now we can see how to do stuff um so where is it heavy attack hold um hold uh the left click which is the super power first attack is w and left click perry is that dodge is just uh w right and show hide life is l okay so uh dodge is just w hello i'm pretty new oh oh oh i got it for some reason but i don't oh oh it's just shipped it's just shift okay to dodge is just shift and you will dodge and i'm pretty sure to dodge attack there is a dodge attack but i'm not sure what it is but you can dodge or roll with chip like this okay anyways let's get back to our editor so once we're in here i'm going to delete this little creature over here how you can delete something is you click on a block or something or anything basically and you right click on them oops never mind that's for blocks um how to delete an entity is to click over here click on the entity and delete there we go and that's how you delete an entity um now let's actually make a course so our character can fight uh enemy and actually ha uh win the game so i'm going to make a little pathway oh and let's do some parkour too cause you know it's quite cool okay so the way to delete a massive chunk is to just uh let let's pretend we have uh let's build something a lot right we don't need to keep on placing it like this i forgot you can actually hold down left click and you can drag to create a grid out of how big you want instead of just placing it one by one so now we have a really big grid and the way to delete it is to hold right uh and then just delete your thing so that applies for the ground too uh you can delete a massive patch then refill it like this um and you can delete this again or something but yeah you can not waste your time and you can delete a whole chunk at a time so now once we have a pretty long path i will actually make this a bit longer so that we have room for some parkour okay okay there we go so now once we parkour over there there will be an ending over here so we will let's create some parkour blocks shall we so let's have uh like this and then like this and then even higher three blocks and then one really really really really far away three blocks two and then let's just delete a little bit more and then like this and then this is where the boss fights happen and if we weren't if we run our code right now we can actually try it like this oops there you go and of course you can um sprint while you're jumping which will increase the jump length but i did it so that you don't need to sprint because sometimes people forget to sprint and they just fall off so yeah and now what we're gonna do is right now if you fall over here it basically does nothing um you can just start over again but what we want to do is we want if you fall into here on this part um then you will basically die and then you will come back to your checkpoint over here and then you will just do it again so let's make that first we have to elevate each one by one no actually we can just delete it but that's too much work so i will just elevate it by one like this um and it should still work there we go okay it still works um and we're gonna fill this part with lava or any block of your choice um so once we do that we will click l and i will search for lava there we go i'll get lava here and we will press l again and we'll just fill up this space right here with some lava um actually i'm pretty sure i can just yeah i'm pretty sure i can just do oh sorry i'm pretty sure i can just hold it and oh okay there we go and now the whole thing is filled with lava we can have little uh barriers on the side to make sure they can't escape like so um there we go a player is two blocks high by the way so once we did that let's try it out and of course the lava is not gonna kill us yet because we didn't program it too so if we were still in the lava it wouldn't do anything we can come back up here and then we can redo it but let's make sure that the lava actually kills us so how we do that is we can go into uh global parameters right here or global parameters go into controller on components uh so this is what the player will get hurt by and we can see over here damaging blocks so uh we want the lava to be the damaging blocks right so let's put some lava in here click on the lava by the way click here to edit it so once you do that press lava and block damage meaning how much damage should it do if we want all one hit meaning we have 100 health for a player we can set this to 100 which will insta kill once we did that it should kill us if we press tab again there we go it insta kills um oh and there you go that is the basics of of the parkour course okay i should make a little starting area maybe i should delete the house because you know it's kind of in the way so yeah let's uh delete the house so again deleting is pretty simple just you do this um i will delete this it's really easy to delete too because you know we can delete a whole chunk at a time there we go and now we have a starting area over here we can move the starting area by clicking on this thing and then we can click on the starting area and we can use these xy coordinates to move it or we can click on the plane right here to move it around but i will just use the xy coordinates since they are more accurate and once we did that we can just surround it back by uh these blocks so they can't escape there we go i why i was placing one by one but there so now we have our starting area like this and it's much better because there is nothing blocking you from jumping like this and you made it to the end so yeah that is the parkour course and let's add some enemies at the end so when they kill the enemies um we can win so let's add some space for the enemies let me use the white one now oh that's the black one oh my i accidentally deleted the white one um let me go search for it white asphalt there we go and we put it back into our hotbar slot okay now we can place it oh that's that's number four okay let's place it back okay there we go and now let's build a little wall here oh no i don't want to build with the same one okay oops okay like this and like this and now you can uh for the mob you can do any any mob you want uh and any entity sorry any entity you want so as long as it works so once we are done with this we will let's uh put in the entity so what entity shall we put in i was thinking of putting in the beaver but then i didn't really like killing it that time because it made me feel bad but let's try uh another entity uh maybe an evil one so i don't feel so bad about killing it okay um there's camels they're oh here here all right here are the evil ones there is detector defector block bot three um or defector bot i will get defector bot three since it looks way more evil oh so we put into our hot bar slot press l and we'll place it right in the center there we go that it looks like a chicken it looks like a chicken but um anyways this is our defector bot this i realized it was the back of it let me spin around hey there we go looks like a chicken um but anyways we oh oh i didn't mean to place it um we can control z like so and we can assign the behaviors by clicking on this then clicking on our entity and we can assign a physic uh do we want it to be collision collision means that when the player runs into it he can't just run through and i would recommend to put it on yes uh and then collision plus gravity i recommend no because if it is then it will just go flying so just collision and you can even name it i will name this chicken bot because it looks like a chicken and once we did that we can assign the behavior so right now it is assigned as melee enemy which means it will attack us and we can change the the how you call it the stats by ourselves right now it's on all maxed meaning it's the strongest um we can there's the health and we can add the component a component will basically let us uh win or lose so we can press on victory and we can do on death so when this dies it will become victory okay and now let's add it so that it can um block hits i am pretty sure it's somewhere around uh here i'm not sure though okay there press on edit logic and now you can have a bunch more uh a bunch more options so now we can do can block attack equals to true and now it will be able to block our attacks attack range we can make it this wide health is here uh and yeah there it is we can make it invincible too but anyways that is it so let it let us try of course this is not the finished product this is just a prototype and we can jump here jump there like so and then it realizes but since it's smart it doesn't come here because you know it's not high enough oh i didn't mean to i didn't know running forward would i mean pressing this uh oh no i didn't know pressing the left click would send me forward oh okay there you go so oh my gosh you know i just run on the wall okay for the sake of the video i will run on the wall of course you can make your wall higher um you can even make it invisible which what i will do but to make it not uh to make it cleaner but anyways let's resume uh like there is no gap okay so once we are here we can just hop in and we can start fighting like this but as you can see he's blocking every single hit a way to uh basically fix this problem is to every time he's going to hit you you block it perfectly oh sorry you blocked it perfectly so now you get a perfect parry which will daze him and you get some hits off him too like so and now you win like so um pretty simple pretty fun to do um it's very easy to code which i like i don't like like uh coding where it's like hard to do this coding is very simple you don't need any experience at all and you can do this um and yeah you can have fun with it all you want there's also another trick i want to show you is if you do your super attack it goes through his shield too so yeah that's pretty fun anyways you can make him a little bit more buff by uh making yourself more nerfed so let's go into the player settings which is in global parameters and go into a player controller and go into components but not components avatar sorry and we can go down here and we can look on sword and shield turn those into none so that now the players need to use their fist okay okay once we did that we can now close this up and we can do it again so now now players only have their fist to block and hit which will do less damage of course okay now you can block it while they're doing it so three two one there we go okay oh oh okay so we can oh sorry we can still use our magic power by the way even though we don't have any sword now oh no i'm really bad at parkour and there's also a little secret i want to show you at the end so stay tuned to find out about it there we go one hit and victory so now let's make the walls invisible first let's make it so that they are taller than the player so they can't jump out so oops okay let me zoom out a little bit okay there and now we will make it one more higher actually we should make it two more because one more wouldn't be enough okay place blocks okay there we go oh okay there we go i remember there was there but i just can't find it now but if i ever find it then i will tell you guys however right now i can't seem to find it so we're gonna have to stick with this wall first so let us play it again and now i'm pretty sure you can't jump out right yeah you can't jump out anymore even with the tallest one you can't jump because you're not two blocks high i mean you are more than two blocks high uh so now oh you can still jump out over here so let us edit that okay let me put this thing oh we had to change it back to free oh that was not the block this is okay okay there we go like oh no okay like this and there now you cannot jump out okay okay now you can just one shot this but i don't want to do that because it's not interesting so let's get a perfect parry and let's open okay three two one okay now we can just beat him up there we go and victory um there's also a thing where you can go into first person which is quite interesting so get a camera and get to first person and place on head equals to yes so now it will be first person and it will look much cooler when you're doing the parkour but you can't really see too much of yourself you can see sometimes your sword and your shadow but other than that you can't really see too much let me drink some water and when you're doing the parkour it looks really insane it looks really cool like you're in vr but when you're fighting it doesn't look too insane because you can't really see the health but anyways let's do some parkour so you can do like this oh okay okay okay okay there we go looks really cool but when you're fighting it looks kind of scary in real life oh okay ah no i fell so let's try to fight in oh no let's try to find first person so we can actually experience it no if i can actually complete the parkour okay if i don't make this i will just put the spawning point over here yeah okay i'm just gonna put the spawning point over there it's my you know what it's okay i'll just put it here because that's gonna screw up the point of the parkour oh okay there we go okay now i made it i made it and i'll just jump in here fight fight oh and you can block it but you ca you can tell when he attacks so you try to block it for perfect perry okay definitely not definitely not perfect perry perfect parry oh it was yeah i got it so that is um the how do you call it that is first person we can actually add more stuff so we can click on rules over here and we can do welcoming players um camera welcome and then we can just uh do whatever we want i will do this world center no actually i'll do avatar so now we will basically be able to call ourself the level name is going to be chicken chicken parkour like so oh parkhuro parkour and we will have our description which is complete the parkour uh core and kill the evil chicken robot chicken robot like this and we can actually assign some music to it but i'm not going to be doing that today you can do that but uh i will not um it you can feel free to do that but i am not going to do that for today so if we were to pray not play right now you can see that it like rotates around our player and it has their description complete the parkour and kill the evil chicken robot and the starting an adventure in chicken parkour so if we were to click we will come into this land right here and okay there we go no okay and we can just complete it again if i can do that but yeah that is the basics of game editor of course i still don't know a lot so if i get some facts wrong then um it's my first time so don't judge me too hard oh i just realized he's wearing a bandana but anyways that is it for today's video i hope you enjoyed um and yeah let's beat this guy for the last time um like so okay oop perfect carry there we go um and yeah that is our uh parkour um and how to add some mobs in i hope you like it and see you in the next video bye
