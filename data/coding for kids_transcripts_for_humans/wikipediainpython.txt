00:35 - there's one more thing we need to tell
00:36 - you to subscribe
00:38 - like and share thank you
00:42 - bye bye saudi crap hello my name is
00:45 - jeremy and today i'm going to be
00:47 - teaching you how to make a wikipedia
00:49 - program in python
00:50 - first of all you would need to um insert
00:54 - the document from microsoft which is a
00:57 - plug-in
00:58 - and what it does is it can like um do
01:01 - stuff in microsoft
01:02 - word which is the on the docs and
01:05 - oh yeah first of all i want to mention
01:07 - that i'm in idl
01:08 - e python right now so yeah open that up
01:12 - in your computer and yeah so
01:15 - after we imported the document let's
01:17 - import wikipedia because we're also
01:19 - going to pull information from the
01:20 - wikipedia and paste inside the document
01:23 - so after we did that let's define what
01:25 - wikipedia
01:26 - wiki is wiki um there's a key word comma
01:30 - lang equals
01:30 - english so the lang is a variable and en
01:34 - is um english
01:37 - like the quote for english so wikipedia
01:40 - dot set playing
01:41 - um language to learn so if you want to
01:44 - change the language you could just
01:45 - change it up here
01:46 - uh yeah moving on to data data is
01:50 - wikipedia.summary which is another code
01:52 - for the plugin of wikipedia and then
01:54 - data2's we computed that page to get the
01:56 - whole page
01:58 - and data um this is also data2 it's
02:01 - that data2.content so i think it's going
02:04 - to print it or something
02:06 - and then doc um equal to document so
02:09 - this is to create the document
02:11 - so it will automatically generate a new
02:13 - microsoft for us
02:14 - it will like make it and then doc dot
02:17 - add heading
02:18 - so now this is kind of like crazy
02:21 - because you can actually edit the whole
02:22 - entire document
02:24 - um in python so add a heading with the
02:27 - keyword
02:27 - um means like so you type like spacing
02:30 - right
02:31 - and then it comes um in the heading
02:34 - equals to space
02:35 - so yeah it's gonna be pretty cool and
02:37 - then doc dot add paragraph
02:39 - which is data2 so as you can see it's
02:41 - getting the whole page and it's going to
02:43 - put
02:43 - it in the paragraph the doc save which
02:46 - is to
02:47 - control s the name is going to be the
02:49 - keyword plus
02:50 - dot dot x which is the um the last name
02:53 - of documents
02:55 - so um like the keyword is space based
02:57 - dot x yeah
02:59 - um that's how to what that's where key
03:02 - is and we print successfully created so
03:04 - they would know that
03:05 - it's done now moving on is that
03:08 - um wikipedia.lang
03:11 - en this one is to also set the language
03:14 - and
03:14 - from tk inter import and this one's to
03:17 - import the ttk
03:19 - and this one's to import the message box
03:21 - which is like the text box
03:22 - where we could like enter and type stuff
03:25 - in
03:26 - so yeah and gui equals tk
03:30 - gi dot title wikipedia this is to make
03:32 - our um
03:33 - main menu that pops up and ui.geometry
03:37 - is to um resize our main menu to how
03:40 - much we want so right now it's currently
03:42 - 400 times
03:43 - 300 yeah so it's how big it is
03:46 - and in the font number one it goes send
03:48 - a new
03:49 - um 15 so this is the font and this is
03:51 - the size of the font
03:53 - yeah moving on to setting the l variable
03:56 - is to make um the name
04:00 - of the i mean the text inside the
04:03 - message box and it's going to be like
04:05 - enter your topic here
04:07 - so you would be uh
04:10 - um like a little text to show you where
04:12 - you enter your topic
04:14 - and then l.pack and then after that
04:16 - we're going to do
04:17 - uh on that what the important code right
04:20 - here is to e dot pack paddy equal 10
04:23 - okay uh remember that also
04:26 - um this is for the message boxer to type
04:30 - it in
04:30 - right when um like that little
04:34 - this thing message box right here we're
04:36 - going to resize it and we're going to
04:37 - set how big um
04:39 - pretty sure this is how big it is like
04:41 - the width
04:42 - and font equals to font one which is
04:44 - essaying a new as i told you
04:46 - so when they type it that's going to be
04:47 - how big and what font it is
04:49 - moving on is um defined search so what
04:52 - is search
04:53 - the keyword equals v underscore search
04:56 - dot get
04:56 - this is to grab the information from the
04:58 - text box and search it up in wikipedia
05:00 - so as you can see language sorry
05:04 - sorry um so wiki keyword language
05:07 - so they're gonna search it up on
05:08 - wikipedia um
05:10 - after that we're going to show info
05:13 - successfully recorded
05:14 - which means that they're going to um
05:16 - tell the
05:17 - person who's using this program that
05:19 - they have successfully
05:20 - got the information from wikipedia and
05:23 - for um except right here
05:25 - in case like they just type something
05:26 - random in or something that doesn't make
05:28 - sense
05:29 - then the program is going to tell them
05:31 - that uh keyword or
05:32 - please enter your search again so like
05:35 - they would have to be more specific
05:37 - or they just have to like find a
05:38 - different topic
05:40 - now this is almost done b1 you go to ttk
05:43 - button
05:44 - and um text goes to search so this is
05:46 - like the button
05:47 - that you click when you want to search
05:49 - and in there it's going to have a text
05:51 - which
05:52 - is searched so they would know what this
05:53 - button does okay
05:55 - so now here is to create um a check mark
05:59 - for what language you want to set it
06:00 - this is getting a little fancy because
06:02 - um if you can select the language uh you
06:05 - can like do many other things with it
06:07 - and instead of making it a column
06:08 - straight down we're going to make it
06:10 - horizontal
06:11 - uh so how we do it is over here row goes
06:13 - to zero column goes to
06:15 - zero and then continue column equal one
06:17 - column go to two
06:18 - after that put the gui main loop in and
06:20 - then we're good
06:22 - and yeah let's try running this program
06:24 - it's pretty fun
06:26 - so here we are in our shell and what do
06:29 - we want to search up
06:30 - uh let me take it to english what do we
06:33 - want
06:34 - to search up um
06:37 - code how about no no how about
06:41 - okay let's search it up and
06:44 - [Music]
06:45 - please enter your search again so they
06:47 - couldn't find our thing
06:49 - how let's just do uh
06:52 - cats maybe okay search
06:57 - and yeah there we go successfully
06:59 - created
07:00 - so now we should have it in where we
07:03 - saved our
07:04 - idle so go to where you save your ido
07:08 - okay and here it is cat
07:12 - open it up as you can see the heading is
07:15 - cats
07:16 - and the cat the felis caddis um is like
07:19 - a domestic species of small carnivorous
07:21 - mammal and as you can see
07:23 - it's like our the whole thing got in um
07:26 - which is really cool actually uh this is
07:29 - really really easy for school projects
07:32 - and i think it should be really useful
07:34 - how about let's try
07:35 - typing something random in like
07:37 - something that the program won't know
07:39 - what we
07:39 - meant um come over here
07:42 - search it up okay just blue right in
07:46 - and switch it up please enter your
07:48 - search again there we go
07:50 - how about we're going to do chinese now
07:53 - cats
07:54 - or they need to be typed into these i'm
07:56 - not sure
07:58 - yeah it needs to be typed in chinese too
08:00 - in order to get chinese
08:01 - so yeah english it works and
08:04 - um yeah that's it for this one
08:08 - and see you next video bye
