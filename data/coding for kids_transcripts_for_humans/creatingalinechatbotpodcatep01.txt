12:54 - copy the channel id first which is in
12:56 - basic settings
12:58 - go back to dialog box and paste it in
13:01 - after that we will need the channel

and then it will just say working and then it's going to be a little um slow or like long time but it's okay it should come pretty soon uh last time we did this i waited for around two or two hours i can't wait two hours hey you can't why not um hi you got sticked bugged why are we still here just to suffer um well okay continue yeah probably um and uh we go to education we go after that once we created it let's make sure that our agent is podcat okay once we did that we'll go to inter integrations and then we will scroll down to line click online and then you have some forms to fill out but don't worry oh it's secret what we do is we go to line developers this um this one line developer our link and then what we do is we just copy the channel id first which is in basic settings go back to dialog box and paste it in after that we will need the channel secret which is a little bit lower and here um that's our secret and click copy and click copy what do you expect um like and paste it and channel access token what you do is we go over to messaging api scroll down a bit and um channel access token right here click issue and then it should give us a very long link click copy go back to dialog flow and paste it in after that click start and there should be a link that appears in here we will copy that and we'll go back into our line developer and we will click on um webhook settings web code url click edit and paste and update like so and after this uh we can just do we know we don't take that um and after this we can check if our bot actually is here by using this link in line so i will be recording my ipad screen in there so um yeah let's do it click copy and i'll just send it to my mail or in telegram and then i'll just open it into my ipad all right let's do a
