00:00 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:01 - today i will be giving a brief overview
00:04 - on the sandbox there are two
00:05 - technologies that are going to change
00:07 - the world there is the ai which i did a
00:09 - project on in the past and there is the
00:12 - blockchain now
00:14 - the blockchain i never did a project on
00:16 - and i don't really understand yet and i
00:19 - love coding games so i thought why not
00:22 - learn about blockchains and code at the
00:24 - same time or not even code just play the
00:26 - game and that's where the sandbox comes
00:29 - in the sandbox is a game that uses the
00:31 - blockchain technology as their main
00:33 - function so i thought why not play it
00:35 - and i will be giving you a brief
00:36 - overview on the sandbox right now
00:39 - so first off what is the sandbox the
00:42 - sandbox is a virtual world where
00:44 - creators and people all around the world
00:46 - can share ideas and make 3d models using
00:49 - voxels they can also monetize their
00:51 - artwork into the marketplace and from
00:54 - then programmers or people who don't
00:57 - even have experience and want to code a
00:59 - game in 3d can use those assets for
01:01 - their game and then they can publish
01:03 - their game to the marketplace
01:05 - okay now once we know what sandbox is
01:07 - let's look at a further detail
01:10 - so here is a map of the sandbox now this
01:14 - is what it looks like it might look a
01:15 - little complicated but i will explain it
01:17 - to you so let's look at this top row
01:19 - first there are the main tokens which is
01:21 - there is the sand which is the currency
01:24 - there is land which is kind of like in
01:25 - real life there you can buy sell uh or
01:28 - rent land there is some assets which is
01:31 - basically 3d models of things there's
01:34 - gems and catalyst and i'll explain about
01:36 - those later and there is the main
01:38 - products these products are going to
01:41 - basically let us create stuff sell stuff
01:44 - and uh make some games so there is the
01:47 - box edit and the vox edit is used to
01:49 - create 3d models the marketplace is used
01:52 - to sell buy
01:54 - and do it basically trading everything
01:56 - in the marketplace and there is the game
01:58 - maker the game maker doesn't require any
02:01 - coding experience you can just uh code a
02:04 - 3d game using this uh
02:07 - product and there is the game client
02:09 - which is the players that just play the
02:10 - game so this is these are the main
02:13 - products of the sandbox now let's look
02:16 - at what we can do as normal players so
02:18 - there is of course the centralized part
02:20 - which is the sandbox team they are
02:22 - basically the headquarters and there is
02:25 - the decentralized part which is what we
02:26 - can do we can be a sand owner which
02:29 - means we own the currency um and we can
02:31 - be a land owner which means we can own a
02:34 - part of the land in the metaverse and
02:36 - these two are part of the governance and
02:38 - if we want to do anything else like
02:41 - being an artist we can do that we can be
02:43 - a game designer and a player
02:45 - so now let's take a look at our game
02:48 - maker so as a game maker we can do a lot
02:52 - of things basically we can buy and sell
02:54 - nfts not buy and sell sorry buy and use
02:57 - nfts from the marketplace and for our
03:00 - game
03:01 - once we did that we can
03:03 - publish our games to the
03:06 - to other people to play um such as the
03:09 - game clients they can pay to play our
03:11 - game and we will get the money from that
03:13 - also the tsb foundation which is the
03:15 - treasury of the
03:17 - sandbox will pay us to make a mini game
03:20 - and we can also rent and buy land to
03:23 - publish our game to the metaverse so the
03:26 - how the land works is that inside of the
03:28 - metaverse there is
03:30 - 166 thousand
03:32 - uh 646
03:34 - land and you can buy one of those lands
03:36 - or rent them and you can publish your
03:38 - games to there and people can actually
03:41 - play it
03:42 - okay once we know what the game maker
03:44 - does let's look at how they get their
03:46 - attributes so like nft for example when
03:49 - they use it for
03:50 - you know uh their games how do they get
03:53 - that well they get supplied by the vox
03:55 - editors the vox editors are 3d artists
03:58 - that uh just create nfts or 3d models
04:02 - and they can create some animations with
04:04 - it too and they will create it and they
04:06 - will sell it to the marketplace once
04:08 - somebody buys it they'll get 95 of the
04:11 - profit and the rest five percent will go
04:13 - to the tsb foundation which is a
04:15 - treasury and then the treasury will then
04:18 - pay the vox editors for the work that
04:20 - they have done
04:22 - okay now let's look at the game client
04:25 - so the game client is basically the
04:27 - players who just play the game i guess
04:30 - and once they play the game they
04:32 - actually need to pay to play the game
04:34 - makers game that they created and once
04:36 - they did that uh they can actually earn
04:38 - money by doing so the tsp foundation
04:41 - will give them
04:42 - uh more money if they play more however
04:45 - the concept behind this is not uh so
04:48 - open yet there will be more information
04:50 - coming in the future but currently it is
04:53 - the concept that the more you play the
04:54 - more you earn once they did that they
04:56 - can also buy and sell nfts just like the
04:59 - box editor but instead of creating it
05:01 - they can buy and sell it again
05:03 - and yeah that is the game client
05:05 - and let's now take a look at the
05:08 - these two right here these two icons are
05:10 - if we look back to the beginning they
05:12 - are the sand owner and the landowner
05:15 - so the game makers can be a land owner
05:17 - and a
05:19 - sand owner too as you can see there is
05:21 - interaction between these two but
05:23 - basically what these two can do is they
05:25 - can staking to upgrade their nfts so
05:27 - they can have avatars and customization
05:29 - and equipment and gems so now let's take
05:33 - a look at what gems does we probably
05:35 - know what avatars and customization is
05:37 - right so we just customize our avatar to
05:39 - make it look cool have special powers
05:42 - and the special powers is where the gems
05:44 - come in so the gems is basically some
05:47 - power ups we can have there are five
05:49 - gems this is the power gem the defense
05:51 - gem the gem sorry the speed gem the
05:54 - magic gem and the luck gem
05:57 - and you drink some water
06:02 - and you can put the max four gems into
06:06 - an attribute
06:07 - so
06:08 - uh basically
06:09 - if you have a tier one catalyst now a
06:12 - catalyst is the amount of gems you can
06:14 - put into your uh character so if you
06:17 - have a tier one catalyst you can only
06:19 - put one gem if you have a tier two
06:21 - catalyst you can put in two gems tier
06:24 - three three gems four gems um and you
06:27 - have max until four so you can have five
06:30 - gems you can only have four and in those
06:32 - four gems you can put any gems inside
06:33 - there it doesn't matter if they're
06:35 - repeating or not so you can have your
06:36 - character super fast super strong super
06:39 - defense or maybe just uh super strong
06:42 - super defense a super speed and
06:45 - luck or you can full luck i don't know
06:48 - and yeah that is what the gems and
06:49 - catalyst does
06:51 - okay now let's look at the
06:54 - uh where is it uh here we can see now
06:57 - the tsp foundation there it can uh it
07:00 - pays a lot of people actually it pays
07:03 - the game maker
07:05 - it pays the
07:06 - of these people which i will be
07:08 - explaining later it pays the players to
07:11 - play the game and it pays the creators
07:14 - of the 3d voxels which is the box
07:16 - editors
07:18 - and now let's take a look at this so
07:19 - what do they pay so basically when you
07:22 - own a piece of land the more money you
07:24 - put onto your land uh the basically the
07:28 - more
07:28 - money you will get it's kind of like
07:30 - with the bank if you put a lot of money
07:32 - cash inside of the bank then when the
07:36 - when you get you try to
07:38 - get it back or like
07:40 - receive the money you'll get more in
07:41 - return so this is kind of like what it
07:43 - does if you put more money into your
07:45 - land you will get more money back so
07:47 - it's profit basically
07:49 - and yeah that is most of
07:51 - the sandbox i hope you found this useful
07:54 - if you do please leave like and thank
07:56 - you very much for watching see you next
07:57 - one bye

hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be giving a brief overview on the sandbox there are two technologies that are going to change the world there is the ai which i did a project on in
