01:14 - hello my name is jimmy and today i'm
01:17 - going to be showing you how to
01:18 - communicate
01:19 - between python and line so first of all
01:22 - you would need to
01:23 - import requests import requests is
01:26 - um to how to communicate
01:30 - from the data from the internet and
01:33 - uh now for these from tdk import
01:37 - and from tk inter import ttk
01:41 - um this is the standard you need to in
01:44 - order to create that pop-up thing
01:46 - and these three you can just copy it
01:49 - down
01:50 - this is for the this is line
01:53 - configuration
01:54 - and you might be wondering like what is
01:57 - token
01:58 - why did you do like this well in order
02:01 - to make this work really you have to go
02:04 - to this website right here this website
02:08 - notify and then dash bot dot line
02:11 - dot me slash en slash so yeah
02:15 - this is the website you need to go in
02:17 - it's the line website
02:18 - and log into here and then put in your
02:21 - email and password
02:23 - then scroll down and should um find uh
02:26 - generate token then do that then click
02:29 - copy
02:30 - after that you can finally paste in your
02:34 - um token in here in here and then
02:38 - after that uh you got all this
02:41 - information down this one you can just
02:42 - copy from me except for token
02:45 - and finally after that you go to
02:49 - um write down gui equal to tk
02:53 - we're starting to make our main window
02:55 - now so gi geometry
02:57 - uh 500 times 300 i think you should know
03:00 - what that is to create
03:01 - how um big the windows pop-up screen
03:05 - supposed to be
03:06 - and gui.title to name the window screen
03:09 - you could name it like
03:11 - uh line or something
03:16 - and then now um define line two
03:19 - which is to message from
03:23 - uh how you call it from your python
03:26 - to line this is the code right here um
03:30 - message equal to v message underscore
03:32 - dot get
03:33 - print sending now plus message so
03:37 - this is like to notify you that they're
03:40 - sending it
03:41 - and message equals to yeah you could
03:45 - forgery yourself as like what
03:48 - um steve jobs
03:52 - and then do this and then plus message
03:54 - so you could disguise yourself with
03:55 - anybody
03:56 - and just do it okay r equals to request
04:00 - that post
04:01 - yeah all this stuff and that's the
04:04 - defining line two which is going to be
04:07 - useful
04:08 - later on so the underscore message you
04:11 - go to string bar
04:12 - e1 ttk dot entry gui text variable yeah
04:17 - basically all that stuff to put make the
04:20 - um the column
04:23 - of the high call the the input and then
04:28 - for the button

04:32 - here this is to name the button
04:34 - you can name it whatever you want i'm
04:35 - gonna name it send actually
04:39 - and the command you go to line two which
04:41 - is over here
04:42 - so we're going to be using that once
04:43 - they click the button it's going to have
04:45 - line two
04:46 - okay perfect and ipad x
04:49 - equal to 20 and ipad y equals 20
04:53 - is how big the um button is supposed to
04:56 - be
04:56 - so yeah ui main loop is to keep on
05:00 - repeating the program
05:01 - so you won't have to click run over and
