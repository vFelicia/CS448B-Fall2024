00:00 - hello everybody my name is jimmy and
00:02 - today i will be giving you a brief
00:04 - overview of control flow and logical
00:07 - operators this is ep3 of my well-known
00:10 - series um that is called
00:13 - teaching myself python so i don't forget
00:15 - python in the future
00:17 - um
00:18 - i don't even know the name of the series
00:19 - but anyways we're going to be continuing
00:21 - on that and today we're going to be
00:23 - learning about control flow and logical
00:25 - operators as i said earlier and we're
00:27 - also going to be making
00:29 - choose you choose your own story kind of
00:31 - game um like where like those books
00:34 - where you have to choose like what uh
00:37 - options you want and then you flip to a
00:38 - different page if you choose like this
00:41 - option then you go to this page this
00:42 - option go to this page and then the book
00:45 - will vary or the ending will vary
00:46 - depending on what you choose so if you
00:48 - chose something good then it would the
00:51 - ending would be good or it could just be
00:53 - like you choose something good then
00:54 - anything would be bad but anyways we're
00:56 - going to be making that sort of um game
00:58 - today and it's going to be very fun um
01:01 - it's going to be mostly writing not
01:03 - coding and sometimes it will get a
01:05 - little complicated so you have to stick
01:07 - with me
01:08 - you can see right here there is a lot of
01:11 - text on screen and but it's all about
01:14 - that you know it's kind of like a story
01:16 - so what uh we're gonna be making this
01:18 - and we're gonna just test what it looks
01:20 - like first right so you can see here
01:22 - this is like a art of somebody playing
01:25 - soccer and this is the person keep goal
01:27 - keeping the goal and again i do not know
01:30 - why this press to enter press enter to
01:32 - start thing is up here even though i
01:35 - clearly put it down here if you have a
01:37 - solution please tell me but i really
01:39 - don't know why this is happening uh and
01:41 - sometimes it doesn't happen you know if
01:42 - i re restart the kernel
01:45 - and try it again
01:46 - yeah see it doesn't happen anymore i
01:48 - really don't know why but anyways it's
01:50 - just wacky and yeah let's get into the
01:52 - story
01:53 - so by this amazing art right here we can
01:56 - tell that we are in the 2024 fifa world
01:59 - cup championships or i don't know and we
02:02 - are in the
02:03 - fight finales or finals and the score is
02:06 - tied two to two there is only 34 seconds
02:10 - left in the game and the the story says
02:12 - to make the correct decisions to win the
02:14 - game by the way i wrote the entire story
02:16 - so if it's bad my fault
02:18 - actually not my fault because it's gonna
02:19 - be good
02:20 - so when you press enter to start they
02:22 - said the ball is coming towards you
02:24 - however there is a player defending you
02:26 - what do you do you either pick get the
02:29 - ball or wait i'm gonna say
02:32 - well i know that i know the
02:33 - like the ending of course but i'm gonna
02:36 - pretend like i don't you know and i'll
02:37 - say let's get the ball
02:40 - and it says you decide to get the ball
02:41 - you run and then leap into the air
02:43 - unfortunately your shoe is untied and
02:44 - you spin your ankle retry and that is a
02:46 - great way to go out in a fifa
02:49 - 2024 world cup
02:51 - definitely and when let's pick weight
02:53 - this time so you decide to wait the ball
02:55 - bounces off the ground harder than the
02:57 - defender anticipated you manage to
02:59 - intercept the ball smoothly and continue
03:01 - what do you do pick pass or dribble
03:04 - uh let's say we're gonna dribble the
03:06 - ball no actually dribbling sounds a bad
03:09 - idea let's try passing the ball you
03:11 - decide to pass the ball you look around
03:13 - searching for your teammate you spot a
03:14 - teammate that is close by you kick the
03:16 - ball with bullet position out of nowhere
03:18 - a defender comes flying into the air but
03:20 - they miss narrowly the ball lands safely
03:22 - to your teammate and he sprints up field
03:24 - near the penalty area he passes it back
03:26 - to you what do you do then there's four
03:28 - seconds left in the game no pressure at
03:30 - all you either shoot or dribble so keep
03:32 - in mind i didn't write this but there's
03:34 - two defenders and a goalkeeper so in
03:36 - total there's three people blocking you
03:37 - from scoring uh but you know let's we're
03:39 - gonna
03:40 - that's like the point so we're gonna
03:42 - let's just dribble you know
03:43 - okay you decide to dribble you dribble
03:45 - towards the goal and the clock is
03:46 - ticking down you do both defenders okay
03:49 - and now you prepare to shoot so it's
03:51 - just you the goalkeeper your foot makes
03:53 - contact with the ball and the only thing
03:54 - stopping you is the goalkeeper he leaps
03:56 - into the air and manages to catch the
03:58 - ball retry
04:00 - you failed because you suck
04:02 - let's try again get the ball so let's
04:04 - wait and then let's pass and then right
04:07 - now let's try to shoot you decide to
04:09 - shoot you get into position for a
04:11 - cannonball of a shot wow your foot makes
04:14 - contact with the ball causing it to go
04:15 - airborne the ball is out of reach from
04:17 - the defenders okay one-on-one now and
04:19 - now it's all up to the goalkeeper at the
04:21 - last second the ball curves severely
04:23 - catching the keeper off guard okay he
04:25 - makes a last-ditch effort to stop it but
04:27 - it wasn't good enough you won
04:29 - exclamation point exclamation point
04:30 - exclamation point
04:32 - you know that's my story it's um
04:34 - it only has a few
04:36 - like options but you want to continue it
04:38 - you can i was just you know i don't want
04:41 - to write anymore because this is a lot
04:42 - of writing uh it's like six paragraphs
04:44 - or something but yeah that's basically
04:47 - what we're gonna be making today i'm not
04:48 - gonna be rewriting this i'm gonna be
04:50 - using the old text but i'm gonna make it
04:52 - live with you so yeah let's go start up
04:55 - a new notebook really quick let me save
04:57 - this
05:01 - all right everybody i have loaded into a
05:02 - new jupyter notebook and by the way if
05:04 - you don't have jupiter it's going to be
05:05 - in the description you can go uh watch
05:07 - the video that i made on how to get to
05:09 - the notebook it's really easy but
05:11 - anyways once you have done that and open
05:13 - jupiter notebook just type in uh just
05:16 - get open your python 3 ipy kernel and
05:19 - rename it to something you can remember
05:21 - so let's rename this to
05:23 - uh
05:25 - story just choose your own story or
05:28 - something
05:28 - choose
05:30 - your
05:31 - own story like so
05:35 - or you could name whatever you want to
05:37 - make the story about if you have no idea
05:39 - yet then you don't have to name anything
05:41 - um but anyways just
05:43 - choose your own story and then what
05:45 - we're gonna do is we're gonna go into
05:48 - uh we're gonna search up ascii art like
05:50 - so just search it up and just click on
05:53 - the first one that appears
05:54 - uh you can see there's a bunch of things
05:56 - for us to choose from animals are design
05:58 - books building and places cartoons
06:00 - clothing accessories comics
06:02 - all this sort of stuff and you can
06:03 - choose whatever you want and once you
06:06 - have it just click into it i'm gonna do
06:08 - sports and outdoors since that's what i
06:10 - did earlier and this is very messed up
06:13 - the gui is not very good let me reload
06:15 - this
06:16 - okay it's still not fixed but that is
06:18 - fine because we're going to be choosing
06:20 - soccer the greatest sport of all time
06:22 - and if you're if you argue with that
06:24 - you're wrong but anyways this is the
06:26 - ascii art for soccer um you can choose
06:29 - any ascii art and then put it into the
06:31 - little jupiter notebook thingy i might
06:34 - choose a different one this time i'm
06:35 - gonna choose like
06:37 - maybe maybe the soccer ball it's not bad
06:39 - soccer ball okay let me pick this one
06:43 - all right and then once you have it
06:44 - selected just press ctrl c and then go
06:47 - back to your um jupiter notebook and
06:50 - then from there let's do print
06:53 - and instead of a normal uh single quote
06:56 - or double quote we're actually going to
06:57 - be putting
06:58 - three single quotes like so and then
07:00 - press enter to twice and then after that
07:03 - control v right into the middle this way
07:05 - it prints the entire thing and not just
07:07 - jumbled up into a mess
07:09 - uh incomplete
07:11 - input
07:12 - incomplete input what are you talking
07:14 - about
07:16 - it has
07:18 - some uh double quotes not double quotes
07:20 - single quotes in this uh it's okay i'll
07:22 - just replace it
07:25 - there you go there you go looks good as
07:27 - new and search for more single quotes it
07:29 - doesn't look like there is so let's try
07:31 - it out
07:32 - oh no that's a little messed up but you
07:34 - can see that this line right here is
07:36 - messed up the line right before s and t
07:38 - and that is a very easy fix so just
07:40 - press enter
07:42 - right here cut this line where it's
07:44 - messed up off and try running again all
07:46 - right if it doesn't work then you press
07:47 - the wrong line so we're gonna go
07:50 - uh with
07:51 - this one then
07:53 - okay and now let's try running again uh
07:55 - it's nearly fixed we just need a little
07:58 - bit more so up here too
08:01 - there you go it's fixed so that's how to
08:03 - fix it
08:04 - actually in my fifa story i had to cut
08:06 - off this middle lane right here because
08:08 - of that too so yeah that is how to fix
08:11 - your ascii art if it ever gets broken
08:13 - just enter in the lines that are broken
08:15 - and you should have it working
08:17 - all right but now it doesn't really look
08:19 - that clean right so i want a little
08:21 - border that will separate it from my
08:24 - text so
08:25 - i'm going to just copy this thing you
08:27 - can have anything you could just have
08:28 - underscores if you want underscores
08:30 - might look better actually or just
08:31 - dashes
08:32 - i could just do dashes too
08:34 - like so and then copy this
08:37 - and then put at the top too and then
08:40 - uh press run and there you go that looks
08:42 - pretty good if it's too wide then just
08:44 - delete a little bit
08:46 - okay
08:47 - one two three four all right
08:50 - and run it again there you go looks
08:51 - pretty good and now from then we're
08:53 - going to print a little welcome message
08:55 - so we're going to have it in the normal
08:57 - uh quotation marks if you want on one
08:59 - line but i wanted i wanted to have a
09:01 - little longer x longer um introduction
09:05 - so i'm going to have the three little
09:07 - single quotes again and then my
09:09 - introduction will be
09:11 - uh this one right here you can make your
09:13 - own introduction just uh tell them the
09:15 - settings where they are and like
09:18 - make the correct decisions to win the
09:19 - game or something and by the way if you
09:21 - want this notebook it's in the
09:22 - description so you could use my story
09:24 - too um there's no copyright so you're
09:27 - not plagiarizing but anyways this is my
09:29 - introduction and let's try running this
09:31 - uh there you go welcome to the fifa
09:33 - world cup and if it's like a little too
09:35 - far indented here we could just delete
09:38 - this one and then it should be less
09:40 - indented there you go and welcome to the
09:43 - fifa world club blah blah okay once our
09:45 - introduction is done let me put a little
09:48 - comment saying introduction intro okay
09:51 - and now we're gonna
09:53 - ask them to start so we're gonna ask
09:56 - them start question mark and this is the
09:59 - part where i keep on getting an error
10:02 - well not an error but it's just wacky
10:04 - it's where this thing the input goes up
10:06 - below or above the text sometimes so
10:09 - yeah use this if you want but you don't
10:12 - have to either so press enter to start
10:15 - let's try it again you can see it goes
10:16 - up but now let's try restarting the
10:18 - kernel
10:20 - okay let's try again and you see it goes
10:22 - back down
10:22 - it's very weird i don't know i don't
10:24 - know why but
10:26 - uh that is uh or press enter to start so
10:28 - once you press enter it doesn't do
10:30 - anything because we haven't told to do
10:32 - anything
10:33 - but after we gave them a little
10:36 - starting thingy we're going to ask them
10:38 - the first question
10:40 - on what they're going to do so you can
10:42 - see right here
10:44 - d1 so we're going to make a variable
10:46 - first let's make
10:47 - actually i'm a
10:49 - question one all right
10:51 - so we're going to set a variable called
10:53 - d1 this is for decision one d1 equals
10:56 - two and then your question i'm going to
10:58 - put this in three single quotes again
11:01 - just so that i can go on multiple lines
11:03 - so that so that way it looks better
11:05 - instead of just one long text it's just
11:08 - more you know more
11:10 - uh gradual so the reader actually wants
11:12 - to read it and it looks longer so it
11:14 - looks nicer
11:15 - and then after that grab your
11:18 - introduction thingy and let me tell you
11:21 - the basics of this so the basics of all
11:24 - this is just
11:26 - tell them uh what their what what where
11:29 - they are and what is the problem so like
11:32 - you tell them the ball is coming towards
11:34 - you but there is a problem the there's
11:36 - somebody defending you what do you do
11:38 - you either pick get the ball or wait
11:40 - this is very vital down here pick the
11:42 - ball or white um
11:44 - if you don't give them an option they're
11:46 - just going to print whatever so you have
11:47 - to give them either option and then
11:49 - after that put dot lower with two
11:52 - parentheses at the end right here to
11:54 - make sure that whatever they type in
11:55 - it's always going to be lowercase that
11:57 - way we can use our if else statements
11:59 - pretty easily without any errors so once
12:02 - we have done this we're just going to
12:03 - set up our first if statement so if
12:06 - d1 equal equal to whatever is the
12:09 - correct option so if get the ball was
12:12 - the correct option you would put get the
12:14 - ball in here but in my case weight is
12:16 - the correct option so equals to weight
12:17 - make sure everything is lower case by
12:19 - the way that is very very important and
12:22 - once you have done that we're just going
12:24 - to put a colon at the end and then from
12:26 - there we're going to print um
12:28 - our like congratulations to them or
12:30 - something so whatever
12:32 - uh story the what
12:35 - sorry
12:36 - whatever story you have next put that in
12:37 - here so uh
12:39 - do input
12:41 - input or not sorry d2
12:44 - uh equals to
12:46 - [Music]
12:47 - input
12:49 - input and hey stop input
12:52 - and there's story down here my story
12:55 - will
12:56 - be in triple quotes again you could use
12:58 - single quote or
13:00 - quotation marks if you want but i'm
13:02 - going to make it a little bit longer and
13:03 - then after you have that don't write
13:05 - anything yet by the way
13:06 - you're gonna have an else statement so
13:09 - else
13:10 - uh
13:11 - you if they say like get the ball or
13:12 - something we'll say the
13:15 - print
13:17 - something that is saying that they
13:19 - didn't make it or some a story that
13:22 - plays out so in my case i say like they
13:25 - sprained their ankle or something but
13:27 - you can it's up to you and so let's uh
13:30 - now write the one that is correct so d2
13:34 - input and then just start writing in my
13:37 - case i'm copying pasting
13:39 - but yeah that is uh
13:42 - that is it and then i need my uh pick or
13:46 - password dribble
13:47 - my my recommendation for you is to just
13:50 - copy d1
13:51 - and just paste it in d2 like that but
13:54 - make sure the indenting is correct and
13:56 - by the way the text indentation is very
13:59 - uh weird so you might need to play
14:01 - around with that it can be anywhere if
14:03 - it's especially if it's towards this
14:05 - corner it will look better if it's
14:07 - outside then like if you indented it
14:09 - twice then when it prints out it's also
14:11 - indented twice so i recommend just
14:13 - sticking to the wall
14:14 - uh yeah so once you have this make sure
14:16 - to have dot lower too and change this to
14:18 - d2
14:20 - all right and now once you have all of
14:22 - this done uh let me
14:24 - uh why is there something here not here
14:26 - uh
14:27 - i feel like there's definitely going to
14:29 - be an error
14:30 - d1 balls uh input we're gonna have any
14:33 - point we're gonna have input okay
14:34 - we forgot input i think
14:37 - oh wait
14:38 - did i forget to do oh i forgot sorry
14:41 - guys i forgot to do input here so make
14:43 - sure to have input so that um
14:46 - so that way they can actually respond so
14:48 - let's actually try this out uh triple
14:50 - quote to the detected line 24 okay
14:54 - this one
14:56 - what is wrong with this one wait hold on
15:00 - oh wait it might be wrong with this one
15:01 - actually so we're going to have a little
15:04 - parentheses thing here and then little
15:06 - parentheses thing here and should work
15:08 - no it doesn't work
15:10 - in number three so
15:14 - no this is this works so it's somewhere
15:16 - down here
15:17 - uh
15:18 - let's see
15:19 - here no i don't think that's it
15:22 - so something went wrong uh input number
15:25 - three
15:27 - which is
15:28 - somewhere
15:30 - what if i just delete all this
15:32 - triple quotes and replace them with like
15:34 - single quotes
15:36 - okay let's try a single quote
15:39 - all right
15:41 - okay try it out
15:43 - uh single quotes under under
15:46 - unterminated string literal
15:49 - i think i'm definitely doing something
15:52 - that
15:53 - they don't like um let's try putting
15:55 - this into one long string
15:58 - okay now it goes on to this error okay
16:02 - let's change this to one long string two
16:05 - ctrl x put it into here okay delete this
16:09 - delete this okay let's try it out
16:12 - hopefully it works
16:14 - uh wait why is this oh okay i found out
16:17 - the reason why i was getting the error
16:18 - messages okay control z everything okay
16:22 - i found out and it's very stupid so
16:25 - uh let's let's see
16:28 - all right i think that's back to where
16:29 - we were uh right here i put in an extra
16:33 - set of triple quotes and ah there you go
16:36 - it's fixed okay the wall is coming at
16:39 - you however there's a player defending
16:40 - you what do you do let me wait right the
16:43 - ball is coming at you
16:44 - okay we have to change the story here um
16:46 - and then you can change the story to
16:48 - whatever you want i'm gonna copy and
16:49 - paste my uh d2 so copy
16:54 - remember to copy everything if you
16:56 - already have it
16:58 - including the pick stuff
16:59 - okay so paste all right and now once we
17:02 - have this uh make sure to have dot lower
17:04 - we're gonna print out the thing that if
17:07 - they weren't lucky what they were gonna
17:08 - get so
17:10 - uh the else
17:12 - right here
17:13 - minds is you decide to leap into the air
17:15 - but you
17:17 - you die basically so now you die you
17:19 - sprain your ankle okay those are two
17:21 - very different things spring your ankle
17:23 - and dying okay uh it's still running so
17:25 - we can restart if we want to and let's
17:28 - try it out press enter to start get the
17:30 - ball our way let's wait and you decide
17:32 - to wait blah blah okay nice and now
17:34 - let's try if we get the ball make sure
17:36 - to restart every time because if you
17:38 - don't uh finish pressing enter or
17:41 - filling in the input then it won't work
17:42 - so let's click wait
17:44 - uh we're gonna pass this time let's see
17:47 - what happens
17:48 - okay it doesn't nothing happens because
17:50 - you haven't programmed it to happen i
17:51 - meant to do it for get the ball so get
17:53 - the ball
17:55 - you just had to get the ball you run and
17:56 - loop into the air unfortunately your
17:57 - shoe is untied and you spin your ankle
17:59 - retry that is a great way to end off a
18:01 - fifa world cup as i said earlier um
18:04 - there is no other greatest way
18:06 - i bet it will go into like thousands of
18:07 - compilations saying oh greatest fails of
18:10 - all time you won't believe what happened
18:11 - not clickbait
18:12 - but anyways we're gonna continue with
18:14 - our story uh we're gonna go into d3 now
18:16 - so we're gonna have another if statement
18:19 - uh why is it not doing an if statement
18:21 - oh i need to put down here okay if d2
18:24 - equal equal to
18:26 - uh
18:27 - the correct one so my correct one is
18:28 - pass
18:30 - and make sure it's lowercase again if it
18:31 - equals to pass
18:33 - then we're gonna do d3 d3 equals to
18:37 - input and just copy and paste from d2
18:41 - like so and then grab your story or
18:44 - start writing your story but in my case
18:46 - i'm grabbing it and the three inputs
18:49 - right here so we grab this
18:52 - and then we put it right into here
18:56 - like so
18:57 - all right and now once we have this uh
19:00 - we're gonna
19:01 - [Music]
19:02 - okay i forgot something i forgot to grab
19:05 - pick or shoot right here so that's why
19:07 - it's a bit confusing
19:08 - okay all right and there you go okay uh
19:12 - and now we're gonna print out the wrong
19:14 - one so remember to add the if
19:17 - no sorry not if else and then delete one
19:20 - indentation
19:21 - and print out your story so grab from
19:25 - the elves from d1
19:27 - into this uh my story is that they try
19:31 - to dribble it up field but then somebody
19:33 - tackles them so
19:34 - also another great way to go out uh
19:37 - let's grab this
19:40 - and let's put it into right here
19:44 - okay that should be good and now once we
19:46 - have d2
19:48 - i'm not sorry not d2 d3 uh let's try
19:51 - running it and you can see there's an
19:53 - error um
19:55 - because
19:56 - uh we have to test every time we try it
20:00 - print
20:00 - okay this
20:02 - i think i'm pretty sure it's an error in
20:03 - here so print
20:05 - three aha okay here i didn't add another
20:08 - um colon right there
20:09 - okay there you go
20:11 - uh okay press enter to start the ball is
20:12 - coming we wait and then we
20:15 - let's say we do it wrong so we dribble
20:17 - okay there you go you decide to dribble
20:19 - uh blah blah the defender tackles you
20:21 - right now let's try
20:22 - uh
20:23 - now let's try the other option i really
20:25 - don't know
20:26 - what the other option is so we wait and
20:29 - then we pass yeah pass
20:30 - dang i didn't type pass correctly okay
20:34 - uh enter
20:35 - wait
20:36 - pass okay
20:39 - wait what the heck you just had to pass
20:41 - the ball uh
20:43 - side pass the ball pick shoot or dribble
20:46 - okay that's correct i thought it just
20:47 - repeated the last one okay uh okay and
20:50 - it just says something like that and
20:51 - then this should be the last one because
20:53 - this is getting a little too out of hand
20:55 - if in my opinion so this is probably
20:58 - going to be the last one if you want to
20:59 - continue you can but i haven't i'm
21:01 - pretty sure i'm not going to continue so
21:03 - put another if in here and then we're
21:05 - going to do
21:06 - if d4
21:08 - no we're gonna declare d4 right so if
21:12 - d3
21:14 - equal equals
21:15 - to uh
21:17 - shoot right
21:19 - or what was it uh shoot yeah shoot
21:22 - then
21:23 - then they're correct so we're gonna do
21:25 - d4 which is decision four
21:27 - equals to print because it's the last
21:30 - one no need to do input and then just
21:32 - grab d3
21:36 - like so grab d3
21:40 - triple parentheses bam all right
21:43 - d3 uh and then delete shoot or dribble
21:46 - replace it with u1
21:49 - you win or something and then uh replace
21:52 - the story so i'm going to grab for my d4
21:56 - hello where are you
21:58 - is it wait wait hold on did i print it
22:01 - uh yeah it's right here all right we're
22:03 - gonna grab this
22:04 - and then we put it in here
22:08 - like so and then after that we also need
22:10 - an else so
22:12 - put in else after
22:14 - this one
22:15 - else and then make sure to delete one
22:17 - indentation
22:18 - and print your
22:20 - sad message of them losing so my sad
22:23 - message is you dribble down but um
22:27 - the goalkeeper saves it so
22:29 - so you don't
22:30 - get to score pretty unfortunate but hey
22:32 - that's life all right now let's try to
22:36 - test everything else i mean not else out
22:39 - hopefully it works um hopefully let's
22:41 - restart it again uh but most of the most
22:44 - likely it's gonna come from an error
22:46 - oh no it didn't okay that's very uh
22:48 - relieving to see all right let's press
22:50 - enter to start let's press wait and then
22:53 - pass the reason we're not we're gonna
22:55 - we're not gonna like do dribble or
22:57 - uh
22:58 - or get the ball is because we already
23:00 - know that works we already tested it out
23:01 - that's the good thing about doing your
23:03 - code and then testing it step by step so
23:06 - that way you can go back to the
23:08 - last point you tested it out because it
23:10 - worked right and then you could just
23:11 - find what you just did and then see what
23:13 - you got wrong not just testing it all at
23:15 - the end so once you have done this uh
23:17 - password dribble let's try
23:19 - getting something wrong so let's dribble
23:21 - it out
23:22 - decide to dribble retry okay that's nice
23:25 - and then let's try to uh
23:27 - let's try
23:29 - one second okay let's try shoot
23:31 - hopefully it works and there you go it
23:33 - works all right so that's how to create
23:35 - your own story shoes and game and today
23:38 - we also learned about control flow and
23:40 - logical operators so yeah that it's ep3
23:43 - i hope you enjoyed this series i have
23:45 - fun making it too so yeah if you want to
23:47 - download the notebook again it's in the
23:49 - description entrepreneur book
23:50 - installation is also in the description
23:52 - so yeah thank you for watching see you
23:54 - next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody my name is jimmy and today i will be giving you a brief overview of control flow and logical operators this is ep3 of my wellknown series um that is called teaching myself python so i don't forget python in the future um i don't even know the name of the series but anyways we're going to be continuing on that and today we're going to be learning about control flow and logical operators as i said earlier and we're also going to be making choose you choose your own story kind of game um like where like those books where you have to choose like what uh options you want and then you flip to a different page if you choose like this option then you go to this page this option go to this page and then the book will vary or the ending will vary depending on what you choose so if you chose something good then it would the ending would be good or it could just be like you choose something good then anything would be bad but anyways we're going to be making that sort of um game today and it's going to be very fun um it's going to be mostly writing not coding and sometimes it will get a little complicated so you have to stick with me you can see right here there is a lot of text on screen and but it's all about that you know it's kind of like a story so what uh we're gonna be making this and we're gonna just test what it looks like first right so you can see here this is like a art of somebody playing soccer and this is the person keep goal keeping the goal and again i do not know why this press to enter press enter to start thing is up here even though i clearly put it down here if you have a solution please tell me but i really don't know why this is happening uh and sometimes it doesn't happen you know if i re restart the kernel and try it again yeah see it doesn't happen anymore i really don't know why but anyways it's just wacky and yeah let's get into the story so by this amazing art right here we can tell that we are in the 2024 fifa world cup championships or i don't know and we are in the fight finales or finals and the score is tied two to two there is only 34 seconds left in the game and the the story says to make the correct decisions to win the game by the way i wrote the entire story so if it's bad my fault actually not my fault because it's gonna be good so when you press enter to start they said the ball is coming towards you however there is a player defending you what do you do you either pick get the ball or wait i'm gonna say well i know that i know the like the ending of course but i'm gonna pretend like i don't you know and i'll say let's get the ball and it says you decide to get the ball you run and then leap into the air unfortunately your shoe is untied and you spin your ankle retry and that is a great way to go out in a fifa 2024 world cup definitely and when let's pick weight this time so you decide to wait the ball bounces off the ground harder than the defender anticipated you manage to intercept the ball smoothly and continue what do you do pick pass or dribble uh let's say we're gonna dribble the ball no actually dribbling sounds a bad idea let's try passing the ball you decide to pass the ball you look around searching for your teammate you spot a teammate that is close by you kick the ball with bullet position out of nowhere a defender comes flying into the air but they miss narrowly the ball lands safely to your teammate and he sprints up field near the penalty area he passes it back to you what do you do then there's four seconds left in the game no pressure at all you either shoot or dribble so keep in mind i didn't write this but there's two defenders and a goalkeeper so in total there's three people blocking you from scoring uh but you know let's we're gonna that's like the point so we're gonna let's just dribble you know okay you decide to dribble you dribble towards the goal and the clock is ticking down you do both defenders okay and now you prepare to shoot so it's just you the goalkeeper your foot makes contact with the ball and the only thing stopping you is the goalkeeper he leaps into the air and manages to catch the ball retry you failed because you suck let's try again get the ball so let's wait and then let's pass and then right now let's try to shoot you decide to shoot you get into position for a cannonball of a shot wow your foot makes contact with the ball causing it to go airborne the ball is out of reach from the defenders okay oneonone now and now it's all up to the goalkeeper at the last second the ball curves severely catching the keeper off guard okay he makes a lastditch effort to stop it but it wasn't good enough you won exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point you know that's my story it's um it only has a few like options but you want to continue it you can i was just you know i don't want to write anymore because this is a lot of writing uh it's like six paragraphs or something but yeah that's basically what we're gonna be making today i'm not gonna be rewriting this i'm gonna be using the old text but i'm gonna make it live with you so yeah let's go start up a new notebook really quick let me save this all right everybody i have loaded into a new jupyter notebook and by the way if you don't have jupiter it's going to be in the description you can go uh watch the video that i made on how to get to the notebook it's really easy but anyways once you have done that and open jupiter notebook just type in uh just get open your python 3 ipy kernel and rename it to something you can remember so let's rename this to uh story just choose your own story or something choose your own story like so or you could name whatever you want to make the story about if you have no idea yet then you don't have to name anything um but anyways just choose your own story and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go into uh we're gonna search up ascii art like so just search it up and just click on the first one that appears uh you can see there's a bunch of things for us to choose from animals are design books building and places cartoons clothing accessories comics all this sort of stuff and you can choose whatever you want and once you have it just click into it i'm gonna do sports and outdoors since that's what i did earlier and this is very messed up the gui is not very good let me reload this okay it's still not fixed but that is fine because we're going to be choosing soccer the greatest sport of all time and if you're if you argue with that you're wrong but anyways this is the ascii art for soccer um you can choose any ascii art and then put it into the little jupiter notebook thingy i might choose a different one this time i'm gonna choose like maybe maybe the soccer ball it's not bad soccer ball okay let me pick this one all right and then once you have it selected just press ctrl c and then go back to your um jupiter notebook and then from there let's do print and instead of a normal uh single quote or double quote we're actually going to be putting three single quotes like so and then press enter to twice and then after that control v right into the middle this way it prints the entire thing and not just jumbled up into a mess uh incomplete input incomplete input what are you talking about it has some uh double quotes not double quotes single quotes in this uh it's okay i'll just replace it there you go there you go looks good as new and search for more single quotes it doesn't look like there is so let's try it out oh no that's a little messed up but you can see that this line right here is messed up the line right before s and t and that is a very easy fix so just press enter right here cut this line where it's messed up off and try running again all right if it doesn't work then you press the wrong line so we're gonna go uh with this one then okay and now let's try running again uh it's nearly fixed we just need a little bit more so up here too there you go it's fixed so that's how to fix it actually in my fifa story i had to cut off this middle lane right here because of that too so yeah that is how to fix your ascii art if it ever gets broken just enter in the lines that are broken and you should have it working all right but now it doesn't really look that clean right so i want a little border that will separate it from my text so i'm going to just copy this thing you can have anything you could just have underscores if you want underscores might look better actually or just dashes i could just do dashes too like so and then copy this and then put at the top too and then uh press run and there you go that looks pretty good if it's too wide then just delete a little bit okay one two three four all right and run it again there you go looks pretty good and now from then we're going to print a little welcome message so we're going to have it in the normal uh quotation marks if you want on one line but i wanted i wanted to have a little longer x longer um introduction so i'm going to have the three little single quotes again and then my introduction will be uh this one right here you can make your own introduction just uh tell them the settings where they are and like make the correct decisions to win the game or something and by the way if you want this notebook it's in the description so you could use my story too um there's no copyright so you're not plagiarizing but anyways this is my introduction and let's try running this uh there you go welcome to the fifa world cup and if it's like a little too far indented here we could just delete this one and then it should be less indented there you go and welcome to the fifa world club blah blah okay once our introduction is done let me put a little comment saying introduction intro okay and now we're gonna ask them to start so we're gonna ask them start question mark and this is the part where i keep on getting an error well not an error but it's just wacky it's where this thing the input goes up below or above the text sometimes so yeah use this if you want but you don't have to either so press enter to start let's try it again you can see it goes up but now let's try restarting the kernel okay let's try again and you see it goes back down it's very weird i don't know i don't know why but uh that is uh or press enter to start so once you press enter it doesn't do anything because we haven't told to do anything but after we gave them a little starting thingy we're going to ask them the first question on what they're going to do so you can see right here d1 so we're going to make a variable first let's make actually i'm a question one all right so we're going to set a variable called d1 this is for decision one d1 equals two and then your question i'm going to put this in three single quotes again just so that i can go on multiple lines so that so that way it looks better instead of just one long text it's just more you know more uh gradual so the reader actually wants to read it and it looks longer so it looks nicer and then after that grab your introduction thingy and let me tell you the basics of this so the basics of all this is just tell them uh what their what what where they are and what is the problem so like you tell them the ball is coming towards you but there is a problem the there's somebody defending you what do you do you either pick get the ball or wait this is very vital down here pick the ball or white um if you don't give them an option they're just going to print whatever so you have to give them either option and then after that put dot lower with two parentheses at the end right here to make sure that whatever they type in it's always going to be lowercase that way we can use our if else statements pretty easily without any errors so once we have done this we're just going to set up our first if statement so if d1 equal equal to whatever is the correct option so if get the ball was the correct option you would put get the ball in here but in my case weight is the correct option so equals to weight make sure everything is lower case by the way that is very very important and once you have done that we're just going to put a colon at the end and then from there we're going to print um our like congratulations to them or something so whatever uh story the what sorry whatever story you have next put that in here so uh do input input or not sorry d2 uh equals to input input and hey stop input and there's story down here my story will be in triple quotes again you could use single quote or quotation marks if you want but i'm going to make it a little bit longer and then after you have that don't write anything yet by the way you're gonna have an else statement so else uh you if they say like get the ball or something we'll say the print something that is saying that they didn't make it or some a story that plays out so in my case i say like they sprained their ankle or something but you can it's up to you and so let's uh now write the one that is correct so d2 input and then just start writing in my case i'm copying pasting but yeah that is uh that is it and then i need my uh pick or password dribble my my recommendation for you is to just copy d1 and just paste it in d2 like that but make sure the indenting is correct and by the way the text indentation is very uh weird so you might need to play around with that it can be anywhere if it's especially if it's towards this corner it will look better if it's outside then like if you indented it twice then when it prints out it's also indented twice so i recommend just sticking to the wall uh yeah so once you have this make sure to have dot lower too and change this to d2 all right and now once you have all of this done uh let me uh why is there something here not here uh i feel like there's definitely going to be an error d1 balls uh input we're gonna have any point we're gonna have input okay we forgot input i think oh wait did i forget to do oh i forgot sorry guys i forgot to do input here so make sure to have input so that um so that way they can actually respond so let's actually try this out uh triple quote to the detected line 24 okay this one what is wrong with this one wait hold on oh wait it might be wrong with this one actually so we're going to have a little parentheses thing here and then little parentheses thing here and should work no it doesn't work in number three so no this is this works so it's somewhere down here uh let's see here no i don't think that's it so something went wrong uh input number three which is somewhere what if i just delete all this triple quotes and replace them with like single quotes okay let's try a single quote all right okay try it out uh single quotes under under unterminated string literal i think i'm definitely doing something that they don't like um let's try putting this into one long string okay now it goes on to this error okay let's change this to one long string two ctrl x put it into here okay delete this delete this okay let's try it out hopefully it works uh wait why is this oh okay i found out the reason why i was getting the error messages okay control z everything okay i found out and it's very stupid so uh let's let's see all right i think that's back to where we were uh right here i put in an extra set of triple quotes and ah there you go it's fixed okay the wall is coming at you however there's a player defending you what do you do let me wait right the ball is coming at you okay we have to change the story here um and then you can change the story to whatever you want i'm gonna copy and paste my uh d2 so copy remember to copy everything if you already have it including the pick stuff okay so paste all right and now once we have this uh make sure to have dot lower we're gonna print out the thing that if they weren't lucky what they were gonna get so uh the else right here minds is you decide to leap into the air but you you die basically so now you die you sprain your ankle okay those are two very different things spring your ankle and dying okay uh it's still running so we can restart if we want to and let's try it out press enter to start get the ball our way let's wait and you decide to wait blah blah okay nice and now let's try if we get the ball make sure to restart every time because if you don't uh finish pressing enter or filling in the input then it won't work so let's click wait uh we're gonna pass this time let's see what happens okay it doesn't nothing happens because you haven't programmed it to happen i meant to do it for get the ball so get the ball you just had to get the ball you run and loop into the air unfortunately your shoe is untied and you spin your ankle retry that is a great way to end off a fifa world cup as i said earlier um there is no other greatest way i bet it will go into like thousands of compilations saying oh greatest fails of all time you won't believe what happened not clickbait but anyways we're gonna continue with our story uh we're gonna go into d3 now so we're gonna have another if statement uh why is it not doing an if statement oh i need to put down here okay if d2 equal equal to uh the correct one so my correct one is pass and make sure it's lowercase again if it equals to pass then we're gonna do d3 d3 equals to input and just copy and paste from d2 like so and then grab your story or start writing your story but in my case i'm grabbing it and the three inputs right here so we grab this and then we put it right into here like so all right and now once we have this uh we're gonna okay i forgot something i forgot to grab pick or shoot right here so that's why it's a bit confusing okay all right and there you go okay uh and now we're gonna print out the wrong one so remember to add the if no sorry not if else and then delete one indentation and print out your story so grab from the elves from d1 into this uh my story is that they try to dribble it up field but then somebody tackles them so also another great way to go out uh let's grab this and let's put it into right here okay that should be good and now once we have d2 i'm not sorry not d2 d3 uh let's try running it and you can see there's an error um because uh we have to test every time we try it print okay this i think i'm pretty sure it's an error in here so print three aha okay here i didn't add another um colon right there okay there you go uh okay press enter to start the ball is coming we wait and then we let's say we do it wrong so we dribble okay there you go you decide to dribble uh blah blah the defender tackles you right now let's try uh now let's try the other option i really don't know what the other option is so we wait and then we pass yeah pass dang i didn't type pass correctly okay uh enter wait pass okay wait what the heck you just had to pass the ball uh side pass the ball pick shoot or dribble okay that's correct i thought it just repeated the last one okay uh okay and it just says something like that and then this should be the last one because this is getting a little too out of hand if in my opinion so this is probably going to be the last one if you want to continue you can but i haven't i'm pretty sure i'm not going to continue so put another if in here and then we're going to do if d4 no we're gonna declare d4 right so if d3 equal equals to uh shoot right or what was it uh shoot yeah shoot then then they're correct so we're gonna do d4 which is decision four equals to print because it's the last one no need to do input and then just grab d3 like so grab d3 triple parentheses bam all right d3 uh and then delete shoot or dribble replace it with u1 you win or something and then uh replace the story so i'm going to grab for my d4 hello where are you is it wait wait hold on did i print it uh yeah it's right here all right we're gonna grab this and then we put it in here like so and then after that we also need an else so put in else after this one else and then make sure to delete one indentation and print your sad message of them losing so my sad message is you dribble down but um the goalkeeper saves it so so you don't get to score pretty unfortunate but hey that's life all right now let's try to test everything else i mean not else out hopefully it works um hopefully let's restart it again uh but most of the most likely it's gonna come from an error oh no it didn't okay that's very uh relieving to see all right let's press enter to start let's press wait and then pass the reason we're not we're gonna we're not gonna like do dribble or uh or get the ball is because we already know that works we already tested it out that's the good thing about doing your code and then testing it step by step so that way you can go back to the last point you tested it out because it worked right and then you could just find what you just did and then see what you got wrong not just testing it all at the end so once you have done this uh password dribble let's try getting something wrong so let's dribble it out decide to dribble retry okay that's nice and then let's try to uh let's try one second okay let's try shoot hopefully it works and there you go it works all right so that's how to create your own story shoes and game and today we also learned about control flow and logical operators so yeah that it's ep3 i hope you enjoyed this series i have fun making it too so yeah if you want to download the notebook again it's in the description entrepreneur book installation is also in the description so yeah thank you for watching see you next time bye
