00:00 - hello everyone and uh welcome back to
00:03 - python ep
00:04 - 6. um and today i'm going to be showing
00:06 - you orders of operations
00:08 - which is um ranking the math equations
00:12 - so like rank number one there is the
00:15 - parentheses
00:16 - ranked number two is exponents number
00:19 - three
00:20 - is multiplication and division and
00:23 - number four
00:25 - is addition subtraction now you're
00:27 - probably wondering
00:28 - multiplication and division are the same
00:30 - level then how can we distinguish which
00:32 - one comes first or last
00:34 - so how did this doing distinguish this
00:37 - is that
00:38 - um whoever comes first
00:41 - so like pretend this is an equation four
00:45 - times let me see four times
00:48 - three divided by one this is totally
00:50 - random okay
00:52 - um the four times three gonna come first
00:55 - because
00:56 - it's going to be um the first
00:59 - equation that comes up however if it was
01:03 - like this then
01:06 - 1 divided by 4 would be first because
01:09 - the equation comes before times three
01:12 - okay however if um
01:15 - for addition subtraction if it were to
01:18 - do that two
01:20 - one the subtract by four and then
01:23 - plus three then uh
01:27 - subtraction would come first addition
01:28 - would come last and if you were to
01:31 - switch it around like
01:32 - this um
01:35 - like so then addition would come first
01:40 - so yeah it's pretty simple it's not that
01:42 - hard
01:43 - uh i think you guys can do it and yeah
01:46 - let's get right into it
01:47 - so as i was saying guys um x
01:50 - should equal to let's do parentheses
01:54 - three minus one
01:58 - and then plus two
02:02 - then print
02:06 - well this isn't really gonna work is it
02:08 - so what if we do
02:11 - times two
02:16 - x here we go
02:20 - four so um however if we put out the
02:24 - parentheses
02:25 - it wouldn't equal four anymore one so
02:28 - you guys
02:28 - so parentheses matter because if we put
02:32 - parentheses in here then it would mean
02:35 - for three subtracted by one
02:37 - to be done first before um it times two
02:40 - so yeah that's
02:41 - how to do parentheses it's pretty easy
02:44 - but if we had no parentheses then it
02:46 - would do one times two first instead of
02:49 - three subtracted by one so yeah that's
02:51 - the
02:52 - um ranking of orders of operation it
02:54 - applies to every single math equation
02:57 - so in python and normal math
03:00 - uh i think in every programming language
03:03 - uh so yeah
03:04 - you guys should keep in mind with this
03:06 - because if you do something
03:07 - wrong and your equation turns out the
03:10 - wrong answer then your program would go
03:13 - into
03:13 - jeopardy jeopardy because um it's going
03:16 - to
03:17 - like not work because the equation is
03:20 - wrong
03:21 - so yeah keep in mind also operation um
03:24 - it's going to be very useful later so
03:27 - yeah
03:28 - just keep in mind about that and um
03:32 - yeah so let me just show you another
03:34 - equation it's
03:36 - uh pretty simple i have a let's do
03:38 - exponents okay
03:40 - we put parentheses in three subtract by
03:44 - one
03:44 - and then exponented
03:48 - so exponent is two multiplication two
03:50 - times
03:51 - by two so it's going to be
03:54 - i predict it's four okay
03:57 - as you can see it's four but if we take
03:59 - out
04:00 - this then it's two because one exponent
04:04 - by two
04:05 - is one and then subtracted by three is
04:08 - two
04:09 - but if we do a parenthesis first like
04:12 - this then um three subtracted by one
04:16 - would become first so it would be two
04:18 - and then two um um by the power of two
04:21 - would be two times two which would
04:25 - equal to four so yeah that's the power
04:28 - of orders of operation and the power of
04:30 - parentheses because if you want an
04:33 - equation to come first just put the
04:34 - parentheses around it
04:36 - what if we do something like this what
04:38 - do you think will come
04:39 - first okay
04:43 - it's gonna be um so three
04:46 - x by the power of one would equal three
04:50 - and then by the power of
04:51 - two would equal nine okay so
04:55 - um it would equal nine because
04:58 - it will do this first
05:02 - which would equal um
05:05 - three as i said before but however if
05:07 - they do
05:08 - this first which we could by putting
05:11 - parentheses around it then would totally
05:13 - change it up because this would now
05:15 - equal one um by the power of two would
05:19 - equal to one
05:20 - and then three by the power of one
05:21 - equals to one so it's not nine anymore
05:24 - not nine anymore so let me just try it
05:27 - as you can see it's three but if we
05:30 - take this out then it should be nine
05:34 - what three exponent by one equals
05:38 - three and then three by the power of two
05:43 - is nine or am i missing something here
05:48 - hold up let me just go grab a calculator
05:53 - [Music]
05:58 - is it though
06:02 - okay let me just um
06:07 - three you know what it's okay
06:11 - let me just try to figure it out so
06:15 - why does it do this
06:18 - print it equals to
06:21 - three three by the power of one
06:26 - am i missing something here three by the
06:28 - power of one
06:30 - what is the power
06:34 - three right yes then three
06:37 - exponent by two
06:41 - it's still three that shouldn't what
06:45 - okay who cares let me just try
06:47 - explaining this in front
06:49 - maybe that will help this is
06:52 - so weird it's first come first serve to
06:55 - the right
06:56 - now it's nine for some reason huh
06:59 - no if you
07:02 - oh you can't
07:05 - [Music]
07:06 - oh that's why you never see any equation
07:08 - with like
07:10 - two exponents behind them because you
07:12 - can't so you need a parenthesis
07:14 - and then you would exponent oh i get it
07:16 - now okay
07:17 - so you need a parenthesis if you're
07:19 - going to exponent um
07:20 - a number by two times then you need
07:23 - parentheses around the first equation
07:25 - and then you put the um times
07:28 - uh by the power of two at the end which
07:31 - would make it
07:31 - um the number that you want it to be if
07:34 - you don't put the parentheses however
07:36 - if this section behind it won't work so
07:38 - remember to put the parentheses
07:40 - you're going to use exponents okay so
07:42 - yeah that's it for this video
07:44 - i hope you found something useful i
07:46 - certainly did because i didn't know that
07:48 - this
07:48 - even exists in the first place so i must
07:51 - have done something wrong in the past
07:53 - so yeah bye see you next video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and uh welcome back to python ep 6. um and today i'm going to be showing you orders of operations which is um ranking the math equations so like rank number one there is the parentheses ranked number two is exponents number three is multiplication and division and number four is addition subtraction now you're probably wondering multiplication and division are the same level then how can we distinguish which one comes first or last so how did this doing distinguish this is that um whoever comes first so like pretend this is an equation four times let me see four times three divided by one this is totally random okay um the four times three gonna come first because it's going to be um the first equation that comes up however if it was like this then 1 divided by 4 would be first because the equation comes before times three okay however if um for addition subtraction if it were to do that two one the subtract by four and then plus three then uh subtraction would come first addition would come last and if you were to switch it around like this um like so then addition would come first so yeah it's pretty simple it's not that hard uh i think you guys can do it and yeah let's get right into it so as i was saying guys um x should equal to let's do parentheses three minus one and then plus two then print well this isn't really gonna work is it so what if we do times two x here we go four so um however if we put out the parentheses it wouldn't equal four anymore one so you guys so parentheses matter because if we put parentheses in here then it would mean for three subtracted by one to be done first before um it times two so yeah that's how to do parentheses it's pretty easy but if we had no parentheses then it would do one times two first instead of three subtracted by one so yeah that's the um ranking of orders of operation it applies to every single math equation so in python and normal math uh i think in every programming language uh so yeah you guys should keep in mind with this because if you do something wrong and your equation turns out the wrong answer then your program would go into jeopardy jeopardy because um it's going to like not work because the equation is wrong so yeah keep in mind also operation um it's going to be very useful later so yeah just keep in mind about that and um yeah so let me just show you another equation it's uh pretty simple i have a let's do exponents okay we put parentheses in three subtract by one and then exponented so exponent is two multiplication two times by two so it's going to be i predict it's four okay as you can see it's four but if we take out this then it's two because one exponent by two is one and then subtracted by three is two but if we do a parenthesis first like this then um three subtracted by one would become first so it would be two and then two um um by the power of two would be two times two which would equal to four so yeah that's the power of orders of operation and the power of parentheses because if you want an equation to come first just put the parentheses around it what if we do something like this what do you think will come first okay it's gonna be um so three x by the power of one would equal three and then by the power of two would equal nine okay so um it would equal nine because it will do this first which would equal um three as i said before but however if they do this first which we could by putting parentheses around it then would totally change it up because this would now equal one um by the power of two would equal to one and then three by the power of one equals to one so it's not nine anymore not nine anymore so let me just try it as you can see it's three but if we take this out then it should be nine what three exponent by one equals three and then three by the power of two is nine or am i missing something here hold up let me just go grab a calculator is it though okay let me just um three you know what it's okay let me just try to figure it out so why does it do this print it equals to three three by the power of one am i missing something here three by the power of one what is the power three right yes then three exponent by two it's still three that shouldn't what okay who cares let me just try explaining this in front maybe that will help this is so weird it's first come first serve to the right now it's nine for some reason huh no if you oh you can't oh that's why you never see any equation with like two exponents behind them because you can't so you need a parenthesis and then you would exponent oh i get it now okay so you need a parenthesis if you're going to exponent um a number by two times then you need parentheses around the first equation and then you put the um times uh by the power of two at the end which would make it um the number that you want it to be if you don't put the parentheses however if this section behind it won't work so remember to put the parentheses you're going to use exponents okay so yeah that's it for this video i hope you found something useful i certainly did because i didn't know that this even exists in the first place so i must have done something wrong in the past so yeah bye see you next video
