00:00 - [Music]
00:12 - hello my name is jeremy and today i'm
00:14 - going to be showing you
00:15 - how to make lists in python right now
00:17 - we're in python module
00:19 - so why don't we get started first of all
00:21 - what is a list
00:22 - a list is basically an array it's
00:26 - like a variable but instead of storing
00:28 - only one number
00:29 - or um or string this can store
00:33 - many strings which is multiple of them
00:36 - and
00:36 - i think it's going to be very useful so
00:38 - i'm going to teach you how to do it
00:40 - first of all let's see what's a list in
00:42 - real life a closet right
00:44 - it holds books um like if you're like me
00:47 - and put books in it
00:48 - um shoes clothes and jackets
00:51 - so why don't we set a closet as a list
00:54 - so first of all to make a list you need
00:56 - to do closet um or whatever you want as
00:59 - a list
00:59 - equals to and then put a bracket
01:03 - which is right below the
01:06 - plus sign and then we do what is
01:10 - in the closet so there is clothes as you
01:12 - said
01:14 - clothes um remember to put the single
01:17 - quotes
01:17 - slash quotation marks clothes
01:21 - uh books
01:27 - um jackets
01:31 - and finally shoes
01:35 - okay and you have to keep oh sorry
01:38 - and you also need to keep in mind that
01:41 - jackets
01:42 - i mean um this list
01:45 - is counting from zero so close is zero
01:48 - number zero number one number two number
01:50 - three so if you want
01:51 - choose which number is it three right
01:55 - yes because it counts from zero so don't
01:57 - get confused with that because
01:58 - we are going to have to pull specific
02:00 - ones later on so yeah
02:02 - keep in mind that it starts from zero so
02:04 - moving on
02:05 - is to add something to the list
02:08 - so what we say is to append it
02:11 - and so this is how to do it so we put
02:15 - the list name in dot append
02:18 - this is how you call a pen and then you
02:20 - put in what you want to append
02:22 - so like i want to append oops
02:25 - yeah i want to append uh sneakers then
02:29 - because i just bought them like this
02:32 - enter and then print print closet
02:36 - which is to print the whole list print
02:39 - and then you got to do these
02:42 - flaws here we go so print closet and
02:45 - let's see what it does
02:48 - um well we have to run it i forgot
02:52 - run module
02:56 - and it says oh you see
03:00 - uh where should i save it i'm just
03:02 - saving my desktop then
03:05 - okay and save
03:11 - downloads okay save
03:14 - okay so right now i'm actually
03:18 - in the wrong thing we're not doing
03:20 - python module
03:21 - but we're actually going to do python
03:23 - shell which is different
03:24 - so search up id leu with me sorry for
03:27 - that guys
03:28 - so this is kind of similar but instead
03:32 - of that okay just paste it okay just
03:34 - paste it
03:36 - and then sorry and then
03:39 - um after this uh like this right guys
03:44 - then what we do is we just do something
03:46 - like this click enter
03:48 - and then we just type in
03:51 - sorry type copy this
03:55 - okay put it in here
03:59 - copy this and then click enter
04:03 - and put it back in so as you can see
04:05 - it's added in sneakers
04:07 - and um so there's clothes book jackets
04:10 - choosing sneakers
04:12 - and here we are so we have at first it
04:15 - was closed book jackets and shoes but
04:17 - now we added sneakers in
04:18 - what if the um the person with the
04:21 - closet so pretend me
04:22 - i i'm about to go to school so i take my
04:25 - books out
04:26 - and uh what will happen to the list the
04:29 - book is going to be gone right
04:31 - so to make something get removed is
04:34 - pretty simple it's kind of like a pen
04:36 - closet dot remove
04:40 - and then what do we want um which one do
04:43 - we want to remove
04:44 - so we put a bracket we put a bracket
04:48 - and then we put um closet
04:51 - wait bracket right yeah bracket and then
04:54 - after that we put
04:55 - claws uh oh oopsies over here it needs
04:58 - to be a parenthesis
04:59 - not this bracket okay so we put
05:02 - closet and uh now a bracket
05:06 - and we put what number we want out okay
05:09 - so
05:10 - books is number one so you put it in
05:13 - like that
05:13 - and click enter now you print it print
05:17 - closet like so
05:20 - enter see and books is gone so i took
05:22 - the books out
05:24 - went to school and it came back so
05:27 - um i want to put my books back in my
05:29 - closet so how do i put it back
05:31 - a pen append is um putting it back
05:36 - but uh it's putting it
05:40 - it's also there's another one and this
05:43 - one
05:43 - is to put a specific position a pen is
05:46 - just putting in
05:47 - like right here the end as you can see
05:50 - sneakers
05:51 - but this one that i'm going to do it's
05:52 - going to put in the position
05:54 - like an accurate one so i'm going to
05:57 - show you what it is
05:58 - it's called insert um it's like the
06:00 - other ones
06:01 - the code is similar closet dot insert
06:05 - and then like what do we want to insert
06:07 - we want to insert
06:09 - uh our books back right so we're going
06:11 - to say
06:12 - um parentheses and then where do we want
06:16 - it
06:16 - so this is what this is zero one
06:21 - two and three right so i'm going to put
06:24 - it back in the same position
06:26 - which is number one so one comma
06:30 - little bun bun one comma space and then
06:34 - we're going to put
06:35 - uh what we want in so we want the books
06:38 - back in right
06:39 - books and then we put the parentheses in
06:42 - so now we're going to print it
06:45 - print closet
06:49 - oh closet right yeah closet and then
06:52 - click enter
06:53 - and there we go boxes back into the
06:55 - closet
06:57 - nice and back it's home okay now we're
06:59 - going to
07:00 - show another thing for remove so pretend
07:03 - um my shoes are getting old okay and i
07:06 - want to
07:07 - just like get rid of it well how do i do
07:10 - that you can
07:10 - you remove but there's another easier um
07:14 - another alternative way which is called
07:17 - um deleting
07:18 - so uh first of all what we do is we do
07:21 - dell stands for delete and then
07:25 - what we do is we go and we label which
07:28 - one we want
07:29 - so uh closet
07:32 - closet don't put you don't need to put
07:35 - parentheses around this
07:36 - and we put a bracket and say choose
07:39 - right they're getting old so
07:41 - choose is number three and three
07:44 - like this boom and then we print
07:48 - closet let's see if shoes is gone
07:52 - and tada shoes is gone so instead of
07:55 - shoes i have the sneakers now
07:56 - because the shoes are old now they're
07:58 - gone okay so
07:59 - it's now what if i want like i have two
08:03 - money in my list
08:04 - like too many in my list so i want to
08:07 - find
08:07 - the specific one i want to print it out
08:10 - so what i do
08:11 - is i um i go like this
08:15 - print and then uh
08:19 - garage so we're gonna um
08:23 - print a specific one so what if i want
08:26 - my jackets and you couldn't find it from
08:27 - my clothes
08:28 - right so jackets is number two so like
08:31 - this
08:32 - and there you go we printed the jacket
08:35 - oh no whoopsies now um you don't have to
08:39 - put in the uh how do you call it you
08:42 - don't need to put
08:43 - in uh the
08:46 - uh you need to put like
08:49 - the negative sign in front of it first
08:50 - so
08:52 - well this is a way i uh think you need
08:55 - to do it so garage right
08:57 - and then like this but instead of doing
09:01 - that we're going to do negative
09:02 - so now it's going to be a little bit
09:04 - more complicated this way works for me
09:06 - but for some reason i this way doesn't
09:08 - work hmm
09:09 - that's kind of weird oh what a prank
09:11 - garage
09:13 - i think a closet is a garage oh my
09:16 - goodness
09:17 - jimmy what in the world okay so um
09:20 - closet sorry guys they bring um
09:22 - [Music]
09:24 - closet two and this should work i'm like
09:28 - why doesn't it work there we go jackets
09:31 - and then
09:32 - he realized um
09:36 - so yeah don't forget to print the
09:38 - correct
09:39 - one my brain just stopped working for
09:42 - some reason and just print garage
09:44 - so yeah remember to print the exact name
09:47 - of your list it's very case sensitive
09:50 - and you can't even mix up a
09:51 - capitalization
09:53 - okay so that's one way of doing it i
09:55 - just spoiled you the second way oh why
09:57 - so another way is to print um
10:00 - it's an alternative i don't know why
10:02 - anybody would want to use this way
10:04 - but um it's another way i guess
10:07 - so instead of counting 0 1
10:10 - 2 3 we're going to count backwards so
10:13 - this is going to be
10:14 - starting from y not 0 1 two
10:18 - three four more specifically negative
10:21 - one negative two negative three negative
10:22 - four
10:23 - okay so now we're going to print it
10:25 - using that method
10:27 - print closet
10:30 - closet and um
10:34 - negative which one so we want jackets
10:36 - again so it needs to be negative
10:38 - two like so
10:42 - um whoops one and like that
10:46 - and now it's going to be jacket see so
10:48 - you could count backwards or forwards it
10:50 - just depends
10:51 - okay so after this um what else are we
10:54 - going to do with lists
10:56 - what other commands is there what if you
10:59 - have
11:00 - a specific um a specific
11:04 - clothe that you really like so you could
11:06 - name it
11:07 - something like this so we're going to
11:10 - say
11:10 - um and you're going to like just
11:14 - pop it off so which means dot pop
11:18 - it means just like use it one time and
11:21 - it's gone
11:22 - so what if we're going to set
11:25 - um it as one of my
11:28 - books so we could say harry potter
11:32 - okay that's one of my favorite books
11:34 - harry potter um
11:37 - equals harry potter
11:40 - equals um
11:43 - how about let's just say hp for short
11:45 - because it's pretty long
11:47 - hp equals um
11:51 - closet right wait parentheses i think
11:55 - closet
11:58 - wait no do you need no i don't think you
12:02 - do
12:02 - okay just how let's try this closet dot
12:06 - pop and then we select which one we want
12:08 - so
12:09 - i would want um which one books right
12:13 - yeah so
12:15 - let's just do the fancy way so negative
12:18 - three
12:18 - there we go and then now we click enter
12:22 - and this is going to pop it off which
12:24 - means that it's just going to take it
12:25 - out
12:26 - single use it shows one and then it's
12:29 - like basically deleting and printing at
12:31 - the same time
12:32 - so if we say print
12:36 - print hp
12:40 - i just realized it says hp also stands
12:43 - for health points
12:44 - oh and games you know
12:47 - and click enter it says books but what
12:50 - if we do this
12:52 - again do you think it's going to be
12:55 - books
12:57 - do you no it wouldn't be books
13:00 - i mean sorry yes it would be books
13:02 - because
13:03 - it's going to pop it off but if we
13:06 - however just print um
13:08 - [Music]
13:10 - print uh how do you call it closet right
13:13 - if we would just print closet then
13:17 - this would not have books okay
13:20 - because we popped it off but if we just
13:22 - say print hp
13:24 - then there is going to be books because
13:26 - it's like separated from each other
13:27 - basically
13:28 - and yeah that's um pop
13:32 - okay moving on is to print the
13:36 - what if we would want to change
13:39 - something without having to delete it
13:40 - and append it
13:41 - or um insert it again then what we would
13:44 - do
13:45 - is we would do like the name
13:48 - of the very uh the the list first right
13:51 - guys
13:52 - and then we would um
13:55 - we would do over here
13:59 - and which one do you want to change so
14:01 - how let's change
14:02 - clothes okay so it's zero
14:06 - let's change clothes to
14:10 - hmm sweatshirts
14:14 - sweat wait let me just sweat
14:17 - shirts okay
14:20 - just like so click enter now we print
14:24 - closet let's see
14:27 - and kaboom boo you go sweatshirts
14:30 - i changed clothes to sweatshirts and
14:33 - um yeah that's pretty much everything
14:37 - with the um list so i hope you guys
14:40 - found something useful
14:42 - in this video i really do like take a
14:45 - lot of time
14:46 - learning this and coming to teach you
14:48 - guys so yeah if you would like then that
14:50 - would be great and subscribe
14:52 - thank you a lot and see you next video
14:54 - bye

hello my name is jeremy and today i'm going to be showing you how to make lists in python right now we're in python module so why don't we get started first of all what is a list a list is basically an array it's like a variable but instead of storing only one number or um or string this can store many strings which is multiple of them and i think it's going to be very useful so i'm going to teach you how to do it first of all let's see what's a list in real life a closet right it holds books um like if you're like me and put books in it um shoes clothes and jackets so why don't we set a closet as a list so first of all to make a list you need to do closet um or whatever you want as a list equals to and then put a bracket which is right below the plus sign and then we do what is in the closet so there is clothes as you said clothes um remember to put the single quotes slash quotation marks clothes uh books um jackets and finally shoes okay and you have to keep oh sorry and you also need to keep in mind that jackets i mean um this list is counting from zero so close is zero number zero number one number two number three so if you want choose which number is it three right yes because it counts from zero so don't get confused with that because we are going to have to pull specific ones later on so yeah keep in mind that it starts from zero so moving on is to add something to the list so what we say is to append it and so this is how to do it so we put the list name in dot append this is how you call a pen and then you put in what you want to append so like i want to append oops yeah i want to append uh sneakers then because i just bought them like this enter and then print print closet which is to print the whole list print and then you got to do these flaws here we go so print closet and let's see what it does um well we have to run it i forgot run module and it says oh you see uh where should i save it i'm just saving my desktop then okay and save downloads okay save okay so right now i'm actually in the wrong thing we're not doing python module but we're actually going to do python shell which is different so search up id leu with me sorry for that guys so this is kind of similar but instead of that okay just paste it okay just paste it and then sorry and then um after this uh like this right guys then what we do is we just do something like this click enter and then we just type in sorry type copy this okay put it in here copy this and then click enter and put it back in so as you can see it's added in sneakers and um so there's clothes book jackets choosing sneakers and here we are so we have at first it was closed book jackets and shoes but now we added sneakers in what if the um the person with the closet so pretend me i i'm about to go to school so i take my books out and uh what will happen to the list the book is going to be gone right so to make something get removed is pretty simple it's kind of like a pen closet dot remove and then what do we want um which one do we want to remove so we put a bracket we put a bracket and then we put um closet wait bracket right yeah bracket and then after that we put claws uh oh oopsies over here it needs to be a parenthesis not this bracket okay so we put closet and uh now a bracket and we put what number we want out okay so books is number one so you put it in like that and click enter now you print it print closet like so enter see and books is gone so i took the books out went to school and it came back so um i want to put my books back in my closet so how do i put it back a pen append is um putting it back but uh it's putting it it's also there's another one and this one is to put a specific position a pen is just putting in like right here the end as you can

have two money in my list like too many in my list so i want to find the specific one i want to print it out so what i do is i um i go like this print and then uh garage so we're gonna um print a specific one so what if i want my jackets and you couldn't find it from my clothes right so jackets is number two so like this and there you go we printed the jacket oh no whoopsies now um you don't

let's change clothes okay so it's zero let's change clothes to hmm sweatshirts sweat wait let me just sweat shirts okay just like so click enter now we print closet let's see and kaboom boo you go sweatshirts i changed clothes to sweatshirts and um yeah that's pretty much everything with the um list so i hope you guys found something useful in this video i really do like take a lot of time learning this and coming to teach you guys so yeah if you would like then that would be great and subscribe thank you a lot and see you next video bye
