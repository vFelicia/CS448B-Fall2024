00:00 - hi guys my name is jemmy and today i'm
00:02 - going to be showing you
00:03 - um how to calculate your bmi which is
00:06 - how fat
00:06 - you are
00:07 - [Music]
00:12 - um so the way to calculate it is
00:15 - actually pretty simple
00:16 - let us name our subject first bmi
00:20 - um and then how to calculate it is
00:24 - to have your weight that is
00:27 - in kilogram form
00:30 - oh and then divided by your height
00:35 - which your height which is in your um
00:38 - which is in meter form times your height
00:41 - so
00:42 - it's gonna look something like
00:45 - this uh at the end so basically what you
00:49 - do is get your
00:50 - um high times height and then divide it
00:53 - by
00:53 - your weight and then it's your bmi so
00:56 - yeah let's get right into it and we're
00:58 - going to put inputs into this so that
00:59 - they can enter their own weight and
01:01 - height
01:02 - so um let's get started so the first
01:05 - process
01:06 - is to get the input in okay
01:09 - so there's going to be input and we're
01:12 - going to ask them to
01:13 - enter your
01:16 - way here like this and after that
01:21 - um what you do is you go
01:24 - wait no and then you put enter your
01:26 - weight as a kilogram form right here
01:29 - enter your weight here and then
01:30 - something like that then they're going
01:32 - to enter their weight
01:34 - and how about let's just put this as a
01:37 - variable
01:38 - as h no h is for height
01:41 - for w okay and um since we're going to
01:44 - put this
01:46 - along with uh an integer
01:49 - we need to um change this to an integer
01:51 - 2. so what you
01:52 - should do is get another parenthesis
01:55 - around
01:56 - this input and outside you put int
01:59 - and behind this you put another
02:00 - parenthesis like this and then now you
02:02 - convert
02:02 - this into integer not it's not a string
02:05 - anymore it's now
02:06 - an integer so yeah after that let's get
02:09 - your height
02:10 - height equals to integer same thing
02:14 - input and then um another parenthesis
02:18 - enter enter
02:22 - your height
02:25 - here and then remember to put um height
02:28 - as
02:29 - meter so that we know like centimeter or
02:31 - meter
02:32 - actually you know what however let's
02:34 - just do centimeter because then we can
02:35 - still convert it
02:37 - so enter your centimeter of the height
02:40 - here
02:41 - and there we go um that's how they'll
02:44 - enter their height
02:44 - and weight okay after that what you do
02:47 - is you
02:48 - get your um you get your height
02:52 - to convert into a centimeter so
02:55 - i mean can um convert your height from a
02:58 - centimeter to a meter
02:59 - so how would you do that is h
03:02 - equals to um h divided by a hundred
03:06 - which means that right here you can see
03:09 - uh
03:10 - h is equal to their centimeter of their
03:12 - height
03:13 - and then h divided by um h
03:16 - is going to equal to h divided by 100
03:19 - which would equal to
03:20 - the meter so centimeter divided by 100
03:23 - equals the meter there we go after that
03:26 - um we're going to
03:27 - get the bmi so
03:30 - b bmi
03:34 - equals to bmi equals to
03:37 - the width which is the weight
03:41 - um weight
03:44 - and then divided by height
03:48 - times where's times here
03:51 - times height and as you can see uh we
03:53 - want high times height first and then
03:55 - weight right
03:56 - but then if we go like this it's going
03:58 - to be a
03:59 - weight divided by height then times
04:01 - height so you won't want that
04:03 - so in order to do that we need to put
04:04 - parentheses as i said earlier orders of
04:07 - operations
04:08 - here we are uh and after this is the
04:11 - output so we print
04:14 - print the b
04:18 - bmi which um whoops
04:22 - print bmi there you go now it gets your
04:24 - bmi
04:25 - so let's pretend um
04:30 - 60 right uh
04:34 - 60 155 and this would be your bmi
04:38 - it's pretty simple guys it's a short
04:41 - video how
04:42 - long is it just four minutes four or
04:44 - five minutes
04:45 - so it's not that much it's pretty simple
04:47 - it's
04:48 - like i'm not sure what a bmi is used for
04:51 - let me just switch it up how about that
04:54 - um
04:57 - okay b what
05:01 - do you need
05:04 - uh what do you why do you need bmi
05:08 - why do you need
05:12 - bmi or what is bmi your bmi is a
05:15 - measurement that is a
05:16 - that is a ratio of your weight and
05:18 - height it's a good way to gauge whether
05:21 - your
05:21 - weight is in a healthy proportion to
05:23 - your health in fact
05:25 - knowing your bmi can help you and your
05:27 - gp determine any health risk
05:29 - so it's for your health basically guys
05:32 - um
05:33 - if you know your bmi you rather know
05:34 - you're fat
05:36 - you're skinny or you're good as you can
05:38 - see is in healthy proportion to your
05:39 - height
05:40 - so whether you're healthy or not and any
05:42 - like um
05:44 - risks you might have so look
05:47 - another question what is a bad
05:50 - bmi if your bmi is under
05:55 - 80 18.5 k
05:58 - um kilograms you are considered
06:00 - underweight and possibly
06:03 - malnourished which means that you aren't
06:05 - um
06:06 - fed well enough and this one
06:10 - 18.5 to 24.9 kilograms
06:13 - you're within healthy weight of range
06:15 - for your
06:16 - for young and in middle and the 25 to
06:20 - 29 kilograms you're considered
06:23 - overweight
06:24 - okay so yeah uh that's bmi so now since
06:28 - we know what it's used for
06:29 - um i think we can like use that for a
06:31 - bunch of other stuff
06:33 - so if you want to like see whether your
06:35 - health in good shape or
06:36 - um and you fatten up or like go on a
06:39 - diet then you just calculate your bmi
06:42 - and then
06:42 - uh look in this website or something and
06:45 - then you'll see
06:46 - whether you're in good shape or you're
06:49 - a little overweight so yeah see you next
06:52 - video of
06:52 - python bye for now
