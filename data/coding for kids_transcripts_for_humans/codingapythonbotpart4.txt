With timestamps:

00:00 - hello everybody my name is Jimmy and
00:01 - today I will be showing you part four of
00:04 - our python bot today we're going to be
00:05 - doing some image recognition as well as
00:08 - some other things and we're actually
00:09 - going to be starting our uh bot tracking
00:12 - ability today and recognition ability as
00:14 - well so yeah let's go ahead and get
00:15 - right into it first things first let's
00:17 - go ahead and open vs code so visual
00:21 - Studios Visual Studio like that open it
00:24 - up okay and then this is our old code
00:27 - let's just contrl n to create a new one
00:28 - close this up uh just press just press
00:32 - save all right and we're going contr s
00:34 - this one as well and we're going to go
00:35 - inside our python bot in here py Autobot
00:39 - no wait no
00:41 - teaching
00:44 - uh yeah I'm just going to go into here
00:47 - I'm just save it I guess it's going to
00:49 - be
00:49 - [Music]
00:52 - main.py okay and then now we'll di to
00:55 - see where we
00:56 - are okay we're still outside so let's CD
00:58 - into our folder so I'm I'm going to go
01:00 - grab our folder F our folder really
01:02 - quickly all right so in order to copy
01:04 - the code we just go into our uh where is
01:07 - it
01:08 - coding python right here and just grab
01:12 - this oh python bot and just grab this
01:14 - like so contrl C CD bam enter there you
01:17 - go we are inside of our folder right now
01:20 - which means we can go and activate our
01:22 - virtual envirment so let's go ahead and
01:24 - do that uh I kind of forgot the lines
01:27 - actually it's been quite a while since I
01:28 - recorded the last one
01:30 - so let's what is it python Autobot uh
01:33 - scripts activate Okay python Autobot so
01:37 - python
01:39 - oh python Autobot script activate like
01:43 - so press enter and if there's a green
01:45 - thingy right here that means it's
01:46 - activated and we're good to
01:48 - go all right so now after done this
01:51 - we're going to be importing some uh
01:54 - elements or some libraries that we need
01:56 - in order to let our uh our bot recognize
02:01 - the images so let's go ahead and install
02:03 - them all of our images can be I mean all
02:06 - of the libraries can be found on p.org
02:09 - which is the main uh Storage Point for
02:12 - python packages and yeah let's go ahead
02:14 - and do it so I think it's it's called
02:17 - open
02:18 - CV
02:19 - CV SL
02:22 - python 4.8 let's try it out let's see
02:26 - there you go we can use this one this is
02:28 - the newest version so let's go ahead and
02:29 - do this let's copy right here and then
02:32 - we're going to go into our Visual Studio
02:34 - code we're going to paste it into here
02:36 - press enter and it will install
02:39 - itself just wait a little
02:43 - bit there you go it's almost wait wait
02:45 - until it's done it's not done yet it's
02:47 - still
02:51 - installing there you go now it's
02:53 - done now if we were to do pip list we
02:56 - would also find it pip list like so as
02:58 - you can see we have num
03:00 - uh and then open CV right there okay all
03:03 - right now once we're done with all this
03:05 - importing stuff we can now put it into
03:08 - our code and in order to check that it
03:09 - works we're going to say import CV2
03:11 - which is the library just did uh we just
03:13 - had installed as see CV all right this
03:17 - makes so that when we type we can type
03:19 - it very uh shortly so we don't have to
03:21 - you know type the entire thing is it
03:24 - called just copy open cv.
03:28 - python this work
03:30 - let CV2
03:33 - error no module found
03:36 - CV2 all right maybe it's let's save it
03:39 - again and see if it works because it
03:41 - should have a CV too I don't know why
03:44 - it's not having CV C CSV I don't think
03:47 - it's CSV no let's
03:52 - try
03:54 - CV2 but why can't I no modu found
03:58 - CB2 there must be a fix
04:01 - right okay now find mod CV2 and using
04:03 - open
04:05 - CV uh and try get a f
04:08 - message okay so how do I fix it Konda
04:12 - update Konda PP
04:14 - install okay that's what I did
04:18 - though let's try it
04:22 - out install op
04:24 - TV oh wait am I not in
04:28 - my
04:30 - wa cancel
04:32 - X well it's done but I think it's
04:35 - because I wasn't in my virtual
04:36 - environment so let's try it again let's
04:38 - go into a virtu I don't know why I
04:40 - deactivated yeah I'm outside as you can
04:42 - see I'm outside uh okay well let's try
04:46 - to go back if I were to do pip list
04:49 - right now it should be outside right
04:51 - yeah I'm outside so I'm going to try I'm
04:54 - just going to ignore that and try to go
04:56 - back so CD into our old folder which is
05:00 - python Autobot right here bam and then
05:06 - scripts wait
05:09 - what oh I go python Autobot first python
05:11 - Autobot scripts
05:13 - activate Okay and now it should work
05:17 - save
05:19 - run okay no wait let CS it's still CSV
05:22 - CV2 come on CV2 there must be a
05:27 - CV2 was there no CV2
05:32 - did it work oh it did
05:35 - work yeah there's no okay there's no
05:37 - errors even though it's like a squiggly
05:38 - line I feel like it's fine so let's
05:41 - import numpy now so import numpy or nump
05:45 - as
05:47 - NP as
05:51 - NP all right now let's try running this
05:54 - all right that also works
05:56 - so let's try again just to make sure
05:59 - sure oh no I'm not inside my thing
06:02 - anymore
06:04 - CD CD into this I don't know why it
06:07 - keeps kicking me out
06:09 - CD
06:12 - okay uh python Autobot script SL
06:17 - activate Okay so I'm going to keep it
06:19 - here it seems like it works so I'm fine
06:22 - with that as long as it as long as it's
06:25 - fine I just don't know what these two
06:28 - errors are
06:34 - python um I don't know it's fine okay
06:37 - let's go and now grab an image online to
06:39 - grab to let our uh thingy recognize it
06:43 - so let's go ahead do that I'm just going
06:45 - to grab this
06:47 - okay so our image could be of like I
06:50 - think we're going to have like pieces
06:52 - maybe chest pieces do chest pieces chess
06:55 - nope not not chess.com
06:58 - chess bam
07:00 - images let's go find a chest piece
07:05 - uh this one
07:08 - maybe what else what else can I find I
07:11 - want like chest pie sand out from each
07:13 - other
07:16 - so make sure
07:20 - distinct you know what it's fine I'll
07:23 - just okay let me scroll down for a
07:25 - little
07:25 - bit okay I think I just use this one
07:28 - actually
07:29 - May's
07:32 - fine yeah I think I'll use this one okay
07:36 - there's two might get confused
07:39 - though uh this
07:41 - one it's
07:44 - huge find a good size one yeah this
07:46 - one's actually kind of nicely sized but
07:48 - it has the water mark I don't think that
07:50 - matters though this one oh this one's
07:52 - pretty good um I just grab the king or
07:54 - something all right we'll save this one
07:56 - as like chest
07:58 - piece chest yes oh it's w
08:02 - no seriously all right we'll have to
08:04 - convert it
08:07 - now I I hate when websites make it D
08:10 - like WG because like all it does is just
08:13 - delays our process but doesn't really
08:15 - like it doesn't really do much you can
08:18 - still convert it really easily just it's
08:21 - inconvenient oh my all right we
08:24 - converted it let's download
08:27 - this all right and let's download save
08:31 - Jazz chess.
08:35 - jpg okay let's go to our
08:39 - downloads okay close this no wait that's
08:43 - not the one okay you're kidding me
08:45 - saving M
08:47 - jazz
08:49 - jazz okay now we're going to no I I just
08:52 - opened Val it's fine I just delete this
08:56 - okay
08:58 - um
09:01 - D I'm not restarting am I all right so
09:04 - once we have our thing installed now
09:06 - we're going to put it into our code all
09:08 - right so first things first let's go
09:10 - ahead open our folder I'm going to copy
09:11 - this piece right contr X I'm going to go
09:13 - into our coding python python bot and
09:16 - create a new image I mean folder called
09:18 - image like so paste this inside after
09:20 - that close this up go into a visual
09:22 - studio code and then we're going to say
09:24 - chessor IMG equals to CV do image read
09:29 - or IM red and then we're going to
09:32 - say
09:34 - image IMG
09:37 - SL
09:39 - chess. jpg which is our folder which is
09:42 - our file that we just put in comma STV
09:46 - dot I'm read again underscore any color
09:49 - this will generate us an array which US
09:52 - humans will not understand only robots
09:54 - will which uh which is fine because as
09:57 - long as robot understands then the final
10:00 - product we should understand so we're
10:01 - going to print out just to check yeah
10:03 - there you go the bunch of arrays have
10:04 - appeared and this is what we want but I
10:06 - don't know why it's 255 for all them
10:08 - maybe we uh maybe our folder name
10:11 - doesn't have a JPG wait let me just add
10:12 - it just to be
10:14 - sure okay let's try
10:18 - again uh oh there's none now
10:22 - um okay can't open this anymore just.
10:27 - jpg save try
10:30 - again what uh I think it open through
10:33 - here though no there's the Explorer open
10:37 - folder images uh let's just select
10:40 - folder python Autobot
10:44 - okay
10:45 - okay yes let's open our main okay uh and
10:50 - our images oh it's do jpg twice okay I'm
10:52 - going rename this too just
10:54 - dopg okay there you go I thought it was
10:56 - broken it
10:58 - wasn't
11:00 - can you just
11:02 - like yeah okay there okay that's good
11:05 - all right now once we have this uh we
11:07 - should be
11:11 - okay yeah I think we're fine but let's
11:15 - again I don't know why we have to
11:16 - activate our virtual environment so much
11:18 - it doesn't stay for some reason let's go
11:20 - ahead python Autobot again python
11:22 - Autobot script SL activate all right all
11:25 - right so now once we did this we're
11:26 - going to now find um where we want to
11:30 - locate it so as you can see in our chest
11:31 - piece maybe I want I want the king part
11:33 - right here so I'm going to open up my
11:35 - folder I'm going to go to coding python
11:37 - python bot images grab this chest piece
11:40 - right here and I'm going to crop it out
11:42 - so I'm going to grab the editor tool and
11:44 - I'm going to get the crop okay I'm just
11:46 - going to shink it down to this part
11:49 - right
11:50 - here like so
11:54 - okay and now I'll click save options and
11:57 - I'm going say save as copy
12:00 - uh go back into our coding python python
12:04 - bot images save this as
12:06 - night like so all
12:09 - right it's not a knight it's a king what
12:12 - name is Knight all right King okay once
12:15 - we have a name it should appear here and
12:17 - there you go all right so in we can just
12:19 - copy paste this twice oh chest image
12:23 - change it to something else change it to
12:26 - king.
12:27 - image King
12:29 - _ image and kingore gpg okay uh then we
12:34 - can print King just to make
12:38 - sure
12:40 - okay like so enter invalid syntax
12:46 - python uh
12:50 - python what what
12:55 - syntax what line line
12:57 - one
13:01 - [Music]
13:02 - coding so this is my folder right coding
13:08 - python okay we're going to close it we
13:10 - run it
13:12 - again there you go okay now it works
13:14 - some reason and our virtual environment
13:17 - has been kicked out yet again guys uh
13:22 - oddly so let's go back python script
13:27 - activate now run it okay there there it
13:30 - works but the thing that's bothering me
13:32 - is why is it
13:35 - 255 maybe it doesn't matter I'm not sure
13:37 - but yeah let's let's print
13:43 - type okay now is up higher rate but
13:47 - still I don't I don't know why it's not
13:49 - showing up different numbers it's all
13:51 - like the same
13:53 - color I don't know it's kind of weird to
13:56 - me but maybe I'm just overthinking it a
13:58 - little bit bit anyways let's go ahead
14:01 - and
14:03 - continue all right so now once we've
14:04 - read our images we're going to find them
14:06 - so we're going to go ahead and create
14:07 - some a varable called result equal to
14:11 - cv. match
14:14 - template sorry template match template
14:19 - chessor image comma kingcore image comma
14:26 - cv. TM underscore
14:30 - CCF normed like so and now we're going
14:33 - to do underscore comma Max comma
14:36 - underscore comma Max locate this is
14:39 - going to locate our images equals to
14:43 - cv. min max lock like so uh parentheses
14:49 - result all right so this will locate the
14:52 - image and tell how accurate is let's
14:53 - print out Max and Max lock we'll print
14:56 - out Max lock first I guess contr c
14:57 - control+ v and delete this little part
14:59 - okay print it all right so it has
15:02 - located our
15:03 - picture uh at 87 382 which I'm pretty
15:07 - sure is accurate right 87 is the X so
15:10 - it's around like here and then 382 is
15:13 - really high up so it's around here yeah
15:15 - I think it's pretty good I think it's
15:16 - pretty accurate it has a 99 okay that's
15:19 - basically 100 100% like guarantee so
15:22 - yeah that's pretty
15:24 - good all right so now we're going to
15:27 - have uh it draw a border right here so
15:30 - it going to it's going to show where it
15:32 - found our image so let's go ahead and do
15:33 - that we're going to first off create a
15:35 - threshold this way if our accuracy is
15:38 - below this threshold then we might not
15:39 - show it because it might be an
15:40 - inaccuracy but since our accuracy is
15:42 - pretty high right now I'm going to set
15:43 - it as like 85 just in case and I'm going
15:46 - to say if
15:48 - maxcore uh is greater or equal to the
15:52 - threshold threshold then we're going to
15:55 - say top left which is the starting point
15:58 - of our of our which is where it locates
16:01 - the image equals to Max lock
16:06 - height
16:08 - height equals to
16:10 - Knight king sorry
16:14 - kingore shape zero and then width equals
16:21 - to kingcore image.
16:25 - shape one which is the width and the
16:28 - height
16:29 - the
16:30 - bottom right equals
16:33 - to top
16:36 - left zero that's an O
16:39 - zero uh plus
16:44 - width
16:46 - comma top
16:51 - left and then one right here then comma
16:56 - I mean plus height all right this will
16:58 - basically uh create the brain for the
17:01 - bottom right we're going to cv.
17:03 - rectangle this is going to draw it now
17:05 - rectangle chest doore image comma top
17:09 - left which is starting point uh bottom
17:12 - right ending point and now we're going
17:14 - to set the color I'm going to have it as
17:17 - uh blue so I'm going to do 51 comma
17:20 - 51a 2555 wait this is blue or red I'm
17:23 - not sure maybe let's just search it
17:26 - up uh I'm just going to go search it up
17:28 - right
17:30 - here bam what color is that that's none
17:33 - of the maps
17:34 - no
17:37 - okay it's blue yeah okay we're good so
17:41 - make it blue and I'm going to set the
17:43 - thickness
17:45 - now so I say thickness equals to 4 we
17:50 - going to say line type equals
17:53 - to
17:54 - cv.
17:57 - line line eight let's say in line eight
18:01 - yeah all right now let's create a new
18:04 - line this will show it now so we're
18:07 - going to cv. um
18:09 - show uh result result like
18:13 - so comma chess images
18:18 - tv. weight
18:20 - key uh that's it and then we're going to
18:23 - destroy all windows once we're done so
18:25 - destroy all windows like so now let run
18:29 - it hey there you go that's pretty good
18:31 - as you can see it located our image
18:33 - right here but it's red red is fine it
18:35 - doesn't really matter okay so it's
18:38 - showing us where it found our image
18:40 - which is very accurate to where we
18:42 - actually made it as you can see we got
18:44 - this and got this and it showed us this
18:47 - so that's pretty good that's pretty good
18:48 - and I'll put some text over to make sure
18:50 - we know what it is all right so now
18:53 - let's go ahead and create our um text
18:55 - first off I'm going to comment stuff out
18:57 - so I'm going to say this one show
18:59 - so just to make sure me and the future
19:01 - knows what we're doing this one will
19:04 - draw
19:06 - draw this one will set
19:10 - start uh set how you call it set width
19:16 - and
19:17 - height okay there we go there we go and
19:21 - now before it shows I'm going to put
19:23 - some text so hash
19:26 - text like that and we're going to say
19:29 - font equals to
19:31 - cv. font Hershey
19:35 - Simplex like so
19:39 - position equals to top
19:43 - left wa I'm supposed to top
19:47 - left uh zero I can't really type
19:50 - today um comma top left one like so okay
19:57 - we're going to say fine
19:59 - size equal to 1
20:02 - color equal to 51
20:06 - comma 255 comma 51 like
20:11 - so say cv. putut
20:15 - text chat images comma this be a text
20:20 - I'm going say
20:22 - King
20:24 - comma
20:27 - position uh comma font comma font size
20:31 - comma
20:33 - color comma thickness like so these are
20:36 - all the parameters that we need I'm say
20:37 - this goes to two let's run it there you
20:41 - go okay um it's green let's make it blue
20:45 - I mean make it
20:47 - red do one like that that should be red
20:51 - or no oh wait no it's blue I sorry I
20:54 - meant blue yeah okay it's good but the
20:56 - font sucks
20:58 - so let's change the font really
21:02 - quickly uh maybe this one's bad change
21:05 - it font
21:06 - Hershey Hershey Hershey complex like
21:10 - that okay that's a lot better um okay
21:13 - I'll leave it like that so that's pretty
21:14 - good all right so now if we were to look
21:17 - at this uh as you can see it does not
21:19 - it's not centered completely which it's
21:21 - kind of annoying so I'm going to make it
21:23 - so that it codes up a little bit and
21:24 - goes to the center we can do this by
21:25 - adjusting the position right here the
21:27 - top left top I mean top left top left uh
21:31 - oh I think I did something wrong here uh
21:32 - top
21:33 - left oh wait never mind I I I did it
21:36 - correctly top left one meaning the width
21:38 - all right I mean meaning the height
21:39 - sorry so yeah this is pretty good uh we
21:41 - can adjust the height by adding to here
21:43 - say adding by 25 may be too much let's
21:47 - see that actually lowers it um so
21:50 - subtract subtract
21:53 - 25 okay that's a bit too high I'm going
21:55 - to say
21:57 - 15
21:58 - a bit too high again let say
22:01 - 10 all right and close it
22:06 - 10 uh is it not showing anymore 10 is
22:10 - good I like like 10 okay okay chill
22:13 - chill chill hey okay I understand man
22:16 - chill okay um so we have minus 10 we're
22:20 - going to plus plus let's say 20 20 like
22:25 - so uh it should be in the middle too far
22:28 - I'm going say
22:30 - 15 yeah that's pretty good so yeah as
22:33 - you can see I put in the middle and it
22:35 - looks a lot nicer so yeah this is how to
22:38 - make that simple code contrl s to save
22:40 - this and that's it for this video if you
22:42 - want to recognize more stuff for example
22:44 - like you want to recognize this Knight
22:46 - or this bishop or this queen right here
22:48 - then you just go ahead and take a
22:49 - screenshot or crop it out then adjust
22:53 - the change the name right here and you
22:55 - should be all good so yeah that's
22:57 - basically it and I hope you enjoyed this
22:59 - video and found it useful this is the
23:01 - first the starting part of our bot it
23:03 - will go much more later on so stick
23:05 - around and find out how far it goes
23:07 - anyways see you guys later bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody my name is Jimmy and today I will be showing you part four of our python bot today we're going to be doing some image recognition as well as some other things and we're actually going to be starting our uh bot tracking ability today and recognition ability as well so yeah let's go ahead and get right into it first things first let's go ahead and open vs code so visual Studios Visual Studio like that open it up okay and then this is our old code let's just contrl n to create a new one close this up uh just press just press save all right and we're going contr s this one as well and we're going to go inside our python bot in here py Autobot no wait no teaching uh yeah I'm just going to go into here I'm just save it I guess it's going to be main.py okay and then now we'll di to see where we are okay we're still outside so let's CD into our folder so I'm I'm going to go grab our folder F our folder really quickly all right so in order to copy the code we just go into our uh where is it coding python right here and just grab this oh python bot and just grab this like so contrl C CD bam enter there you go we are inside of our folder right now which means we can go and activate our virtual envirment so let's go ahead and do that uh I kind of forgot the lines actually it's been quite a while since I recorded the last one so let's what is it python Autobot uh scripts activate Okay python Autobot so python oh python Autobot script activate like so press enter and if there's a green thingy right here that means it's activated and we're good to go all right so now after done this we're going to be importing some uh elements or some libraries that we need in order to let our uh our bot recognize the images so let's go ahead and install them all of our images can be I mean all of the libraries can be found on p.org which is the main uh Storage Point for python packages and yeah let's go ahead and do it so I think it's it's called open CV CV SL python 4.8 let's try it out let's see there you go we can use this one this is the newest version so let's go ahead and do this let's copy right here and then we're going to go into our Visual Studio code we're going to paste it into here press enter and it will install itself just wait a little bit there you go it's almost wait wait until it's done it's not done yet it's still installing there you go now it's done now if we were to do pip list we would also find it pip list like so as you can see we have num uh and then open CV right there okay all right now once we're done with all this importing stuff we can now put it into our code and in order to check that it works we're going to say import CV2 which is the library just did uh we just had installed as see CV all right this makes so that when we type we can type it very uh shortly so we don't have to you know type the entire thing is it called just copy open cv. python this work let CV2 error no module found CV2 all right maybe it's let's save it again and see if it works because it should have a CV too I don't know why it's not having CV C CSV I don't think it's CSV no let's try CV2 but why can't I no modu found CB2 there must be a fix right okay now find mod CV2 and using open CV uh and try get a f message okay so how do I fix it Konda update Konda PP install okay that's what I did though let's try it out install op TV oh wait am I not in my wa cancel X well it's done but I think it's because I wasn't in my virtual environment so let's try it again let's go into a virtu I don't know why I deactivated yeah I'm outside as you can see I'm outside uh okay well let's try to go back if I were to do pip list right now it should be outside right yeah I'm outside so I'm going to try I'm just going to ignore that and try to go back so CD into our old folder which is python Autobot right here bam and then scripts wait what oh I go python Autobot first python Autobot scripts activate Okay and now it should work save run okay no wait let CS it's still CSV CV2 come on CV2 there must be a CV2 was there no CV2 did it work oh it did work yeah there's no okay there's no errors even though it's like a squiggly line I feel like it's fine so let's import numpy now so import numpy or nump as NP as NP all right now let's try running this all right that also works so let's try again just to make sure sure oh no I'm not inside my thing anymore CD CD into this I don't know why it keeps kicking me out CD okay uh python Autobot script SL activate Okay so I'm going to keep it here it seems like it works so I'm fine with that as long as it as long as it's fine I just don't know what these two errors are python um I don't know it's fine okay let's go and now grab an image online to grab to let our uh thingy recognize it so let's go ahead do that I'm just going to grab this okay so our image could be of like I think we're going to have like pieces maybe chest pieces do chest pieces chess nope not not chess.com chess bam images let's go find a chest piece uh this one maybe what else what else can I find I want like chest pie sand out from each other so make sure distinct you know what it's fine I'll just okay let me scroll down for a little bit okay I think I just use this one actually May's fine yeah I think I'll use this one okay there's two might get confused though uh this one it's huge find a good size one yeah this one's actually kind of nicely sized but it has the water mark I don't think that matters though this one oh this one's pretty good um I just grab the king or something all right we'll save this one as like chest piece chest yes oh it's w no seriously all right we'll have to convert it now I I hate when websites make it D like WG because like all it does is just delays our process but doesn't really like it doesn't really do much you can still convert it really easily just it's inconvenient oh my all right we converted it let's download this all right and let's download save Jazz chess. jpg okay let's go to our downloads okay close this no wait that's not the one okay you're kidding me saving M jazz jazz okay now we're going to no I I just opened Val it's fine I just delete this okay um D I'm not restarting am I all right so once we have our thing installed now we're going to put it into our code all right so first things first let's go ahead open our folder I'm going to copy this piece right contr X I'm going to go into our coding python python bot and create a new image I mean folder called image like so paste this inside after that close this up go into a visual studio code and then we're going to say chessor IMG equals to CV do image read or IM red and then we're going to say image IMG SL chess. jpg which is our folder which is our file that we just put in comma STV dot I'm read again underscore any color this will generate us an array which US humans will not understand only robots will which uh which is fine because as long as robot understands then the final product we should understand so we're going to print out just to check yeah there you go the bunch of arrays have appeared and this is what we want but I don't know why it's 255 for all them maybe we uh maybe our folder name doesn't have a JPG wait let me just add it just to be sure okay let's try again uh oh there's none now um okay can't open this anymore just. jpg save try again what uh I think it open through here though no there's the Explorer open folder images uh let's just select folder python Autobot okay okay yes let's open our main okay uh and our images oh it's do jpg twice okay I'm going rename this too just dopg okay there you go I thought it was broken it wasn't can you just like yeah okay there okay that's good all right now once we have this uh we should be okay yeah I think we're fine but let's again I don't know why we have to activate our virtual environment so much it doesn't stay for some reason let's go ahead python Autobot again python Autobot script SL activate all right all right so now once we did this we're going to now find um where we want to locate it so as you can see in our chest piece maybe I want I want the king part right here so I'm going to open up my folder I'm going to go to coding python python bot images grab this chest piece right here and I'm going to crop it out so I'm going to grab the editor tool and I'm going to get the crop okay I'm just going to shink it down to this part right here like so okay and now I'll click save options and I'm going say save as copy uh go back into our coding python python bot images save this as night like so all right it's not a knight it's a king what name is Knight all right King okay once we have a name it should appear here and there you go all right so in we can just copy paste this twice oh chest image change it to something else change it to king. image King _ image and kingore gpg okay uh then we can print King just to make sure okay like so enter invalid syntax python uh python what what syntax what line line one coding so this is my folder right coding python okay we're going to close it we run it again there you go okay now it works some reason and our virtual environment has been kicked out yet again guys uh oddly so let's go back python script activate now run it okay there there it works but the thing that's bothering me is why is it 255 maybe it doesn't matter I'm not sure but yeah let's let's print type okay now is up higher rate but still I don't I don't know why it's not showing up different numbers it's all like the same color I don't know it's kind of weird to me but maybe I'm just overthinking it a little bit bit anyways let's go ahead and continue all right so now once we've read our images we're going to find them so we're going to go ahead and create some a varable called result equal to cv. match template sorry template match template chessor image comma kingcore image comma cv. TM underscore CCF normed like so and now we're going to do underscore comma Max comma underscore comma Max locate this is going to locate our images equals to cv. min max lock like so uh parentheses result all right so this will locate the image and tell how accurate is let's print out Max and Max lock we'll print out Max lock first I guess contr c control+ v and delete this little part okay print it all right so it has located our picture uh at 87 382 which I'm pretty sure is accurate right 87 is the X so it's around like here and then 382 is really high up so it's around here yeah I think it's pretty good I think it's pretty accurate it has a 99 okay that's basically 100 100% like guarantee so yeah that's pretty good all right so now we're going to have uh it draw a border right here so it going to it's going to show where it found our image so let's go ahead and do that we're going to first off create a threshold this way if our accuracy is below this threshold then we might not show it because it might be an inaccuracy but since our accuracy is pretty high right now I'm going to set it as like 85 just in case and I'm going to say if maxcore uh is greater or equal to the threshold threshold then we're going to say top left which is the starting point of our of our which is where it locates the image equals to Max lock height height equals to Knight king sorry kingore shape zero and then width equals to kingcore image. shape one which is the width and the height the bottom right equals to top left zero that's an O zero uh plus width comma top left and then one right here then comma I mean plus height all right this will basically uh create the brain for the bottom right we're going to cv. rectangle this is going to draw it now rectangle chest doore image comma top left which is starting point uh bottom right ending point and now we're going to set the color I'm going to have it as uh blue so I'm going to do 51 comma 51a 2555 wait this is blue or red I'm not sure maybe let's just search it up uh I'm just going to go search it up right here bam what color is that that's none of the maps no okay it's blue yeah okay we're good so make it blue and I'm going to set the thickness now so I say thickness equals to 4 we going to say line type equals to cv. line line eight let's say in line eight yeah all right now let's create a new line this will show it now so we're going to cv. um show uh result result like so comma chess images tv. weight key uh that's it and then we're going to destroy all windows once we're done so destroy all windows like so now let run it hey there you go that's pretty good as you can see it located our image right here but it's red red is fine it doesn't really matter okay so it's showing us where it found our image which is very accurate to where we actually made it as you can see we got this and got this and it showed us this so that's pretty good that's pretty good and I'll put some text over to make sure we know what it is all right so now let's go ahead and create our um text first off I'm going to comment stuff out so I'm going to say this one show so just to make sure me and the future knows what we're doing this one will draw draw this one will set start uh set how you call it set width and height okay there we go there we go and now before it shows I'm going to put some text so hash text like that and we're going to say font equals to cv. font Hershey Simplex like so position equals to top left wa I'm supposed to top left uh zero I can't really type today um comma top left one like so okay we're going to say fine size equal to 1 color equal to 51 comma 255 comma 51 like so say cv. putut text chat images comma this be a text I'm going say King comma position uh comma font comma font size comma color comma thickness like so these are all the parameters that we need I'm say this goes to two let's run it there you go okay um it's green let's make it blue I mean make it red do one like that that should be red or no oh wait no it's blue I sorry I meant blue yeah okay it's good but the font sucks so let's change the font really quickly uh maybe this one's bad change it font Hershey Hershey Hershey complex like that okay that's a lot better um okay I'll leave it like that so that's pretty good all right so now if we were to look at this uh as you can see it does not it's not centered completely which it's kind of annoying so I'm going to make it so that it codes up a little bit and goes to the center we can do this by adjusting the position right here the top left top I mean top left top left uh oh I think I did something wrong here uh top left oh wait never mind I I I did it correctly top left one meaning the width all right I mean meaning the height sorry so yeah this is pretty good uh we can adjust the height by adding to here say adding by 25 may be too much let's see that actually lowers it um so subtract subtract 25 okay that's a bit too high I'm going to say 15 a bit too high again let say 10 all right and close it 10 uh is it not showing anymore 10 is good I like like 10 okay okay chill chill chill hey okay I understand man chill okay um so we have minus 10 we're going to plus plus let's say 20 20 like so uh it should be in the middle too far I'm going say 15 yeah that's pretty good so yeah as you can see I put in the middle and it looks a lot nicer so yeah this is how to make that simple code contrl s to save this and that's it for this video if you want to recognize more stuff for example like you want to recognize this Knight or this bishop or this queen right here then you just go ahead and take a screenshot or crop it out then adjust the change the name right here and you should be all good so yeah that's basically it and I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful this is the first the starting part of our bot it will go much more later on so stick around and find out how far it goes anyways see you guys later bye
