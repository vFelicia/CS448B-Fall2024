skills you should develop your college time the very first is i would say public speaking and in this also i'll include uh english speaking or i would say you should work on your communication skills see it's very important to develop these skills at least public speaking skills you have to get rid of your public speaking phobia that stage phobia if you have and it is a great time you will not get time after the college if you are maybe many students are like you know very shy in nature they hesitate they think that they think that others will laugh if you speak or if you speak in english because your english is not uh so fluent that is why i have combined these two points like public speaking and english speaking if your spoken english is good definitely you will be you will feel much confident you will feel more confident you will feel more confident in speaking in public and see these skills will be required when you are going to sit for campus placement or when you are going to uh you know go for offcampus placement or to get a job these skills are very important and obviously these skills are like public speaking is also important in later in your life also it's not just for the job purpose right so and it's not like that it is just a crash course you can do 10 uh days and 15 days course and your communication skills your public speaking spec skills and your english is so fluent no it takes time it takes time to develop these communication skills it takes time to get rid of your stage phobia that public speaking phobia it takes time to be fluent in english spoken english so it takes time as well as it takes practice that and you have time now during your college years right so please work on these skills what you can do you can just give some presentations in your class you can host any event you can give a speech on any uh function i know many students do what if today it's your turn suppose for uh to give presentation in your class then you bunk that class on that day right but it's your biggest mistake you are doing it's okay if students will laugh and everybody is like you see it it is the right time to get rid of your fear because later you will not get time and it would be really problematic for you in your job so better to develop these skills during your college time second thing is management skills see please don't think that management skills are only for mba this is limited for mba students no these are also required for you also every student for everyone management skills are required it's not like that it is required only to get a job or during your job but it is also very necessary in your life also obviously in your life also you have to manage many things so better to learn management skills in your college time once also only so what you can do there are many events in colleges many festival manifest and every uh thing so you can do what you can just be volunteered you can manage any event or you can host anything you can manage any exhibition or these kind of things see many activities are there in colleges so you can just manage you in a single activity so you will get some experience how to manage things what kind of problems you you can face during this during that management so you will learn something so management skills are also required and you have to develop these in your college days only because it's a great time next is make a habit to maintain a todo list maybe you are thinking we don't need to maintain a todo list because we remember everything what we have to do today but see sometimes you forgot maybe if you have to submit any assignment or maybe if we take example during of your study related then and if you have to submit any synopsis of any project or anything and you forgot and on the same day or maybe one day before you remember like oh i have to do uh this also and maybe at that at last moment you don't get time to do that thing so better to maintain a todo list just what you need to do today and once you complete those tasks you can just yeah i have done this thing so it's like you will be habitual of organizing everything so that would be good see because yeah if you are in college if you forgot something it's okay if you suppose forgot to uh submit any assignment or quiz or any synopsis of project or anything it's okay for this time only but when you will get into that job then you will have to get serious things are things will get serious at that time because they are paying for you for the work and if you forgot something if the deadline you have to submit some work and the deadline is today and you forgot that work to do then it's it is going to harm you it is going to harm your career maybe they can fire you or if they will not fire you then definitely it is going to harm you during your promotion these kind of things so better to make a habit during your college time only to maintain a todo list so that you remember everything yeah i have to do this this this today and next is it is related to this todo list next is try to complete your task immediately or get it early get it done early don't think yeah i have much time tomorrow i'll do this or tomorrow you'll think tomorrow i'll do this and your tomorrow will never come right so suppose you have to submit any assignment and you have time today because suppose assignment date is after 10 days and obviously you have time during your college days you have free time a lot of free time so do it immediately or try to complete that assignment that thing as early as possible do not wait for the deadline it is really going to help help you in your job because there you will have to work under pressure and if at that time you will do calculate a project at that time once the deadline will come nearer you will feel more pressure and you will not able to give your hundred percent so better to get things early if you have time do not avoid things like tomorrow i'll do tomorrow i will do right next is and i think you should develop a hobie or anything which removes stress or by doing that thing you will feel fresh or it will make you physically active so you can play any game like or you can sing a song you can dance you can cook anything which is of your interest like maybe playing games boys prefer playing cricket or playing i would not say playing video games because here i just want to focus on the thing which includes some physical activity or you can do exercise because this thing also very important your health is also very important so you should take care of that also you should make a habit of doing some physical activity at least maybe for 15 minutes or 30 minutes from your college time only because it is the time where you don't care about your health i know everybody because of maybe sleeping habits or eating habits anything but after some time maybe after three years five years seven years you will realize that i should take care of my health and at that time it would be very you know tough for you to make a habit of doing exercise or anything so better to make a habit of doing some exercise some physical activity maybe some playing playing some game which help which you know requires some physical activity during your college time only so please don't put your health aside take care of yourself right so these are in my opinion some common or some must have habits for everyone for every student and you should develop these habits during your college time right so that's it for this video now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
