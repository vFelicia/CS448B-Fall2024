so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing structures in the previous video i have discussed like what is a structure how to declare a structure right and why we need structure that is like introduction part of structure right in this video we'll discuss how to declare variables see structure is what i have told you its a user defined data type if it is a data type then obviously we can declare our variables of that data type like integer data type so if you want to declare a variable if you want to take a variable of type integer then how you will declare just find out the write down in and name of the variable that's it so structure is also a variable like float so float name of the variable character care name of the variable this is how we can declare variables of these data types so structure is also a data type but it is user defined so obviously we can take variables of that data type of structure data type but how you will declare those variables right that will discuss in this video with proper example right and those variables are also known as objects of structure but before proceeding just i just want to write down some example of structures like we have what we have discussed in previous video and you are supposed to tell me these are valid or invalid you can write down the answer in the comment box right if you have watched the previous video then you can easily tell like these structures are valid or invalid these are four examples like one the second third and fourth so you are supposed to tell me this declaration of structure is valid or invalid and if invalid then why it is invalid right now i will discuss how to declare the variables of structure so see here i am going to take the previous one that we have discussed in previous video like struct struct student see struct is keyword student is what tag structure tag and this is like you know optional i'll tell you in detail in this video i have taken three members these are members of the structure problem by marks and name after we are supposed to write down semicolon right now till now no memory has been allocated to this structure because this is just a data type this struct student this completed just a data type so see if i write in main function if you want to take a variable of type integer how you will write in a how much memory would be located four bytes in some compiler two bytes right if you want to you know check out in your compiling your machine how much memory then you can just write on printf in main you can write down printf size of like size of operator sizeof and in bracket int it will give the size of in data type in your system right now if i want to declare a variable of this data type then how you will write first of all data type the name of that variable so the data type here is what struct student this complete is data type it's not like many students do this mistake they simply write struct and they think that this is data type so they only write struct and the name of the variable like suppose i'm thinking s this is wrong this complete is data type stuck student now name of the variable suppose i am taking name of the variable s this is how you can declare the variables of structure or this s is also known as object of this structure using this object only we can access these members how we will access that also discuss in the next video with a proper example proper program right so now at this time the memory has been allocated how much memory to this s to this object to the say how much memory four bytes to this a s how much memory because the data type of this is struct student now stock student is user defined at a time so how much memory you just have to calculate the memory required for these structure members for roll number four bytes because it is integer for marks it is float four bytes for this 20 bytes so how much memory would be allocated 28 bytes to this s if you want to check out simply write down printf size of this structure is what percentage d size of in the bracket you can write down s or you can write down size of struct student the complete word stuck student it will give whatever the size has been allocated how many bytes right so this is how declaration of variable this is one method second method is what what in main you can write down this thing if you don't want to write down this thing then while declaring this structure only while defining this this data type here only you can write down the name of the variable like i am taking one variable s so no need to write down here in the main means this s is what variable of data type struct student or you can say this is object of the structure this is second way but we generally recommend like we generally write down this method stop student and s we define we take the variables in main function by writing this thing rather than writing here right so now if you want to take two or three variables of this type here only you can write down s1 s2 suppose two variables i want to take s1 s2 3 s1 s2 s3 that's it if you want to take 60 students like information of 60 students i want to store it's not like that you will take s 1 s 2 s 3 up to s 60 60 variables no that is not a good idea so i will take array array of these structure variable that is also possible so that also will discuss this concept also we will discuss for this video i guess it is clearly you to clear to you like how to declare variables of this structure and this student one more point is what very important point is what this student this structure the tag of the structure or the name of the structure is structure is optional so you can just remove this thing and this is also fine here also now if you write down this we have declared two object of structure s1 and s2 right so you can omit this thing but the drawback of this point is what i hope in some students got it here because at some point of time in our program i want to take more variables right anywhere so now it is not possible to take to declare variables of this data type in the main function anywhere in the program why because we don't have that tag while writing we write struct keyword then the tag structure tag and then the object name or the variable name but here we haven't written any structure tag or the name of the structure so that is why it is not possible to declare variable by this method if you write down this thing if you declare if you define the structure data type by writing this thing if you omit this structure tag right so that is a drawback fine that is why we write here stuck like name of that structure like as you can see tag of the structure and now you can write down here like struct student and i want to take a variable more s3 that is fine s1 is 2 here ok s3 three objects are we have created three variables we have created right now see if this is the case uh suppose i am taking here only like s1 comma s2 so now for this s1 object separate this memory would be allocated for s2 separate memory would be located for s1 how much memory for roll number 4 bytes 4 marks four bytes four name 20 bytes same for s2 4 bytes 4 bytes 20 bytes 28 byte for s1 28 by 4 s2 this is the case right even more variable then three for three variables separate memory would be located for s1 thus for s2 same for s3 28 bytes right so i guess the different different methods of declaring the variables are clear to you now so that's it for this video now in the next video we will see how we are going to initialize these objects how we are going to rationalize this structure see if you want to initialize this variable a what you will write is equal to any value integer value like 5 this is what compile time initialization if you want to initialize that runtime then just write take those printf and scanner but how you will initialize this s1 and s2 these are also variables of this struct student data type so how you will initialize these variables right and in that video also you will get how to access the members of the structure right how we are going to access if you want to store some value for s1 student like roll number one i want to store so if you write down here one that is incorrect because at this point of time no memory has been allocated to this data type so we cannot store any value if memory has not been allocated how you can store any value in this variable right so this would be wrong so now how you can store the values here and how you can access that information right that will see in the next video so now i'll see in the next video till then bye bye take care you
