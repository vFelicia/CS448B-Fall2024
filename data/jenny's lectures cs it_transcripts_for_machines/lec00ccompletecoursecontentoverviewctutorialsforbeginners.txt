hello everyone i hope you all are safe and doing good so now let me just tell you one thing the which subject i'm going to start now c plus plus we have completed c so now i'm going to start c plus plus right because see yeah i have asked from you guys also through a poll with subjective start and to be honest first preface was java then python then c plus plus third number was c plus plus yeah i know java is one of the top or maybe you can say the topmost programming language which is in demand in industries i know very well but see i thought that i have completed c recently so it would be easy for you guys to grab c plus plus concept easily right so i think i should start and in our curriculum also in colleges like for c then c plus plus then java comes so maybe i would follow this order c then c plus plus then java and it would be easy for me also to complete it c plus plus you know as fast as possible so i you know i apologize to those who was waiting for java course but the good news is i am apparently i'm preparing java classes right after you know you will get familiar with c plus once you have completed like basics of c plus plus and you are able to written some programs in c plus plus then parallely we can start java also i'm preparing those because the thing is i want to complete these courses you know like i have completed c uh programming course in detail from basic i want to you know complete this course maybe any course c plus plus or java in a way that even if you don't know abcd of programming you can easily grab the concept you can easily understand what i'm teaching here right it's not like that uber rupert says so i want to you know go in deep like i have completed c uh course from basic from scratch each and every point i have tried my best to complete in that course that thing i want so for this thing you know for java to complete this kind of lectures for java uh programming language i need some time right that is why i'm preparing parallelly java classes maybe after some time we can start parallely c plus plus and java but right now i'm going to start c plus plus and i will try my best to complete it in detail i'll keep it as a beginner friendly course like if you don't know anything abcd of coding then you can easily grab the concept right so now what i'm going to cover in this i'll just give you an overview not in detail i'm going to tell you or just give you the overview what we are going to cover in this course right let's see so this is what we are going to cover the main main topics i have written over there firstly we will see the basics right like see as you know c plus plus is object oriented programming language not purely but yeah it is why so because it follows the object oriented programming those uh concept abstraction polymorphism encapsulation classes and objects these concepts so what is this op object oriented programming and how it is different from like procedural oriented programming or functional programming that basic will see and how it is different from c language right then we'll see the one c plus plus program we will write simple program just to print out maybe in every language first program we generally write is hello world to print hello world so maybe that program will print or any simple program you can uh take so you'll see the structure of that c plus plus program right then the basic things like what is data type variables keywords identifiers as we have discussed in c language also every language obviously is having its own keywords and these things so we'll be seeing that thing then operators then we will see control structure like fl's and loops with the help of program each and every concept will see the help of programs then functions especially what is in line function right and overloading yes the new concept and say like what is function overloading what is inline function that will see after that comes to the oops concept classes and objects maybe you will see you know overview of these concept classes and objects inheritance encapsulation abstraction polymorphism in first class then we will see in detail like in classes and objects also in detail with the help of programs what are access specifier and all we will see how to create a class how to create objects how to access the members or the you know class club members of these classes with the help of object everything we'll see and i'll try to relate these things with them with real life examples i'll try my best then constructor destructor types of constructor default constructor parameterized constructor how to write a constructor what is copy constructor will see all these things and as well as constructor overloading what is use of constructors then inheritance types of inheritance with their programs and polymorphism friend function friend class pointers virtual function virtual class we'll see then concept comes of file management then you know exception handling which is not in c after that templates what is stl standard template library because of this let's see we know that c plus plus is fast way faster than python and then java also because of templates we can use templates to write down code so that would be one reason why c plus plus is fast i'll i'll discuss all the reason why c plus plus is fast we'll see properties of c plus plus also when we'll discuss the basics of uh you know this thing right then still standard template library this is i think one of the best feature in c plus plus tender template library uh because those who you know do competitive programming they know how to use this and what is the use of standard template library so we'll see about this this is what standard template library and see as we know that versions of c plus plus programming right i think recent is c plus 20 and 23 will be coming in 23 stable releases c plus plus 20 c plus plus 11 was one in this version lambda expression they have added so we'll see those thing also that updated thing that modified thing or the newly added thing which have been added in the newer versions right but the basics in every version is same obviously so what new features they have added we will also see that thing like lambda expression anonymous function we know that now function without name that our lambda expression and c plus plus 14 what what functions what i know new things they have added there c plus plus and 17 then 20 so in every version we will discuss the history also i'll you know discuss the c plus history so i'll try to complete i'll try to keep it beginner friendly right as simple as possible with real life example i'll explain with programs practical also we'll see now which id i'm going to use that is vs code there are many ids you can use it's not like that vs code you have to use code blocks is there and dave c plus plus is there netbeans eclipse you can write cps program in eclipse also vs code is also there many ids are there but i will i know uh use this id and how to install this how to set up the compiler how to install the compiler because this is just an id to write down the programs we need a compiler to compile those programs and run so separately we need to install that compiler we need to set up something right so that also we can see in next video so and if you know like how to install this or maybe you can be ready with install everything like vs code and compiler and set up the path variable environment variable and all right or maybe we can discuss this thing in next video right so with the theory it's very important like you have to do practice also i'll try to give a practice problem in every lecture after every lecture and we'll see the solution also in next lecture i'll try my best to do this thing to implement this thing in this course right some quizzes i'll give some questions also we'll discuss right for every concept some complex question basics question moderate questions on every concept we are going to discuss with solution some programs also so i'll try my best to keep this course simple also i'll try my best to cover basics to advanced level concept right from scratch in simple language i'll try this thing right so get ready with all your weapons for this battle right so that's it for this video now and i'll see the next video till then bye take care
