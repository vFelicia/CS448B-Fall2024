so in the series of learning c plus programming language we are discussing control structures in c plus plus till now we have discussed if and if else statements the third one is else if ladder what is the cell shift letter why we use this in which scenario in which condition we use lc flatter in your program how to use this in your program the tricky things what we can do with this lc threader everything about this control structure about the statement we'll be discussing in this video with the help of a program as well as we'll explain first of all with i'll explain this with help of a real life example like the scenario first of all we'll see that thing and then practically with the help of program i'll show you how to use lc flatter in your program now before proceeding let me just first tell you something important many students ask me this question like mom how to prepare for gate exam like we are preparing for gay 23 exams so specifically for paper one because they are very well about their core subject but what about paper one the slabs and the books and you know from where to practice previous year question paper this thing plays vital role in your gate preparation the previous year question papers so i just found a good book it was from oswal books for general aptitude so this is the book we have from oswal books let me just show you the content what you will get in this book first of all some information about gate then question paper for verbal aptitude year wise question paper you will get and then answers with explanation then quantitative aptitude and analytical aptitude and then in class two sample paper also question paper and with that answer with their explanation you will get right so some information about gate we do not know what is gate then you can see here why is there a legibility criteria for every stream and if you are attempting first time gates and then some tips to crack the exam in first attempt right exam pattern also given how to calculate the scope the syllabus you will get in this book first of all and then see the cut off marks also you can see for you know for the year 20 21 and 22 last three years for every paper you you can see trend analysis this is also very important right now they have given some mind maps also mind my basically you know make your learning simple for every topic you will get mind map like for error sporting divisibility rules reading comprehension for every topic you they have given these mind maps so you can go through these mind maps then mnemonics they have given right and this is the mnemonics they have given basically you know simple tricks to memorize something complex for every topic and then you will get the question paper right for 2022 verbal aptitude first of all this is the answers and at first you have question paper stream wise questions right and then answers and then answer with explanation you will get the explanation is also very good ear wise from so here you will get ear wise from 10 to 21 verbal aptitude list of question you will get branch wise according to stream you will get here right the question computer science and after that the list of question and after that you will get answers answer key and then the explanation you will get answer with explanation right last you will get sample paper two sample papers i guess you can go for this book so the link from where you can buy i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is lc flatter okay now if you have multiple choices see till now we have discussed if you are one choice then we can use if statement if you have two choices like coffee in starbucks and ccd then you can use defense statements if you have multiple choices then like if you are going to a supermarket same your mother asked you to buy a vegetable like ladyfinger you ask if not available then what to buy potato if potato is not available then what to buy maybe your mother will say capsicum if you say capsicum is not available maybe your mother will say like brinjal so you have multiple choices now right if any of this is available you can buy that if nothing is available then just come to home so same if you have multiple choices in your program you want to implement your multiple choices then have to implement that scenario in your program with help programming using else if statement else if letter we say this right now see what a general syntax of writing elsif letter c simply first of all obviously you write if then we write some condition like condition one you can say right then this if block or i'm just writing maybe like statement statement one right then else again if make sure there is space between else and if because else is keyboard and if it if is another keyword there are different keywords right now we put condition two one one more condition suppose condition two and here i am writing statement two right only one statement i am writing that's why i am not putting any curly braces else if condition one more condition suppose condition three and if it is true then statement three like this you can put else if lc percent till means uh you how many choices you have or the condition you have those number of else if you can put right and after that simply n and suppose a statement i am writing statement here x right after this after this if else else if letter we have a statement abc right so as soon as a condition is true the corresponding statement to that if would be executed and the remaining condition the remaining statement would be skipped then directly control will go to statement abc whatever statements you have written after this else if letter right suppose this condition is true control will enter here statement one would be executed and all the other conditions would be skipped directly control will go to now statement abc suppose this condition is false then control will go to this will check this condition if this condition is also false then control will go to this condition condition three suppose this condition is true then control will enter here here in this block statement three would be executed and whatever condition you have written after this till this else would be skipped and after that directly control will go to statement abc let me just show you this with the help of flowchart suppose this is first condition condition one so two cases can be there if this is true then corresponding i have written statement 1 so this would be executed right and if this is not true then if this is false then next condition would be checked condition 2 if this condition is true then statement two would be executed and if this is false next condition condition three would be checked like this condition three would be checked right same two if this is condition 2 is true statement c would be executed like this and so on and if this is false then again suppose we have condition condition 4 5 those would be good right at last suppose we have condition n right here we have suppose uh at last we have condition till condition n how many condition you have it depends on you condition n if this condition is true then corresponding to this suppose we have a block statement n right like this and if this is false this is last condition then whatever you have written in this else statement x i have written that would be executed so now we have statement x statement x or you can say default statement whatever you have written in the last else that would be executed and finally after statement 1 also 2 also 3 also this n and statement x what would be executed i have it and here statement abc this would be executed right like this and after that you can say exit from the program so this is something you can say like flowchart of elsif ladder fine now let me just just try this with the help of program let me just show you on my laptop so let's take the same example if you have money greater than thousand then simply i am writing only you will have coffee in starbucks right else if you have money greater than suppose 5000 then you will have coffee in ccd right else if you don't have money greater than uh 500 but you have greater than 100 then you can have like coffee normal shop right if you don't have money greater than 100 else you can have p i'm sure you have 20 rupees you both can have t 20 or 30 rupees right okay that's the that's the case otherwise at last after that after that you will put let's go home that's it if suppose we enter a money suppose i'm entering money 500 or i'm and entering me 300 first of all this condition is this condition true no skip this check next condition this condition true no check next next condition money greater than 100 discussion yes this is true now control will enter here what would be printed coffee in normal shop and after that directly no else would be executed after that directly out of this elsif letter whatever statement you have written after this let's go home this is like statement abc so let's go home would be printed right so here you have multiple choices you can have coffin starbucks cd in normal shop you can have tea so these if you have no multiple choices multiple path decision you want to take then we use elsita now alternative of the sensitive letter is what you can do the same thing if you have multiple choices and you want to select one then you can implement that thing with lc trader or you can implement this with switch statement one more control structure we have switch statement right same program you can do with this so that thing will discuss the next video now let me just show you this thing practically on my laptop so this is the program we have same we have written this header file using namespace st then main we're taking a variable money then just entering how much you have using seen we are entering the money money now i have here four i think five choices i have implemented five choices in this program if money is greater than equal to thousand then it will print simply money i have and let's have coffee in starbucks else if money is greater than 700 you can have coffee in ccd if money greater than 500 you can have coffee in a normal shop if money if money is greater than 100 let's buy sachet and make coffee at home you can buy sashi and you can make coffee at home else let's have tea if you don't have money even hundred rupees you don't have i think at least you have 20 to 30 rupees so let's have then let's go home right let me just run this program and show you the output you will get c okay let's run this again see how much you have it is asking so suppose i'm entering 1200 i have so let's money i have 1200 let's have coffee in starbucks and directly let's go home first condition is true only for first condition is true 1200 greater than thousand so let's have coffee in starbucks the remaining condition remaining statement would be skipped directly whatever you have written out of this elsif letter let's go home that would be printed that would be executed now let's run this again now i have money suppose 400 so let's buy sachet and make coffee at home and let's go home now first condition is not true second condition 700 not true third condition 500 greater than 500 not true fourth condition is true money greater than 100 yes so control will enter into this let's buy sachet make coffee at home that would be printed 10 directly let's go home right if i run this again suppose i have money 30 rupees let's have t and let's go right same you can if like i put semicolon in after this if same it will give error else in the cells because this else is will be previous it will give like else without previous if right so else without previous if you can't put semicolon here right yeah you can put semicolon in this else that is fine it will not give any error but now you have terminated this else so this statement see out let's have t would also be a part of means would be a would not be a part of this lcd letter anymore would be considered as part of the program like c out let's go home let's have t these two statements would be you can say out of the sales letter so this is your assignment i have put semicolon after this else now suppose i am entering money 700 700 what output you will get you have to tell me in comment section so i hope you got the scenario of lc flatter why we use and how to use this thing so now in the next video we will see switch statement as well as nested if one is also left that is necessary that also in the next video so nice in the next video till then bye bye take care
