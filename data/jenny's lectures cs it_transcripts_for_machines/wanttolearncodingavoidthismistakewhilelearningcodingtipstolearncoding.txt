if you want to learn coding or if you have just started learning coding you are beginner in coding then you must avoid some mistakes that generally students do see what happens with some students at starting they were interested in learning coding but after some time they started losing interest they think that after some time they think that coding is not for them coding is not their cup of tea they can't do coding right so what mistakes they do while learning and ultimately they'll end up with coding is not for me so you have to avoid those mistakes that one of the biggest mistake we are going to discuss in this video and how to avoid that mistake that also we'll discuss and it's okay if you are not interested in coding there are some other skills also that you can learn and you can go in those fields also see its digital era everybody is learning some digital skills whether it's you know a machine learning you know cyber security cloud computing or digital marketing and you can

box of this video you can go and check out one of the biggest mistakes generally students do want to learn coding they totally depend on college to learn coding what they think in the first year in the first semester they have c then c plus plus in java and they learn all the programming languages in college only that is the biggest mistake you do please don't no depend don't be fully totally dependent on your college to learn programming yeah you will learn coding there you will learn the c language c plus plus but only the basics it's not like that after completing your first year you are you are very you know expert in c programming you can write down any program you can write down any logic in c programming then in c plus plus after second year then in java no yeah you can learn basics or maybe you know to some advanced level to intermediate level but not up to that level for that what you have to do you have to try out your own you have to analyze yourself you have to focus on yourself you have to put extra time extra efforts to learn programming to learn coding right sometimes even your basics will not be cleared by the college and that's true see i'm not saying that college faculties are not good they're not teaching very good yeah i'm getting many comments also like my college faculty is not good they are not teaching very well we are getting your lecture but that's not true they are also teaching very well maybe their teaching style is different and you are not getting that teaching style see in a class we have 50 to 60 students right maybe in first year you have 60 students and obviously some students are good because maybe they have in 11th and 12th they have programming or they they have learned c language they have they had computer so they are good in programming or maybe they are putting extra efforts because sources are available at home only before attending the class they are they are you know attending they are watching videos from youtube and getting that concept to some what i am not saying that they are learning that concept properly but obviously they are learning something before going to the class so now when they they go to the class they have knowledge of that concept and once the faculty will teach they'll get that concept properly right that can also be a case and maybe you haven't studied that concept you think that you you totally dependent on your college faculty la i'll i'll go to the class this first of all this chapter or maybe like they're going to start adding they'll teach and i'll get everything in the class only no that is not a case that will not going to happen in case of programming languages you have to put extra efforts also you have to put extra you have to give extra time to learn programming right so in a class of 50 to 60 students maybe some students are good maybe some students are you know very good catcher maybe some students are they haven't they don't know even abcd of programming and they are not good catcher right they need time it's not like that in that 50minute lecture whatever the faculty will teach you will get everything even no one will get everything right what they will do they'll study before the class they'll study after the class also and if you will not do that thing then obviously you will not get anything and if your basics are not clear suppose one concept is is done like arrays are done so obviously faculty will move to the next concept but you haven't get this this concept right you are that kind of students you know who who take extra time to learn the concepts you need more practice you need more time but obviously faculty is not going to take more time for those college faculties it's just a course and they have to complete it within that deadline within the three months or four months yeah that's true that's the harsh reality they have to complete it for that for those it's just a course and for you you have to learn this programming language before going to c plus otherwise if you not get c the same thing will happen in c plus plus you will not get this language also once your base foundation is strong you will get any language easily right so the extra time you need to put yourself faculty is not going to give you extra time right so it's not like that they are not they are not teaching very well yeah maybe their teaching style is different what you have to do you have to search for resources and resources are available many good resources are available many youtube videos tutorials are available you have to you know start watching those video tutorials from first from the starting right you can google any if you have any question you can google it stack overflow is there documentation is there many good websites are there to follow those websites some good you you know youtube video tutorial or some documentation you have to try out your own you have to put extra efforts you have to practice at your own because obviously in class then teach theory only or if you have practical in lab also and we know the environment of college no one is you know very much it's like interested or you can say you know aware at that time even students are not aware at that time they'll just time pass in the labs right few students are there who genuinely do the programs and practice more and more programs and that's the students and those are the students those are the students who learn coding and what you will think you were attending the same lab you are attending the same you know class the same faculty were teaching you but you are not getting you are not good at programming and that student is good for you you know good at programming and you think that coding is not you know for you it's not your cup of tea but that's that's not true maybe you were interested at starting at starting you were interested but you are that kind of person who need more time so that more time you have to give yourself the faculty will not give you that extra time right and once you will not get the concept like arrays but yeah you got arrays but not up to that level and what you think okay fine let's move to structure let's move to then union then pointers but still something is left you will not get arrays properly not the structure part or not the union concept not the pointer concept not the file handling concept and you know this kind of thing happens you don't ask the you don't ask questions you don't practice yourself now ultimately you will lose interest in programming right and at last you will think it's not my kind of thing it's not my cup of tea i'm not good at programming i'm not interested but at starting you are interested if someone is there to teach you properly each and every concept then maybe at last you were good and you know you would be interested in programming so for this thing you have to find out your own resources from starting only you have to find out your own resources youtube videos some websites good websites and try out those things right don't just totally dependent on college to learn coding and after learning something some concept start writing simple simple programs then some complicated type of program then start working on a project or a simple website right these are also available on social media or you can say on youtube many videos are available on youtube once in starting if you are able to write down some programs like obviously in starting you will write hello world program then maybe addition of two numbers subtraction number is even old factorial these kind of programs then ultimately you will gain interest right and after completing a simple project even if the project is very simple now you will feel you know very much confident in this programming and your interest will be at this level right and if your interest is there in programming if you are interested to learn programming languages or if you are interested to learn coding then no one can stop you it all depends on your interest and don't just totally be dependent on the college to learn coding so now i'll see the next video till then bye take care
