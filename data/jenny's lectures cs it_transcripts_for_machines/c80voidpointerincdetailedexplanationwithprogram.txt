so in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing pointers in C in pointers also there are some special pointers like word pointer generic pointer null pointer dangling pointer and these pointers are also very helpful right so we are going to discuss these pointers one by one in this video I'll discuss void pointer everything about void pointer like what is void pointer the need of void pointer why we use void pointer how to declare this pointer how to use this pointer right with the help of a program right and I'll show you that program also on my laptop practical also we'll see right everything we'll discuss about this pointer in this video and one by one by one in later videos you will discuss dangling pointer null pointer all the these special pointers we'll discuss right so you'll also see how this pointer is different from the other pointers we have discussed like integer pointer character pointer float pointer everything about this pointer we will discuss in this video every single detail right so now let's discuss what is void pointer I hope you know the meaning of this void in general term in English term like K or empty right so it's like if there's a glass and that is empty that is void you can fill that glass with maybe water with some other drink or with milk anything you can you know put in that glass right so apply the same concept here also try to relate that thing void pointer means this pointer is of void type means this pointer is having no Associated data type if you will see the definition it that maybe on internet or in any book then you must you must uh see that word pointer is what it is not having any Associated data type that is in simple terms that is a the same example you can take an empty glass you can fill that glass with either you know with water or with milk or with some other drink or anything right so same this pointer is having no Associated data type with it so you can convert this pointer in any other pointer also now whatever I am saying what's the meaning of that thing see first of all if I write a pointer something like this int star P one is float star FP here I'm writing IP or here I'm writing CP it means there are three pointers this is integer pointer see data type of pointer is not integer it means IP is a pointer which is pointing to a int data type or maybe this is storing an address of a variable whose data type is integer or simply we call it as in integer pointer or pointer to integer this is float pointer or you can say a pointer to float this is pointer to character right so they they are having their Associated data type the data type of this is the data type which is associated with this pointer is int with this float with this care but word pointer is having no Associated data type so how to declare this pointer see the synx is same obviously if it is a pointer you have to use EST this will tell that it is a pointer name here you will write pointer name suppose I'm writing pointer name word pointer that is WEP so what you will write here at the place of this data type simply we will write what this void this keyword void so this this is what a declaration of void pointer right I hope you understand what is void pointer it is it it is not having any Associated data type right so you can convert it into any other data type you can type cast it right here it means this can store address of a variable like if a address variable is in a another variable I'm taking float B one variable I'm taking care C so this pointer can store IP is equal to address of a only this is possible this can store address of a only if you write IP is equal to address of B this would be wrong and what if we can write FP is equal to address of B and this pointer CP is equal to address of C right but here this pointer can store address of this int variable also float variable also care variable also right so it's like a generic pointer same in Empty Glass we can fill maybe water some other drink or maybe milk anything we can typ cast it so we can typ cast this pointer for that you have to typ cast this pointer directly if you write suppose here I'm writing VP is equal to address of a it means now this word pointer is storing address of this variable a and suppose in a I'm having a is equal to 5 but if you will print like print F percentage D and whatever in a I want to print in a I have five and this WEP this pointer this is pointer this is pointing to a suppose address is th000 so in VP we have address of a that is 1,000 so if you want to access this using this wordid pointer what you will write D reference you will D reference this pointer I hope you know this because we have discussed these Concepts I know uh in our previous videos of pointers right it means estri VP value at this address here we have th so so it should give five but it is wrong you cannot dreference aoid pointer it will give you error first of all you have to typ cast it because see when you deference then it will see suppose I'm D referencing this IP I'm writing here IP IP is equal to address of a suppose this is not VP this is IP this pointer right and EST IP so it will give you five this is correct because this is integer pointer this is not word pointer so now when you dreference it it means compiler now know add the data type of this pointer the associated data type with this pointer is integer means now compiler know in modern compiler obviously it depends on machine to machine but I take like in modern compiler integer take four bytes so now compiler know 1 2 3 4 suppose in memory within these four bytes this a the value has been stored five converted into binary form like 32 bits and then this five has been stored here and address of first bite is 1,000 then 1,1 1, and2 1, and3 something like this right so now value at this address address is th000 address is th000 so now from here we want to access now Associated data type is integer so when you apply D referencing now the compiler know that he has to access four bytes 1 2 34 because data type is integer that is why the data type is needed when you dreference that pointer right so now it will access four bytes and it will give you value same if you access D reference this character pointer character will take one bite so now compiler know by seeing this data type compiler will know that he has to access only one by because dat type is character right same float if float is there means four bytes so it has to access four bytes but here we are using suppose VP now word is what it is not a data type now how compiler will know that it has to access one byte or 4 byte or how many bytes compiler doesn't know so how to access this void pointer how to dreference this void pointer how to get the value right value may be within one by or value may be in four bytes don't know it is void pointer right that is why we we cannot dreference this word pointer I hope you got the reason why you cannot dreference this word pointer right if not then you can ask me in comment box maybe in maybe in another video I can tell you the process in a separate video right so now that is why it will give error so first of all we will have to typ cast this one typ cast means now I'm storing in VP address of a so here we have VP I'm storing address of a and data type of this is what integer so we have to typ cast it into integer pointer so now how to type cast it here rather than using this what you will write int estri VP so first this word pointer would be typ casted or you can say converted into an integer pointer and now we apply this D referencing operator right now it will give you what value five because now now we have converted into int or we you can say typ casted into integer pointer so now compiler know if int then it has to access four bytes so data would be in four bytes so starting by is this so it will access 1,00,000 1,2,3 till 103 4 bytes and obviously this is integer type and this would be stored in four bytes only so definitely you will get five right now if I write if I write something like this VP is equal to address of CP uh sorry address of uh C I'm storing VP this address variable is what character type right so here in C suppose I'm storing character is uh zero yeah 0 is character it's not like that AB BCD is only character whatever you will write in single code that will be in character A Single Character you can write so if you write zero here so zero would be considered as a character right so now address of C now VP is suppose here we have this is C here we have zero obviously in that form like in uh Zer and one form that would be stored right and now VP this is a pointer and this is pointing to here suppose address is 2,000 so it we are storing 2000 now now how to print how to print this is character we know this is character so we'll use percentage C estri first type cast type cast into a character pointer so we'll write here care s and now name is VP that's it first of all it will be typ casted into character pointer and then we'll der reference it so D reference means value at this point value is what zero so it will give zero I hope you got this and if you write here VP is equal to address of float variable so before printing type cast into float and that it will print floating value suppose in B I have 1.11 so it will print 1.11 right so simple point about word pointer there is nothing much about word pointer it is not having an data type you can convert it into any other pointer or you can typ cast it into any other pointer right so now what's the use maybe you think that rather than typ casting obviously ultimately we have to typ cast it so rather than this directly use an INT pointer and directly deference that pointer what's the use of using this void pointer so here if in the same program same program if I'm using this int also float also so care also so we have to declare three pointers one is for INT one is for float one is for character but if you use this word pointer no need to declare these pointers you can access all these three values using single pointer word pointer only a single pointer how I know I I I hope you know the answer first store the address of a type card it and print then assign in this address of B while printing type cast it then assign address of C while printing type cast it and you can print you can access all the three values three values of different different data types so here we are using only one pointer we are using only one pointer and we are accessing values of three you can say data types integer also float also car also one more thing when we use Melo and kello we'll also discuss these things these are builtin function for dynamic memory allocation so they return what void pointer right when they assign they return memory like they return word pointer to that memory so in that memory we can store any uh value like integer also float also character also right so there also these void pointers would be used right in Malo and kog so that also discuss when we discuss dynamic memory location these are Advanced you know Concepts and see right so that is why we use I guess uh word pointer you you are clear with what is word pointer why we use word pointer like and you can say what's the need of word pointer now let me show you know practically we'll write down some code and we'll see use of word pointer right so now let me create a file here I'm taking name void pointer do c right and I'm taking only one pointer like void estri VP right and I'm taking in a is equal to 5 and one more thing that is float suppose I'm taking float B is equal to 1.56 and care care C at H is equal to uh anything you can take like I'm taking C right and now I'll access all the three variables using one pointer only so I'm first of all I'm writing VP is equal to address of a and now I want to dreference this a is equal to we are printing value of a and see if you der reference like this s will be simple so it will give you error let me run this here we it is giving error like d referencing word pointer and invalid use of word expression so we cannot this deference this word pointer something like this now we have to type cast it so I'm typ casting it into integer pointer first and see now let me run this and it will print a is equal to 5 see see it is printing the value a is equal to 5 right now I want to access that variable float so in VP I'm storing address of B now so now this word pointer is pointing what float variable so now B value is equal to percentage F and here I'm D referencing this now so we have to convert it into float we have to type cast it into float see let me run this and it will give you a equal to uh sorry this a is equal 5 b is equal to 1.5 6 right and now same address of CH and let me print C = to percentage C and uh estri we now we have to type cast into care right and now let me print this sorry run this see it is printing a b c uh CH value all the three values so we are accessing all the three data types variables with a single pointer only so that is benefit of using word pointer that is why programmers use this word pointer right
