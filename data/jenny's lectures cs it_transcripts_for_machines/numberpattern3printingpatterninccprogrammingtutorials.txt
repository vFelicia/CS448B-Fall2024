in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs in c so in this video i will talk about how to print this pattern we will see the logic first of all this on this whiteboard then i'll show you the output on my laptop right now what is the first thing identify the number of rows and number of columns how many number of rows you want to print here 5 and which loop is responsible the outer loop generally we take i the name of the variable is i i 1 here i value is 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 right these are for number of rows and these are number of columns j j is equal to 1 this for 2 then 3 then 4 then 5. now let's see how to write down the logic here first the outer loop that is i is equal to 1 and i less than equal to 5 that's it because it is to print number of lines number of lines should be 5 whenever i value becomes 6 just stop so i should be less than equal to 5 that's it now inner loop j now j is equal to 1 and here what should be the condition j less than equal to 1 see when i value is 1 j should be executed only one time here two time three times four time and five time changing it's changing right so when i value is 1 j is executing only once i value is 2 j is executing 2 2 times when i is 3 j is executing 3 times here 4 times 5 times so i hope you are able to relate i and j right so i can put what j less than equal to i whatever the value of phi j should be repeated that time only right j less than equal to i and j plus plus now here what we will print c now here obviously it is some integer value so percentage d now what i'll print here i cannot print i if you print i we have discussed in the previous video what output you will get one two two three three four four four like this if you write down here j then what output you will get one one two one two three one two three four both the patterns we have discussed neither i am nor j we can print so what hair i can print let's take another variable named number any number sorry variable name is number or abc or anything you can take y z right and i am initializing here obviously in the program i'm not writing here the complete program i'll show the complete program on my laptop well i should initialize i j and what a variable number and number i'm initializing with 1 because i am going to start i am going to print the value from 1 if here 0 1 2 3 4 5 like this then we can initialize it with 0 right but here i am printing from one so number should be printed here but at first number is one so one would be printed now next time two should be printed now three then four then five then six means what her number should be incremented by one after printing number should be incremented because next time incremented value should be printed so here after printing you can just write down number plus plus or you can write down plus plus number same thing here right and that's it for the inner loop now in outer loop what slash and that's it now see the working i value is 1 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition true we will enter into this loop now j value is 1 1 and i value is 1 so 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition tree we will enter here number will be printed whatever the number number is one right so one would be printed on your computer screen right now number plus plus right now number becomes here c when the program would be done then in memory number would be there that is the value is 1 right now number plus plus now this value becomes 2 number plus plus right now j plus plus j becomes 2 is 2 less than equal to i 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is not true exit from this inner loop slash n so control will be in the next line now i plus plus is this condition true 2 less than equal to 5 yes we will again enter into this loop j will be initialized with 1 again now 1 and i value is not 2 1 is less than equal to 2 yes condition 2 will again enter here and number will be printed now the value of number is 2 so now 2 would be printed here right and again number plus plus so now number becomes 3 now j plus plus j becomes 2 2 less than equal to 2 yes condition 2 will again enter into this loop number will be printed now number is 3 so 3 would be printed now again number plus plus number becomes 4 now again j plus plus j is 3 is 3 less than equal to 2 no exit from this loop now slasher means control will be here i plus plus now i becomes 3 now condition is still true and this process would be repeated again until the outer loop the this condition is false right so now i hope uh you got how to print this pattern right now let me show you this output on my computer screen so now let me create another file named pattern 6.3 right and i'm going to copy the previous code because it's almost same we have to what change a little bit so no need to write down it is it's you can say uh saving of our time number of rows okay fine in the loop would be say my less than equal to j less than equal to i j plus plus now what you will print here we are printing what a number here you can say number or any variable name you can take right and let me just declare number because we cannot directly use any variable you have to declare and what the what the value is number is equal to 1 i'm initializing with 1 right and let's do number plus plus or you can do a plus plus number here both are same and that's it now let me run this see enter number of rows 5 and that's it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and like this now if you run this again for 7 rows or 10 rows whatever number you want to print you can enter suppose i am writing here seven rows so you are getting seven rows so now i hope you got how to print this pattern now i'll see you in the next video with a new pattern till then bye take care
