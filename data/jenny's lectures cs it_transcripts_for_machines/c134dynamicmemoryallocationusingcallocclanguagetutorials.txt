so in the series of running c programming we are discussing dynamic memory allocation c in the previous video we have discussed how to use malloc function to dynamically locate memory in this video we'll see how to allocate memory dynamically using catalog function so in this video we'll see all the points about catalog function like what is gallop function the syntax how to use it we will see a program also right i will show you that program on my laptop practically also i will see and will also see the difference between malloc function and calc function right all the points all the detail about calor function will discuss in this video but before there just won't tell you one thing an academy is going to conduct a combat on 13th of march at 11 am it is a scholarship test to maximize your gate and esc preparation it is live test and you can take this test for free here you will get a chance to compete with thousands of learners from all over india and stand a chance to win up to 100 percent scholarship 20 questions you will get and time unit would be 60 minutes and these questions has been created by their best gate and esc educators and after every competition video solution will be given to you by their expert so that you can identify your weak areas and you can improve according to that you can get it right next time and for gate aspirants they also started few batches from 9th of march in this course their top educator will be covering all the subjects of cs and id and in this course you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with the detailed explanation of all the concepts and you can get your doubt cleared in a separate doubt clearing sessions but this course is paid you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on

this test for free and the syllabus for this test is general aptitude and engineering mathematics and here also you will get a chance to win up to 100 scholarship and they also started an academy lite test series for gate and esc the first test would be on 13th of march but subscription of this test series would be paid the price detail and all the other detail of this test series you can see on my screen so the relevant links and detail i'll put in this in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's see what is called function first thing it is used to allocate memory dynamically and the full form of this is contiguous allocations it is a builtin function right which is declared in which ah heterophile std lib don't edge mellow create look all these functions uh which are used for dynamically allocated memory and delocate memory these are declared in this stdlib these are built in function the full form of this is contiguous location full form for mellow function was memory allocation right and it is used to allocate memory dynamically but it allocates memory in multiple blocks and every block is of same size let me just write down this thing so what does this mean dynamically allocate multiple blocks of memory and each block is of same size what kalo sorry malloc does it allocates single block of memory right and it locates it it allocates multiple blocks and each block is of same size right now how this is different from malloc the syntax is it except two argument and malloc takes only one argument right so two argument callo and one argument is this one and second one is size malloc only take this argument the size but it takes two arguments n means size t means uh nothing but its unsigned end means it will take either value either zero or positive no negative value right so n means number of blocks or number of elements you want to store number of blocks you want to you know you want that it should allocate in the from which memory from heap right dynamically from which memory uh section the memory would be located from heap section n means number of blocks second one means size of each block so suppose i want to allocate five blocks right five blocks and i want to store five in teaser so five blocks and and see the return type of this is void pointer same as mallow right why so why word pointer that we have discussed clearly in the previous video when we were discussing malloc function you can watch out that video first right so this is the syntax right suppose i am writing here yellow 5 comma size of int right and in last week a semicolon right means we need five blocks and of integer type so each block size is four bytes or maybe in some compiler it's in some machine it take two byte intake two byte and in some it takes four bytes right so i am taking here four bytes so it will allocate means from the heap section it will allocate one two three four five five blocks and each block is of size four bytes this is also four four four four means you can store here five integer right and it it will return what if successfully it has a located memory it will return base address of this block or you can say the address of the first byte or the first block means base address suppose base address is 1 0 4 2 so it will return this address the address of the first byte of this these blocks right so it will return the base address but it will return an address in the form of void pointer right so according to our needs which type of value we will store here either its integer or float or character or anything according to that you are supposed to type cast that pointer suppose here i want to store into value so just type cast it into int pointer and the address whatever it will return just store it into obviously we need a pointer to store the address so suppose i am taking a pointer hint star ptr so in ptr i am going to store that address that's it so this is how dynamically you can look at my using kellogg and this is c this is what install ptr this is not dynamic memory allocation this is what static memory allocation right i hope you got this because we have discussed this when you are discussing the basics of dma the very first video of dynamic memory allocation right so this is what static memory allocation but this is how we are allocating memory dynamically using yellow right in same if you want to use mallocs you will use hair mallow and five and into size of it right same will type cast this and we can store this in ptr so it will allocate same it will allocate what one block of 10 bytes and it will allocate five block of each of size four by four by four by sorry five into four twenty bytes twenty bytes right and same you you will you can store five in these are here also right so the only difference is uh the full form of malloc is memory allocation configuration location second thing is it will allocate multiple blocks of memory each block is of same size it will allocate a single block third difference is what now it will whatever the memory it has allocated the memory would be initialized with zero by default zero all the blocks would be initialized with zero and in this case it will initialize the these blocks with any garbage value so this is another difference right so this is you can say it's a you know extra thing calloc will do initialization with a zero extra overhead you can say obviously initialization uh process also will take some fraction of seconds obviously it will take so it's extra overhead so if you want that the memory should be initialized with the zero then only use catalog function to dynamically locate memory right because this is this is extra overhead right and it will definitely to some point it will affect the program efficiency right to some point only and this allocation this initialization doesn't matter to you right if you don't want to initialize this with a zero if garbage values are fine with you then you can use mellow only right to dynamically allocate memory so this is i guess these are the points about catalog so i hope the difference is also clear to you between carlock and malloc function right now let's just write down a simple program with callout function over here also i'll take the same example that we have discussed in previous video when we were discussing uh what about malloc function so rather than writing this example here because that would be same let me just show you directly the practical of uh to you know how to use this cat up function right on my laptop see this was a program for malloc function so let me just copy this and create a new file kellogg.c right and let me just paste it so here we are taking in pointer n and i rather than mellow we'll use callout to allocate the memory so the syntax is n this number of blocks you want your number of elements you want to store comma the size of the block which type of block you want which type of value you want to store here i am taking int i want to store integer right so you take size of intel your float you can take character you can take it's up to you right now we will ask from the user for entering the value using a for loop and after that we will print the values right i hope now this is clear to you because we have discussed this program very clearly in the last video so now let me just run this and show you what output you will get and how memory would be allocated right and if you will not initialize you will not enter the values then it will print 0 for all the blocks right now it is asking inter total total values so 3 value i want to store enter the values four three five so the entered values are four three five next time if you want to store five values you can just enter five values and according to five values the memory would be located according to ten values the memory would be located this is the advantage of you can say dynamic memory allocation now let's just do one thing i don't want to take the value from the user right without initializing by default the located memory block would be initialized with zero i have told you using calor so let me just show you practical of this thing see now it will ask the number of blocks you want to enter so here see i have just commented out these points the one for loop in which you are entering the value right and we have only one for loop for printing the entered values right this we have only so it is asking enter total number of values so 3 enter so we haven't initialized anything so the entered values are 0 0 0 if the same thing you will do with malloc then there is value it will print any garbage value see i'll show you rather than hair cal okay look i'm using mellow so and into size of wind right and we are not going to initialize we will just print this is the only difference right now let's just run this again and show you what value you will get either garbage value or any other thing see enter number values 3 and see you are getting any garbage three values right so i hope now the difference between caloric and malloc is clear to you and you can use catalog function to you know allocate some memory or allocate memory dynamically in your program right now one more assignment for you is first of all you need to store five values right integer value right using callout function then you are supposed to free that memory again you are supposed to enter five float values or you can say 10 float values so again you will use now at this time you will use malloc function right and again at last you will free the memory right two time first time five number integer number using hello then free the memory you have to free the memory then ten float values using mellow and then you are supposed to free the memory right this is the program you have to write this is assignment for you right so i hope now that's it for this video so i hope now callout function is clear to you now the assignment for you is you're supposed to write down the difference between catalog and malloc function right so in the next video we will see about real functions soon i'll see in the next video till then bye take
