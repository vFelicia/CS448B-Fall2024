hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language in the previous video we have seen what are Ned loops and when and why to use n Loops So based on that we will see one coding exercise in this video right so what you have to do is you have to write down a program to calculate sum of product of all the pairs of this aray elements this is one array having 10 1 3 4 7 5 these elements you have to find out first the pair all the pair of these elements and then sum of the product of all the pairs this thing you have to do if you got this problem statement then you can pause the video and try this out right now but if not then it's okay let me explain a little bit further the main problem here is how to find out the pair of AR element for that you will need two Loops right and then you have to do the product of the pair and then sum of product of all the pairs right but before explaining this concept here I just want to tell you something if you guys are preparing for gate 2024 exam then I have an exciting news for you guys an academy is conducting all India mock test for gate 2024 aspir and when the date is on 17th and 24th of December plus the main thing is what you can enroll for this test freely you don't need to pay anything for this right just enter your mobile number enroll for free and you have to enter you will get an OTP and that's it right now what is so special about this test first thing you will get a chance to win up to 100% scholarship yes the top rankers will get up to 100% scholarship on two month subscription and it is a all India live mock test so now you have a chance to compete with all the gate aspirants from all over the country right so you will get your all India ranking as well and you will get to know where you are standing among the other irance among the other Learners and this test has been curated by their top educator so here you will get you know the full syllabus based on the latest pattern and you will get an actual exam like experience and this experience will definitely help you when you will you're going to sit in the actual uh you know gate exam so now it's time to test your preparation for gate 2024 right so the enrollment link as well as the other relevant information about this test I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out right now let's discuss how to find out the pair of Arrow elements so you have to find out the pairs of these AR elements pairs means this 10 pair of this 10 with one something like this next pair is 10 with 3 then 10 4 then 10 7 and then 10 5 right it's not like that you have now for one next element is one now find out pair of one so it's not like that 1 and 10 is a pair no this and this these both are same right so this is not a pair the pair is 1 3 1 4 1 7 and 1 5 now for three How many pairs 3 1 3 10 no because we have already 10 1 1 and 3 so if you write down 3 1 that is same as 1 3 so no duplicate pair now 3 4 3 3 4 3 7 and 3 5 same for 4 7 4 5 and then 75 these are all the pairs for these array elements right first you have to find out these pairs then you have to do the product like 10 into 1 is 10 then plus 10 into 3 is 30 then plus 10 into 4 is 40 like this product and then sum of all the products so the main thing is to find out these pairs how you will find out these pairs this thing we will do with nested Loops you have to use nested Loop because if you find out the pair for 10 then 10 then 1 3 4 75 then for 1 3 4 7 5 like this so like index is 0 1 2 3 or let me just take a different color pen so index is 0 1 2 3 4 4 5 so first exess the element 10 which is at zero index then pair it with the element at next index that is one then same 10 will pair with next element that is three till end of the array right when you take this when you access this element one then pair it with next element only not the previous one next element so two Loops you will need one is I one is J right so in I we have these these values 10 10 10 10 and in J we have like 1 3 4 7 5 like this now this is I this is J here we have I is three this is j i is same but J is changing for this iteration also right so how you will do that I hope now you got the basic idea of doing this program it's not so much time right now pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this let's create a new file coding sicise and first obviously you have to include that iio stream header then we have to use we have to use that namespace STD and now in main function let's start doing coding right okay so this array we have the name of the array is data you have to find out the total so let's take a variable total and initialize it with zero now as we have discussed we need a for Loop first so in I is equal to a index should be start starts from zero so let's initialize this with with zero because you have to access these elements of the array so at zero index we have 10 so in I is equal to this and I should be less than 6 the length of that and I ++ right now to find out the pair now I zero so at first we have 10 now you have to find out the pair of this 10 so 10 1 10 3 10 4 10 7 and 10 5 so we'll start finding pair from the next element 10 1 the first pair would be something like this 10 and one the next element from this 10 so the inner for Loop inner for Loop would be initialized from whatever the I + one with the next element and J should be less than same six and j++ right okay now we have this now you have to find out the total right so total we are going to update this total with product of all the pairs so you have to find out you have to fetch whatever the data at first I index then we'll do into the data at ZF index because this this is I this 10 is at I this one is at J now at first right and then that product would be added to this total so Plus equal to this right now after these two for Loops out of these two for Loops you have to print what whatever the total is right and for successful completion return zero let's run this there is one error here okay you have to put here semicolon actually for so long I've been working in in Python so I generally forget to put the semicolon see the total is 142 so you can just find out the pair right and if you do product of all the pair you will get it 142 right I hope you got this the working of this thing if you're not getting this working you just uh write down this this code on a piece of paper and dry in this right then you will get it okay or let me dry this for you for one or two iteration let's see so this is the program the main logic right if you have got this how this is working you can just stop watching this video right no need to watch further but if you haven't got let me just dry this for you so we have this array and we have an element we have a uh sorry variable total at first Total is zero now in I here we have one more variable in this for Loop that is I I at first is zero this condition true yes so we'll enter here now we have another element let's take here J J is I + 1 so I is zero so J would be 1 that's exactly we want right why let me show you now condition true 1 is less than 6 okay we will enter here now total plus equal to what we'll do this is total is equal to Total plus this thing so data of I now I is zero so data of zero means at zero index we have 10 so at first 10 would be accessed into Data of J data of J J is now one so one at one we have one so into one that is 10 now this would be added to total now total becomes 10 right and this is what we want first pair was 10 and 1 that is y j is I + 1 right now after this Loop we have j++ we are still in Outer Loop j++ means J becomes two condition true now data of I would be same that is 10 because I is same for all the iteration of this J now right now I is 10 but J is now two so at two we have three = to 3 that is 30 now 30 would be added to this total and it becomes 40 I hope now you are getting now you can do this thing right same for J like 3 4 4 and five so J is here we have 3 4 5 right once J becomes six exit from this and now I becomes one now for the same J would be repeated again now J becomes at first I is one so Z becomes at first J becomes two so I is 1 J is 2 like 1 3 this is the pair that is exactly you want 1 3 not 1 10 right that is why we have taken we have initialized this J with I + 1 right I hope you got the working of this program right and at last we'll P total right now that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next till the byebye take care
