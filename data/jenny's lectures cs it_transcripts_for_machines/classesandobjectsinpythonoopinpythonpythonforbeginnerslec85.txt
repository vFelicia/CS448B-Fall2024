hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing object oriented programming in Python previous video was about like that was introduction to oop what is an op and why we need oop that we have discussed in previous video because there are some drawbacks in the procedure oriented programming approach pop approach that is why we we are using oop right and to sum what we have discussed like what is a class and what is an object in the previous video so please watch out that video first and then come to this video then you will get in better right now more about classes and objects we will be discussing in this video and how to create your own class the syntax of creative class and object why basically we need a class that thing we'll discuss in this video right so if you remember the previous video then we have come to this thing like we have taken an example of a YouTube channel right so how you can simplify the relationship and how you can you can you know reduce the complexity of a larger project with the help of this Paradigm with help of this approach and that is object oriented programming in the previous video we have concluded that like the pop approach is not able to handle real world project we cannot model real world project or real world problems using pop approach pop approach cannot handle large project very large project you know that is why at Industries in companies The Coop approach is being used while implementing the projects right so now we are creating like a virtual YouTube channel right so like I was the manager and I have instructor I have had instructor then I have editor and social media marketer to handle their respective job right now I have hired like two instructor Jenny and gr to teach different different subjects right so these were objects and the instructor was class so it was just a blueprint to create objects right right so we know like object oriented programming is used to model real world problems Real World objects right so every object is having some information and will do something like I am an object so I'll have some information like name phone number address and I'll do something maybe I'm teaching right so what an object have that we can model with the help of attributes and or you can say variables and what I do or what an object do that we can model with help of functions or methods in programming using oop approach right here like and stuff that is having this thing this information name address and has book has camera has laptop and all and what the instruction instructor will do teach and prepare quiz so these are methods or functions see we do we don't call these simple variables and functions we call these attributes and methods why so because these are associated these are attached with the instructor like name is equal to Jenny address I have some address so these name and address are attached to me these are not free floating variables so these are attributes that is why we call these attributes and the functions like I teach I prepare quiz these are also attached to me if I am an object right so that is why they are known as methods not just simple functions that are free floating in your program no right that is why these are known as attributes and methods right now see everything in Python is an object in the previous video I have you know given you one example also simply if I write X is equal to 1 and if I print type of this x then what you will get class ends so this x is an object of Class end the class is inbuilt class if I want to find out like x in x I am having hello so this is the string so in this at this time it will give class as Str so this is string this hello or this x is an object of class Str same with function in the previous video I have shown you this thing practically right so we have inbuilt classes in Python and we use the object so objects are more important everything we do with the help of objects right because this x is an option X1 this is an object if you create a function that is also an object right so objects are very important we do everything with the help of objects in our python Python Programming right then if objects are important then why we need classes right let's take let's understand this thing with the help of this example see suppose like you have an idli maker right so this is an idli maker and you put that better or that stuff here in this early maker and your idli will be ready in next maybe I don't know the recipe proper maybe 10 to 15 minutes within 10 to 15 minutes right so the idli you are having these are actual objects and the idli maker what you have that is just a design to make to prepare idlis right and if you don't have this design then I think it would not be easy for you to prepare idli maybe you can prepare with the help of some other method I don't know but if you have the steadily maker then it is very easy for you guys to prepare many idlis just in just you know few maybe hours or few minutes right so this idli maker is going to make your thing to make your you know process of making idli is very smooth and simple and quick right so it is a design same if you relate this thing with like of example so class is just a design or blueprint so obviously to create object to create idli we need idli maker so we need a class to create object we need a class that is why classes are important same like if you have any car it may be greater so there are like suppose one million krata in India right I don't know the number but this I'm just supposing this thing so there is a model there there is a prototype there is a design of that car crater and using that design they are creating multiple craters in less amount of time so that design is important that blueprint is important same like third example we can take like a map of a house or a sketch of a house right using that sketch we can create house houses many houses so that house you create a object the real thing that is an object and that map is just a class or a blueprint but using that blueprint you can create multiple house multiple houses many houses right and if you don't have that map then definitely you can build or you can construct a house but if you have map then it would be easy and you know simple to build a house to construct a house because there are many people working there and one who know like what is the map exact planning like what to do next then he or she can easily guide the contractor or anyone he can he or she can easily Guide to the members what to do next if you don't have map then it would be not that much easy to communicate so relationship would be tough right so now I hope you got the idea of class and object and why we need class class is also important right so we can say this class is just a blueprint or a design to create object an object or you can say instance we can also say object is an instance of that class or instance of a class right or we can say class is a user defined data type user defined type why I'm saying so because see when you take X is equal to 1 the type of X is end when I say x is equal to hello then the type of this is it is of class Str it is of Class end so these classes are inbuilt classes right like in test year or many classes we have Boolean also we have float double right so if you want a variable something like this so the type of this is already defined like int but if I want like uh if like Jenny an instructor so this would be of I like this is not any type like I'm not providing it as a string but Jenny is like an object it is having some information like me as an actual person real person some information I'm having some task I do right so for this we have to Define our own type right so that we can Define with the help of like class keyword and whatever class name you give right so class simply we can say it is a user defined data type also okay this thing class is a user user defined a type that you will get it at the end of this video don't worry if you are not getting this right so syntax of creating a class how to create your own class just class keyword and class name and column and here obviously the data what you want to right here that reviewed and the methods and that also we'll see right the class name is in Pascal case it means the first letter of each word is capital letter like class the name n like our name so J is capital K is capital like this so we use this uh like no you can say the what I should say this I'm not I'm not getting the exact word it's okay so this is you can say some kind of rule you have to use a pascal case to write down a class name like for for creating variable name we simply use like underscore like maybe I don't know like user underscore name if a variable then we use underscore this is a first is what first is letter is small and for each other words the first letter is capital this is the only difference between Pascal and camel keys right so this is how you write class class or if you write like something like this first is small there is also small that also will be fine it will not give you any error but that is some kind of you know rule or you can say this kind of thing right just to differentiate between a class name a function name or a variable name something like this right so like this we write class name fine this is the syntax simple and here you will write whatever you want to like attribute methods and all that also we'll see now how to create object if from this if suppose class name is instructor if I want to create object of this class then maybe I am like writing instructor underscore 1 is equal to just the object name then class name last name is instructor but this is not it this you need to pass the these brackets down brackets so this is somewhat like Constructor now what is Constructor that also we'll see but this is simple syntax of creating an object let's see this practically okay so let's create a new file op Concepts classes dot p y so how to create your own class just class keyword and class name so I am creating a class instructor so chemical sorry Pascal Pascal cases first is capital and if the next if you want to write them like information i n f o info then I would be again Capital so this is Pascal case every letter of the word would be Capital so just instructor and then column right now okay I'm not passing anything in class no attribute no method so maybe you think this is an empty class right and I want to create object of this class so instructor 1 the name of the object is instructor one and then equal to the name of the class instructor and just these brackets but see now can you see this red line here so this is an error like this indent expected so same with function I think you have seen if you create function then you cannot you know leave that function empty you have to write down something but I'm not I don't want like I I don't know how what to write in this class right now I don't know the syntax how to write attribute and methods so I have told you one statement we have passed so that you can select just write down here pass so maybe further I'll do something here but right now I don't know what to do here so just write down their path so now see there is no error right so this is how you can create your class and this is how you can create an object so if you run this then there would be no errand but no output you will yet obviously now if you want to find out the type of this object type of the object instructor one because name of the object is instructor one right this is the name of the object we have created so what would be the type of this object let's run this see the type is class is just focus on the class instructor right although we have underscore underscore main underscore underscore so that this thing I'll be talking in later videos right but now you have to focus only on this name instructor right so now we have created our own type our own data type that is why I have told you that line like class is a user defined data type as now as many object as we want we can create from this class from this time instructor One Two Three or many objects many instructors right but all would be of this type class instructor so this is a user defined data type that actually acts as a blueprint to create objects right and object is just an instance of a class right now one assignment for you is you have to create a class and the class name would be car design car design this will be the name of the class right and you have to create two object of that class right so this is your assignment you can write them that thing in comment section so now I hope you got what is a class what is an object what is objective programming how to create your class how to create an object right if you are not getting this if you are still getting like 50 then it's fine not slowly you will get everything in later videos right now in the next video we will see like how to add attribute to your class and there is a method like init that also we will see in next video like underscore underscore unit underscore underscore then in bracket self so what is this method that we will see in next video what is Constructor and this kind of concept right so I'll see you now in the next video till never bye take
