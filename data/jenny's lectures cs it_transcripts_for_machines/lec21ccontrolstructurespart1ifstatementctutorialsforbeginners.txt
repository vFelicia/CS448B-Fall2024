so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language in the previous video we have discussed operator precedence and associativity we have discussed all the type of operators and then operator precedence and associativity with two or three examples with the help of program i have shown you everything about residence and associativity right how to apply precedence and responsibility and when to use these things we have discussed this thing now in this video from this video i'm going to start control structures in c plus first the basic what is control structure why we use it different types of control structure and then in detail we will discuss one by one right so basically there are three basic type of control structure sequential selection and iteration right sequential means as the name suggests whatever statements you have written in you have written in the program the statement would be executed one line by line right in a sequence whenever they appear they execute like the control will start you know execution from the main if suppose i write a program to uh print sum of two numbers right so simply in main we take two numbers like in a b then c out this is simple program to calculate sum of two numbers obviously you can write down that header file using name space std program will start executing from the main function then this line will be executed in a and b then c out enter value of a and b then c and then some would be calculated then some would be printed and return 0 this is a simple sequence so simply we will you can say with the flowchart how you can show enter into the program entry point is main function one by one statement would be executed statement one statement two statement three statement four how many statements are there in a sequence all the statements would be executed line by line and at last exit from the program this is by default control structure of a program by default right next comes to selection control structures now selection means you have to select something based on some condition you have to decide something right you have two choices you have choices right suppose you have choice you have two things kofi or tea now you have choice which one you want to drink coffee or tea if only tea is available you don't have any choice and you will drink tea right you will have tea now you have choice like you have kofi you have tea you have juice different type of juice now you have choices now you have to select right which one you want to have so this is what selection process so you have to decide right same in program also we have choices right how you can implement these kind of choices with help of a program using selection statement so you can say decision making statements right so some statements or a block of statements would be executed based on some condition whether the condition is true or false based on that thing the statements will be executed right and that condition can be any expression or any constant value but the condition should should be evaluated at last either true or false it should be evaluated in a boolean value right so selection uh in selection uh you know control structure we have some you can say some statements or those decision making statements you can say or the selection statement we have if if else and when we have lc flatter ah then we have nested if then we have switch right these are selection statements right so these comes under those selection control statements you consider selection control structure right third comes to iteration iteration right iteration means repeatedly we are executing something based on a condition right again and again we are doing same thing right if you are eating something then we take one bite of the chapati right then we take second bite the condition is till our tummy is full we will eat right then one bite then second bite third bite same task we are repeating again and again we are taking bite like chapati with subject whenever you are full your term is full you will stop and that is the exact condition so means iterative means repeating the same steps again and again right based on some condition right like suppose if you want to print ah value from 1 to 10 right then that would be we do that thing with the help of iterative statements and iterative statements are for loop while loop do while loops simply you can say loops those comes under iterative statements so iterative control structure so basically three types of control statement sequential that is by default till now whatever program we have run i think that is based on that sequential uh execution of the statements right second one is selection that we will execute that we will implement in a program with the help of these statements right next is iterative means loops four while and do one right one by one we'll discuss everything so in this video basically we will discuss about if statement it's not like that f is simple right if write down some condition and then some statement no we can do some tricky things with this if now whatever things whatever tricky questions can be asked based on this if simple if maybe it seems like it is simple one just skip the video but we'll be discussing some tricky questions with help of this if statement that generally they ask in competitive exams or interview or viva and at that time you'll be shocked like i haven't tried this thing with if is it really possible with if or definitely you will give wrong answer so those things those questions those tricky things will be discussing in this video so this video is going to be really important for you guys right so in this video simply will discuss if statement if this is a making statement right with the help of some programs or you can say some examples three or four examples right now see let's take one example you wanna go for a coffee maybe with your girlfriend or boyfriend let's take a simple example right you wanna go for a coffee so the condition is obviously you will see how much money you have saving right so if you have you are two people so if you have more than thousand rupees you can go in starbucks coffee in starbucks obviously that is expensive maybe with coffee you can take some more item also so at least you should have 100 rupees you will see your budget if you don't have thousand rupees then simply what you say let's go home that's it right so how you can implement this thing like i'm taking in main i'm just writing i hope you can write down this header file hash include iostream using namespace std these two things by default right now in money then simply we will enter or you can say how much you have right then c in this is what input output how to take input using c in how to print output using c out right then money now will check condition you check your pocket how much money you have if money greater than thousand then simply see out i am simply printing coffee in starbucks after that i am printing c out let's go home and return 0 right so first of all before explaining this let me just explain this you know general flowchart of general working of if statement right the general syntax is simply you will write if then some condition and then here you will write statements you can write single statements you can write multiple statements if you write single statement simply you can write this thing if you are going to write multiple statements like two statements then you have to put this curly break braces multiple statements you can you have to put these curly brackets this is where you can say block of statements if single statement you are writing this in this if block no need to put this curly bracket right by default this one statement only would be considered as a part of if block right the statement would be after if statement you can say so simply the flowchart can be something like this this is just you can say the entry then we have some condition if condition right if condition is true then we have if statements if you can say if block statement right if condition is false then simply condition is false then whatever after this if lock whatever statements are there those would be executed so that you can say after if block statement right right now this and after that you can say exit so in this case let's see this is the flowchart this is the entry main then me money that money variable would be located located some space in the memory four bytes right then see out it will be printed on the output screen how much you have then seen money suppose you have 500 rupees 500 would be there now check the question money greater than 1000 is this true no you have 500 rupees money is less than 1000 so will not enter into this if block will because the condition is false then after if block condition after if block this is the statement see out let's go home so this would be printed let's go home right if you have you are entering money suppose 1200 rupees you have so the condition is what true now so we'll enter into this if block and what would be printed coffee in starbucks now you can take coke in starbucks you can have right if true the condition is true then if statement block would be executed means this should be printed coffee in starbucks after executing this whatever is written after if look that would also be executed this is the flow then after if law now in this case output output would be kofi in starbucks let's go home these two statements would be printed on the screen right so this is the working of the simple if block now up i'm just writing 100 sorry thousand so if you want to you know change the condition like money is greater than and equal to 1000 then also you can have coffee so that's also you can take this is the condition this condition can be an expression or any constant value but this should be evaluated at last finally in a boolean value either true or false that's it right now okay i hope the simple working is you have understood the simple working of this if blow now let's do some tricky things with this tip sometimes if i put like semicolon here now maybe you think sometimes they have this type of questions after if they put semicolon now maybe you will think this is an error because we cannot put semicolon after this if you will say it is an error no it will not give any error simply program would run through what output you will get c this is what you can say termination of this if block means there is no use of checking the condition now you have just terminated this if condition here so in this case whether the condition is true or false this would be executed the if block as well as the after if block would be executed so if i am here just i am writing i have 500 rupees maybe you think that the condition is not true but still because you are terminating here there is no use of checking the condition still it will print coffee in starbucks let's go home if i write 5 1500 rupees still it will print coffin starbucks let's go home so it is just terminating of the sec block right if i want to check equality condition if money is equal to 1000 then only we will have coffee in starbucks means money is equal to right so sometimes maybe you write money equal to 1000 rupees no in programming language this is what assignment operator if you want to check the equality the equality operator is double equal to now it is fine if money is now thousand money is equal to is equal to thousand obviously condition is true enter into this coffin starbucks let's go home if money is 1200 money equal to equal to thousand no condition is not true so not enter into this block simply print let's go home right if you write this thing money equal to thousand sometimes they ask this type of question also so it is simply assignment operator suppose money i'm entering 12 000 means you are means you you know you will think that this condition is not true because money is 12 000 so simply print let's go home no it is not equality check condition simply it will assign thousand to this money assignment operator is assigned right hand side value to left hand side so now the money becomes here thousand so this is what money is thousand so simply other than zero whatever you write whatever is there in this within this bracket of this if that would be considered as true so this is true it will print kofi in starbucks let's go home so please be careful while you use equal to n double equal to this is assignment operator this is equality check right i hope you got this thing now if i want to print here in if block c out coffin starbucks and it was good these two lines i want that this two lines should be a part of this if block money is greater than equal to thousand so if you don't put these curly bracket then what will happen i am not putting suppose i am putting curly bracket first these two lines in these curly brackets so now money is thousand condition to you we will enter into this if block what would be printed coffee in starbucks it was good let's go home right if i have 100 rupees the condition is not true will not enter this control will not enter into the safe block and what would be printed whatever is there after the block let's go home would be printed only right if you don't put this these brackets right now what would happen if 100 money is 100 condition is not true means you think that output output will be will be let's go home but no what would be the output it was good let's go home why so because we are not putting any curly bracket here so by default only after this if only one statement would be considered as a part of this if block only one statement after this one statement whatever statements are there one two three four that would be considered as part of after if blow that is why condition is not true control will not enter those into this if block means coffin starbucks would not be printed after if block these two would be now the part of after if it was good let's go would be fitted so that's why i was saying if in this if block if you want that multiple statements should be executed after this condition is true then you should put all these conditions into blocks into these braces one two three four five six statements any number of segments you can if only one statement is there then you can skip these curly brackets right i hope now everything about this if is clear to you guys and see if simply you write money that is also fine it's not like that you have to put condition that is also fine but in this case if you will enter money 100 money hundred other than zero whatever is there here that would be considered as true so this statement is true so if block statement would be executed then after it if i enter money 0 now 0 at this time it is false only right so now it will not enter into this if block it will simply print let's go home so this condition can be any constant value if i write any constant like 100 so always it would be true 100 is always true there is no chance of any you know false statement here or false condition here so any constant constant thing you can write an expression you can write but that should be evaluated ultimately into a boolean value either true or false then only this if will work right i hope now the working of this if is clear to you let's uh you know see this thing with the help of practical with the help of a program okay so this is the program see before this program till now we have written program with simply they were following that sequential control structure right no if there is nothing simply one by one line by line program would be executed and in a sequence and we'll get the output right now we simply we are taking a variable into money how much you have seen money and we are checking the condition if money greater than equal to thousand then coffin starbucks and just remove the slime let's go home right now let me just run this simple one first see it will ask how much you have i'm just entering 1200 so coffee in starbucks and let's go home again if i run this and we have only 400 rupees then let's go home no coffee in starbucks this time right if now see let me just terminate this line with a semicolon now what output you get how much you have i have 1900 let's just run this coffin starbucks let's go home okay fine let me just enter now i have 200 only this time condition would be false but still it will print coffee in starbucks let's go home same output why so because we you have just terminated this if log means there is no use of checking the condition here right so this is the thing now if i write like equal to thousand equality check condition equal to equal to right let me just run this and how much you have 200 coffee in starbucks let's go home why so because i we haven't removed the semicolon let me just remove the semicolon let's just run this again see how much you have now i have 200 let's go home right let's run again how much you have thousand of in starbucks let's go home right because this time condition is true if simply rather than double equal to simply i write equal to but this is assignment operator this time right so let's run this program again 200 coffin starbucks let's go home right again 1200 coffee in starbucks let's go home same output again thousand open starbucks let's go home because we are just entering or see suppose i am just entering zero i have zero money still coffee in starbucks let's go home why so because you are just putting assignment operator here it will simply assign the value thousand to money and that would be obviously all the time true other than zero everything every other value would be true so this you need to take care equality check means double equal to now here same condition you can write down like relational operator you can use logical operator logical and if you want to combine two statements right if you want to find out like maximum of two numbers a greater than equal to b and a greater than equal to c maximum is a this kind of thing so you can combine logical and logical or these kind of statements logical not also right relational operators multiple statements multiple conditions you can write down this if it's not like that you can check only one condition right like money i am writing money greater than equal to thousand right and and one more variable i am taking age greater than 15 one more value and one more variable age we are taking and simply see out enterage right we are just entering age that's it right so now yeah we know there is no age bar when you go for a coffee it's somewhere else but let's take simple example i'm just combining two conditions many greater than equal to thousand and eight should be greater than fifteen then only you can have coffee in starbucks otherwise let's go home now let's just run this first it will ask how much you have money yeah money i have 1200 then it will ask age suppose you are entering ages 10 let's go home no fin starbucks logical and means both the condition should be true then only it will be evaluated as true right let's run this again how much you have 1200 age 20 now you can have copy in starbucks let's go home so simply i just want to you know tell you this thing you can combine two three four conditions in this f also logical and logical or operator you can write down so you can try out these combinations also right i hope that's it for this video now so if you have any doubt in this f blog you can ask me in comment section or if you you try out different different things with this if blog it's not like that only one if you can write down in one program no multiple if you can write if this one more if you can write here if condition if condition two three four any number of condition you can write right but rather than writing two three four five these type of ifs if we use if else that is good right like something like this if uh greater than uh greater than thousand rupees you have open starbucks otherwise you can have coffee and ccd that is also fine so we always have some otherwise option alternate option so that how you can implement in program using if else statement so that thing will discuss in next video and i'll see in the next video then bye take care
