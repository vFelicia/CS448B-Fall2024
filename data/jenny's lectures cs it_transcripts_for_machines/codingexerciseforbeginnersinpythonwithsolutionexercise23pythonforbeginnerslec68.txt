hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have discussed about dictionaries in Python right now in this video we will see when coding exercise based on dictionary so I would recommend please watch out that video first then come to this video now what is this coding exercise first thing we have a dictionary right now we have like marks of students in the form of dictionary as you can see on my screen this is a dictionary student Mark and here I am having name of the students and their marks right names are keys and their marks are values key and value pair we are having this dictionary we have so you can note down this thing now what you have to do you have to write down a program that will convert these given marks into grades so basically now you have to make another dictionary whatever name you can take like student underscore grade you can take and in that dictionary name of the students would be as a tease but rather than marks grades would be there you have to convert those marks into grades and what are the criteria if marks are between 91 200 then grade is a plus 81 to 90 a 71 to 80 B plus like this this is the grading system you have to provide below 40 it's F so you can just note down this thing also okay now you have that student marked dictionary you have the grading system now you have to convert you have to just access what marks of the student and you have to put if condition if grade is between this then like grade so like you know marks is greater than 90 so grade is a plus so what you will do the hint is you can take an empty dictionary student grade and in that dictionary you can just put student names and then grade rather than marks I hope now we are getting my point so please laugh pause the video and give it a try so I hope you have tried this out now let's do this exercise together create a new file and you'll see we'll write down coding exercise underscore dictionaries date Dot py okay now just make that same student marks that dictionary okay so now this dictionary we have student marks how how you will do that thing to access these marks using keys we can access so you have to Loop through this dictionary first gen you will access then marks then on marks will put some condition then Harry then marks them on that we'll put some condition so for Loop four student in student marks see this thing we have discussed in previous video if I write down this thing then this student this for Loop if I print student then this for Loop will access all the keys all the keys only right that way that's why I recommend you to watch previous video first so now in student we are having first Jenny then Harry dimpy Rahul aniketh and Prem like this so according to this journey we can access the marks how we can access the marks we are taking a variable marks and how we will access the dictionary name student marks and in bracket just provide the key so first key would be in student this variable right so first time in student in this variable what would be assigned generally now student marks Jenny student marks Jennifer and marks is the student magazine in 92 so 92 would be fetched in this line and in marks now we have 92. now we can put condition on marks so if Mass greater than 90 okay then now what you have to make because you will not change in this dictionary so we will make a second dictionary so let's take an empty dictionary student grade this is what it's an empty dictionary now in student grade we have to put the student name as key and this grade of the student as values right so the name of the dictionary is student grades empty dictionary and in bracket same obviously the name should be same these Keys would be same in both the dictionaries so just same key student whatever the case student and here what you will assign according to this grade is a plus I hope you heard this process see now marks till now marks 92 so check 92 greater than 90 yes condition true condition true means you will enter in this control and student grade this is an empty dictionary in student right now we are having Jenny so the key would be have to add an element that also we have discussed right so Jenny a plus would be added to this student grade first item Jenny a plus key and value pair right like this we will do for all the conditions right second condition is alif marks greater than 80. right in that case same in student grades and student what you will put a right like this I guess you can put all the conditions in else simply f and after that after this for Loop we are going to just print student grade this dictionary right so let's run this and see see Jenny a plus Harry B plus dimpy C Rahul D again A Plus and frame f I hope you got this see no need to put this condition maybe you are confused here you should put marks greater than 80 and less than 90 no need to put these and condition because see if suppose let's take one condition one example marks 82 so first thing first this if condition would be checked 82 greater than 90 no so obviously this will not enter the control will not enter into this if else if second condition is true yes then a would be printed suppose marks 92. first this if condition would be checked 92 greater than 90 yes condition true so in this control we will enter in this block and a plus right so if this condition has been triggered then all the other condition would be skipped so no need to put logical and condition like greater than 80 and less than 90 greater than 70 and less than it is something like this no this one condition is NF now if you are not getting this thing you can just write down this thing uh all the you know code in a piece of paper and write on this thing with different different example different different marks of the students one by one with hand you can write on this and definitely it's not so messed up right so that's it and sorry to frame if anyone who is watching whose name is brain because I give only 34 marks but that is just an example okay okay so I hope you got this exercise this was not so much tough and actually we will see nested dictionaries as well as list so now I'll say the next video till then bye take care
