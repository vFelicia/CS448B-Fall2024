we are discussing functions in python in the previous year we have seen one code exercise how to calculate days in a month with the help of functions right now you have noticed one thing we are using somewhere return statement in a function and somewhere we are simply printing right now what is difference between the Sprint and return when we should use print when we should use return right so that's exactly in this video we'll be discussing what is difference between print and router with the help of example program practically I will show you so we'll figure out all the differences between print and return now print is basically a function that we call right and it will whenever you want to show something to the user you can call Print whatever you will write in this print that will exactly be seen to the user on the screen right some value or maybe any message or anything right but return is a keyword right so return is not going to show some value to the user it is not printing but printing will show some values or maybe any message or anything whatever you want to show to the user you can use whenever you want to show something to the user then you can use print you can call Print function right but it will not show some values or anything to the user it is going to return where to the caller simple example is let's take I'm I'm writing a function now see one function I am having any function one it is accepting two arguments right so we are calling this function we are passing 5 and 4 and it is doing just some of these arguments and here I am just writing print and here in this function I am writing return C return this C right so here it will simply print this value to the screen but when control will come to this line then what will happen it will not show whatever the value of C to the user it will return that value to the caller now where is the caller here so it will return this value here so now this complete would be replaced with 9 now 9 would be stored in this output end this we can print we can print or anything we want to do with this value right now yeah this function is obviously and every function is going to return something if you are not writing this return statement here it is going to return none so if you here also you write output and then you print this output then it will give first of all 9 then none because it is returning every function is going to return if you are not returning explicitly then it will implicitly it will return none so yeah it will return none right now this return is going to change the flow of execution of the program because as soon as this is going to encounter then control will go to the caller when wherever the caller in the program means at one point of time the flow of execution is this like this right and suddenly it will the control will switch to the caller so it will change the flow of exhibition but the Sprint is not going to change the flow of execution right and whenever this return would be encountered it will stop the execution of the current function right so we are in this function so execution of this current function would be stopped and control will go to the column so after return if you write something within this function if suppose I am writing print hi then this will not be printed right because exactly from here the execution of this function would be stopped and we will be exit from this function and to the caller will be here right okay so so return we will use when you want to move one value from one point to another point in your code right now the main difference is what when we should use this return when we should use this print because if you simply print here that is also fine we are printing here but simply we are just printing here it's not more than that we are doing here right but somewhere if you want to do something with this value whatever the value the function will return you can pass this one is important you can pass that value as an argument to some another function right you can do whatever you want to do with that value suppose we have a function another function function two so here we will have some definition and in function 2 calling we can pass this output as an argument so further we can use this value because we are returning that value and we are accepting that thing so we can use that value further either we can print or we can pass that value in as an argument to other function or we can do some other calculation and anything so that is a plus point if you want to do this kind of thing then we should use return rather than just print but if you are simply printing you are not returning the value so we can we cannot use this value further right this thing I'll show you with the help of program practically right so the value returned can be used again right but this is not the thing with print the value cannot be used again once you have printed the value that cannot be used again right and print we can use anywhere in the program but return we can only use within a function within a function that's it right so let me show you this thing with the help of practical okay so let's create a new file here print versus return Dot py simply let's define a function same example we will take and like just adding two numbers right so we will simply do like a plus b and in one case we will simply print C that's it and see we are calling this function we are passing 3 and 4. so it will print 7. right now rather than this let's just copy paste this thing and we will just comment this out right rather than print we will return this value return C so it is going to return this this value to the caller so we will be storing this value in a variable output and in this case first thing we are simply printing this output so that is also will give you seven so obviously you will you are not seeing any difference here I mean both are like same but if see if we are printing we are not returning here anything but I'm just modifying this a little bit output one output two Function One function two so here see now let's comment this out now let me run this C7 plus none why none because every function is going to return something we are not returning here explicitly anything then it will return none so if you accept this thing in any variable and you print that variable then it will print none right now see the main thing the main advantage of you can say using this return return statement is what this value we can use further this return C it is now in output two so we can use further this value we can use this again so if suppose we are passing this in function one that suppose I am passing a b not a b simply I am going to call this function function 1 and I'll pass output 2 this output 2. whatever it is returning that I am passing in function one so suppose I am one variable I'm taking like X and I'm returning X whatever the value is in that I'll just add 1. simple one you can do anything we are not printing here and let's delete this and whatever this function will return I am storing that in final output variable right and then I'll print this final output variable right so let's run this see it will print eight y eight because first of all this function would be called function 2 3 and 4 will be passed means 7 it will return seven now again we are calling this function one and we are passing the seven the output to whatever the output from that function then 7 plus 1 is 8 and the final output is eight so we are passing whatever this this function will return we are passing that again as an argument to another function so we are using that value again right like if you are calculating something like 3 plus 4 in a calculator 7 then plus again then plus so previous result we are using and in the same we are doing add add add add like this same thing we will be doing in next video same project like we are making a we will be making a calculator right so then you will get it better why we should use this return rather than simply just print right so I hope you got basic difference between print and return and when we should use return so that was a simple one like difference between print and return but that is crucial also you should have idea you should be very clear about what a Sprint what is returned when to use print when to use return right what is advantage of using return in which situation we are using return function right now in the next video we'll see one project take care
