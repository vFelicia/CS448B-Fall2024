hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing 2D arrays right in the previous video we have seen like the addressing in 2D array how addressing is to be done for the 2D array elements how the addresses to be calculated two formulas for row measure and for column measure right one with with one example also we have seen that thing based on that only we have an coding exercise in this video we have to do this thing right so what is the question see an array this is the array right something like this a 15 to 10 the ranges and column raes 15 to 40 requires one bite of stories one bite of stories if the beginning location is this then determine the location of this element if you have seen my previous video and if you know the formula both for row measure and column measure you have to find out this location right so now pause the video and first thre try this out right and please let me know in comment section that you have done it yourself without watching this video right okay now see what we have to do first we don't know the number of columns and number of rows in this areay because the range is given so now if you want to calculate number of rows then how you will calculate that is I'm going to represent that by default M right so this is what this is LR this is ur you can say means lower limit for row row index and this is upper limit for row Index this is LC lower limit for column index and this is upper limit for column Index right so if you draw this something then it it would be something like this minus 4 3 up to 0 then up to 10 1 2 3 4 like this right and here we have columns column index is 15 16 up to 40 something like this right so index is not from zero row index and column index proper limit are given right so that would be upper limit that is ur minus LR + 1 right so this would be like 10 5 + 1 and it would be 26 same number of columns how you will calculate let's represent this with n UC minus LC + 1 that would be 40 15 + 1 and this would be I guess same 26 so we have M and N now you know the formula for row measure what is the formula we have the formula is Base address plus i LR into number of columns n plus J minus LC this formula we have discussed in previous video how we are going to you know say how we are going to like figure out that this is the formula right this thing properly we have seen in previous video into size so here Base address is500 plus you just have to put the values I obviously this is I this is J index I for J for column so 15 minus minus LR is 15 right into number of n is what 26 plus J is 20 minus LC is 15 into sizes requires one by of is one so if you calculate this thing then you will get 2285 right now still if you're watching this and you haven't done it yourself then next is please pause the video and calculate for column measure this was for row measure representation if this array is represented in memory in column measure ordering then what would be the address of this a 15 to 20 pause the video and try this out so for column measure the formula is Base address plus here we will take J minus LC into m + i LR into size just put the values now 1500 plus now J value is 20 minus lower limit of column is 15 into m is 26 plus I is 15 minus LR 15 into 1 that's it so it would be 166 zero okay I hope you got these two formulas right this is very important you have to you know it's not like that you just gram this is the formula no you have to understand why this formula why Jus LC into M plus IUS LR for column measure and all this thing properly with proper example in detail I have discussed in previous video please watch out that video first right because you have to understand it would be then in your mind for longer period of FR if you cram if you just remember if you just want to learn like this is the formula okay it's okay you'll forget uh you know this thing very easily after some point of time but if you got it why this formula then it would be in your mind I think forever right so that's it for this video now in the next video we'll see vectors in C++ and that would be you know nowadays it's like trending Concept in you know in languages like STL standard template Library especially if you are working in C++ and you are you doing project then definitely obviously you are using vectors and everywhere whenever you go to that you on that lead code when you going to solve that lead code question in there also by default you will see that class Vector something like this they have written they are not going to you know they're not using arrays but why so what is Vector why vectors the these things we'll be discussing in next video right so now I'll see you in the next bye bye take care
