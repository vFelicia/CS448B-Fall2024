SME apnea in Korea VTEC me what an exam happened I will go step by step of neon Scalia that's it no if you want to remember that I Buddhism or any meaningful lesson then you have to you know go for the logic you have to understand how to practice on that that is the only way if an attack algorithm you should write down that program at your own you should write on that program one by one Bridal means without any ID on pen or paper using pen or paper right here in that program that this whole loop will be run this time I will write now I cannot we thank you so much first of all automatically I cannot start right now some distorted maybe I have some problem in the smile today I guess let me check okay can you please start by that and what a car okay I'm sorry Karthik right now I cannot start by then because first of all I need to completely be a mess then I'm planning to start C C++ or maybe it would actually do algorithms because for algorithm you can say foot da but that's a project and getting new request right so I'm thinking to start that one here like you're teaching very much well thank you so much okay I think my connection is unstable so I'm it's hanging out gate D a sustainable designs class of sod homes the triples become little spaces see I cannot start anything because I'm right now focusing on net and gate actually but syllabus is not like that because I have also time great for nature Phyllis Peaks and computer science when I was preparing for name right so it's same how my gaze it will take to complete DBMS I can say but maybe around one month maybe but I am planning to start after completing this normalization concept means I guess we are left with multivalue dependency and the fourth normal form and fifth normal form basically so after completing this normalization topic then I will start new subject right because Asian is you know very important for the point of view of created net example that I have already completed okay hi from Sri Lankan hi from India let's get married yeah microprocessor lectures yeah that I will start by one go ma'am okay yeah good night good night how are you I'm good from Siobhan's okay so named mine okay please teacher in my knowledge engineering college but for quite a teacher hey so good in Python Ashley yeah I can teach but I am NOT you know an export type of in Python so occupy three you know Python language carajo is a better than um a knife at home but definitely is only out of their only lordship means TVB shots on techno match be and fly be okay you may hello hello ishtam you are a good teacher thank you yeah only out oh yeah that's sad news main difficulty no dear I'm not yeah I'm working in a car I'm a sister please don't ask now in which college right yeah I think you're yeah I know I am getting this error but your connection is unstable to me and I don't know why I am giving this problem today hi hi okay which college CI first that I negate will you not do not ask in which college how to buy a very smart teacher well thank you so much what is your read score my gates were was around I remember that percentile around 94% time Oh week she really connect is see me but Vanessa I cannot rely on that thing mucho la v√≠a hang and thank you my many please go see language lectures okay and in equivalent in Jenny's lectures Lori good mate right now yes I'm assistant professor you do job yeah I am amen please start I'm sorry idiot I didn't read out that things I'm sorry Johnny which city yet bread Oh city at all you know the garden DC yes seriously I don't know yeah maybe that microprocessor and electronics that I can teach from EC branch any other subject I don't think I can teach means you have Romney see branch right okay you know college I am assistant professor in there is lectures I am he just one suggestion but tree down your position can you please send me again because because of many comments how do we learn all the programming skills a you cannot learn programming skill first of all you have to practice right and no one is perfect just practice practice injected I still remember when I was doing empty I was not good at programming would you wonder let the program be little baby seriously to be very few practicals they put the heat oh yeah you definitely program that is it it's over stick butter Co Garin pasta Java but after the potential idea is very important skipper you know I started practice practice in practice you have to build your own watch you do try at least I know it's not so easy it's starting you have knee problem Dickey and parnell logic in theory yes I know that is so easy but of course obviously you have to start from somewhere basics operator you have to practice that thing try to develop your own virtue try to attend that program rather than on compiler first of all is fully cooperate people say with your hand nobody key on that ID that is why I prefer we don't explain that you know my program in my videos on that bolo me rather than on an ID right and you brine on that program because of some hope a child let that concept up it was like after that yeah obviously I you know make a score under 12 output it to say a and against a bar you know in the video black McKee had a belonging acceptable and scale so this can appraise it now practically nahi but as modular programming me I said we could achieve over third starting mania pullup thank in Ireland but it's villagers are starting I was also one of you the operator in see hey when I start when I start see then only he'll cover these subjects I'm confused where to start and programming where to start if you don't know anything then definitely you can start from see that is the basic language a very simple language obviously hello world hello world hello is very right but just I'm kidding see language um Sikorski basics start Peru the IDH go to study programs Panama shiro kuroh steam bother micrograms balance activism right this case every technique is ready programming both hard with you if I can do I'm sure you can also do what are your hobbies I just love to solve puzzles do you think solo como gap which were present so become I mean it was all worth investing okay look for my et left now hey thanks ta and then it is to me to offer it on GRE them with Harwood you can woman if you want to look more than me must work GRE is how do I maintain it if you think that's not a religion okay data structure structure I'm sorry I was not able to get on that see how to dope the it is just give your best image so Joe Caputo come and just give you invest right happy so to put your top Kani exam is oh I guess holy pressure create will act on screen I boost I'm very happy a source to a beautifully up unum best in each other they are Academy handed to me occurs in the article basics clear through previous in pushing papers all through of course there is a question here anyways for college students per goal is against for first year it will be different for second year third year and finally it will be different in which year you are it depends hey I'm from Pakistan hello dear okay I'm getting many comments so I'm not able to read out all the comments actually CSE will be better yes Heidi or CSU are asking them see according to me I don't know but according to me will be better tips for second year okay secondly it means maybe you are having a data structure known so just focus on your programming skills right if you want to go for a product based companies not a service based companies right just focus on the main means of projects and it's not like that you have to be good in all the subjects right and apart from that you definitely try to do something extra which you can add in your resume after completing your BTech do not waste your four years just in you know regular study in college if you are very good in programming just you know you can join any you can be a freelancer or you can you know contribute in any means that is for those who are very good in any open source project means do some some training or something like that or maybe he internship a very good company so that you can add that client in you and that will you know differ you from other students SME okay harnesses we taking here or up please many watching TV make surfing yeah your introduction your you know that career objective your details your name like that right which is different will not it is moving me to interview to attract July birthday yay good chat is never cheat I have with techniques otherwise we get to submit at the inside a subject some people think you should do something different right maybe at least one thing you can do okay hello from IIT Lucknow thanks dear Java basics yeah oh yeah I can teach you not start right now Oh Java because you see I'm free I have told you many times because I'm not a team actually I'm a single person and I have job also so I cannot start all the subjects at the same time now so it's very tough dynamic programming okay whether I have already uploaded some videos on dynamic programming but okay and solve some more problems with that I'll try to complete that I think pattern would be maybe you know the language which is I'm friendly should I think you should go for that one so according to me okay like a big company s I mean heck II see if you are a thresher to SME in River Rock six feet for a campus of pooja town I'm telling you the truth right woopsie expect for the company over Amazon Microsoft edge forgive them when you have technically you know the basics a people capability here that you can solve the problem at least it's not like that normally program there and you have to approve them correct to scar logic with my hair off good energy canal if party up keep the now you know search party who logically given in critical thinking logically you cows may use cut right as an AV output on the heat cilia right you have to be learn that because when we ate it oh maybe I'll put an immediate thing for three months or six months the Jobi language and go chill with yoga platform on which a yoga they'll train you on that working learning capability thickness at the basics cleared on each even skinny right so interview you can look for essa personal Haley R Medusa Pucci on actually made once with a fever little meter program subcellular GSN a second thing you have very fun feeding at that time right we have it a Peggy if you are able to express her you know knowledge or not Kaplan book can make our path a path you may be some students are very good so push her tempo but at the time of interview oh no they get you nervous or gopinatha birthing some students are average students through people's in sixty percent marks criteria I guess 60 to 65 a few tiny 8090 valleys but fiscal path my communication skills with one chain right yeah that is very important point a via communication skills to both zero do you mean will be second gear may move who's very focused and I salsa right because when you will be in third your final year so scary time come Bettina time their placement which other camping that first year second year we have open communication skills figure I'll hand them out right as far as I normally according the telling me right maybe she also put yoga to watch along exactly they surpass any ISM anymore they already say but I saw a gif is this your house yeah it's my house interview preparation K videos by now okay means into the preparation tips how to prepare for interview write all the questions you me too you know kiss type a push input is our thing I don't care except it it's the which type of videos you want you can tell me how to think logically programming please please Amy push not be how think method a pop quiz so Tina cases it has a time problems they put it in Java TK was curry excess oil Yaya Han whenever we develop an operator pkcs was watching our house Prabhupada me to Schoology Kalinin and she's eaten each other problems of the cookie flagellum cancel the problem the idea but that's a little jealous type of problem head tourism logic a status illogical still barn you know you can modify it yourself right because I know I have when once I have published a research paper town graham Roubini algorithm so many being a yachtie the neighbor that I give made in the programming proper oozma Kappa me Anita pop down on that it took me around three to four days but before that you know concentrate 30 watt so chivos keeper and he much it cannot be so I see algorithm for your program Oh be modified person you were right or was made a roundrobin car Joe result I had Oh many you know here he'll worry the month program just a better car rather than the conventional Robin algorithm now see right so both SSO functional data disk over here are the problems they prove it is not resolution gave hope you can gotta try the row will be Iowa with SS which man was to negative Matawai Bacardi Marcus Lee Elia over so challenge on sfotch Lincoln is this your house yes actually it's my house he compared to getting is slow yeah I seriously have no idea about that exam but exam but hey slow examined gate exam I have idea that are top because I have tried both I have rightfully so as well but I was not preparing so much I say may the initial anything manly want question him each C++ okay hey love from neighborhood neighborhood where means maybe the Ricky sign because they okay yes I think design how hi ma'am hi Jenny convo thanks I feel like no matter looks no me are doing massive day shift Cappadonna proper anything you pee I think next should be Python Karthik I think but if you have interest in Java then you can go for that gate exam daily puts tips but I do get exam be high arts and even I have to admit exam so please don't start any new subject which may happen akivasha Schmucker or be other after i that we see annual exam me 20 me we are new you are i have just to revise main main points grab my coaching we have to definitely money which shop breaks a push movie but i am / you are a wise through previous l questions because are thus all perceptive it's better for you right gessie this is an equation so I'll continue step your question so just try that thing and yeah it's important yeah Pinellas they owe nothing let me know obviously you got away but mainly some of them yes over here to any I shall buy the a token Camila to hand evil right so just full confidence is not channel yet examine all the best which language definitely will start from a simple language that is I guess C language right C c plus plus 1 over 4 CC this place after off or maybe Java Python or many languages are there so now I guess see I was thinking that I will be loyal following he came to this but it's already 32 minutes so now I should go now school they can have it yahoo via windy at UK yeah just rally at it will be do they've managed okay so now okay my good night I'll see you now in the next slide screen on next Sunday right and thank you so much again thank you thank you thank you for your love and support right doing
