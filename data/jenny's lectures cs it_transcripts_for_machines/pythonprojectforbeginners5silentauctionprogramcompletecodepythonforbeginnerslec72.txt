planning Python programming language this video is part two of the previous video because we are now working on a project we are making a silent auction program or we can say a secret auction program so what is this project what output you will get when you run this program and the flowchart of this project we have discussed in the previous video right now in this video we'll see the solution the complete code one by one step by step so if you haven't tried this out yet please pause the video watch out the previous video and try this out yourself this is a simple project it's for beginners and then we'll see the solution together right I hope now you have watched the previous video and you have tried this out now let's see the solution together so let's create a new file here and Silent option Dot py right now very first step you will Implement you just keep your flowchart of this project that what we have discussed in previous video with you on a paper right I have mine see this one right so one by one we'll see the we'll implement the step so first is you have to input name and the bid price so obviously we have our input function we know how to use input function so first is you will ask what is your name then next input is price bid price what is your bid but see one thing you need to take care using input if you will take the bid it would be maybe 10 000 rupees 5000 rupees and that is integer but using input you will take that would be considered as string so better at this point only type cast this right otherwise it will give error so we are going to write past this thing okay now next step is you have to add this name and bid into a dictionary why in a dictionary we are storing the data because we are storing obviously we want like first the name of the person then bid price this type of thing we want like if you write on a piece of paper then how you will write these prices name like Jenny then bid price then maybe name Ram with price like this so this type of data arrangement we can also do or you can say imitate in programming with help of dictionary we have a data structure like dictionary so that's why we are using a dictionary here because it is uh you can say you know dictionary is a great way to store this type of data structured information right okay now let's take our dictionary name so first we'll take suppose an empty dictionary so better data that's an empty dictionary right or better to take this before asking the name and price okay you will get it why I am taking for at first this empty dictionary better data and this is with an empty dictionary right now how to add say this name would be key and price would be value in a dictionary right so how to add data and dictionary we have discussed this thing previous so the name of the dictionary then here the key value key is the name whatever in the name we will provide so name and equal to value value is in which variable price fine okay now this will ask only for one time name and price but we want it will ask first the question are there are there any other better more better if you press yes then it will ask again name and price again if it will you will you will enter yes again it will ask name and price so this asking of this name and price this should be in a loop but how many time we don't know as many times as you enter yes yes yes it will ask once you press no it will exit so we don't know the number of iteration so which is the best Loop in this case while loop right so we'll put this thing in a while U right how I'll show you first ah let me just ask the question are there more better you have to type yes or no suppose I am taking this yes or no ins like I I consider they should be in small right so let's just use a function here it will convert whatever you will type if you will type capital y e s it will convert into lower so whatever you will enter that we are going to store in a variable and the variable is suppose we are taking this name uh this name more bidders right okay now we will check if this variable morbidder is equal to equal to if it is a no then if it is a no check the flowchart then you have to find out the highest bid in the dictionary so for that suppose rather than writing the complete code in this if just Define a function separate function and we will call the function if morbidders are no suppose function name I am taking find winner and there what you have to pass the dictionary the complete data the information of all the bidders right so that we are having in this dictionary bidder data that simply you need to pass right and obviously now if more there are no more videos then you have to exit so how to exit at the point of time you have to put a condition to exit from the loop so first write down a while loop here while okay if if we don't know the definite number of iteration we use while loop but what condition you will put here generally in this case is we use a flag variable right flag variable is true right at first flag variable we'll set flag variable if also true it depends which type of logic you are going to implement and then we are going to flip that flag variable within this while loop if certain exit condition is occurred right so we are taking first a variable end of bidding and obviously it's not end of bidding so at first it is false so while not and of bidding this is the condition at first it is false not false is true so while true means we are going to enter into this value but these everything within this while loop should be indented right now if morbidders are known so now it's time to flip the variable because now it's time to exit from this while loop so now we are going to flip the variable end of bidding is equal to two because if it is true then again in next iteration while not true means not true means false while false means condition uh is not true false means exit from the lukina right and then simply call this function right okay now let's define this function first obviously you have to define the function before calling so how to define a function def same name you need to take what find winner and we are passing a dictionary so only one argument you are passing so one parameter name you need to take and that I am taking suppose bitter details right okay now we have better details suppose in a dictionary we are having two values Jenny with price Ram with some big price right okay now you have to look through through this dictionary because how to access the price the values using keys we can access right so we have to access the first price first we have to access Jenny then the price then second ram then price and compare those prices which is the highest if three then also we will access the third one and we'll compare right you have to find out the highest so if you know the logic to find highest from given numbers from three numbers or four numbers then it would be definitely easy for you guys to write down this logic right okay now a for Loop for bidder in with the details and if we write down this kind of for Loop then this this will Loop through all the keys this thing we have discussed especially this for Loop when we're discussing the introduction to dictionaries right for better in better details suppose in better details I am having like this Jenny 10 000 and next Ram 30 000. or suppose three one more sham fifty thousand suppose this is my dictionary right now for better in better detail so first time it will Loop through the keys so first time in bidder Jenny would be assigned Jenny now according to the journey we have to we have to fetch the bid price how to fetch we know first take a variable name in which whatever price is there we are going to fetch that we are going to store in that variable so suppose we are taking a variable and bidding price and how to fetch this name of the dictionary and in subscript just pass the key the key is in this variable bidder now Jenny will be passed and 10 000 would be fetched and that would be now in bidding price so now in bidding price we are having 10 000. right now one by one we are going to compare so if you know the logic how to find out maximum from three numbers there are multiple logic but one is simply we suppose before this for Loop simply first we set we are going to take a variable highest bit equal to zero right now we will compare now we have one bidding price ten thousand so we compare if this bidding price is greater than the highest bid this bid definitely it is greater because first at first it is zero so what you will do we will change this highest bit highest bid now becomes whatever the bidding price right now highest bit is zero bidding price now at this point of time 10 000 so yeah this condition is true now in highest bit equal to bidding price so 10 000 would be assigned to this highest bid it's not zero now it's ten thousand right okay now same again next time in next iteration in bidder Ram would be assigned so we'll fetch the ram detail of ram in bidding price this time we are having thirty thousand we are having thirty thousand so check if bidding price greater than highest bid highest bid now is ten thousand bidding price is thirty thousand condition true yes enter and highest bid becomes bidding price so highest become highest bid becomes now what is the bidding price right now thirty thousand so it becomes thirty thousand right and suppose sham for sham it's only five thousand next time sham would be assigned in bidder so bidding price is 5000 now check bidding price five thousand greater than highest bid is thirty thousand is is it condition true this condition true no so will not enter into this if block so this highest bid would not be changed and this would be 30 000 only right now okay if suppose you are having only three data so that's it after that what now you have to print winner is Ram with a bit of thirty thousand right so suppose we are again here taking a empty string right so at this point of time whenever whenever equal to whatever the bidder is within this for Loop only we will assign winner equal to bidder right okay now outside of this for Loop we will print using F string like the winner is and that value we have in this sorry this variable winner with a bid price of and that value we are having in this variable highest bid right I know it will work or not let's run this and see let's run this and what it will ask what is your name Jenny bid 10 000 yes but see one problem is here if you are you enter yes it should clear the previous bidder price and name but it is not clearing so that one thing you have to include still in your program what is your name Ram price fifty thousand more better yes sham price only five thousand no the winner is Ram with a bid of fifty thousand yeah this program is working only one thing you need to add if you press if you enter yes the previous name and the bid price should be cleared because no other person can see the other person bid so that we need to implement now here we are having we are not having like in C and the C plus we are in clear screen method so here what you have to import a module OS so there are okay multiple methods also to clear this screen right one way I'm just telling you in OS module we have a function system and you have to call that function you have to just pass one parameter clf if you are working on Windows and if you are working on Linux then you have to pass what uh clear C and eer so I am working on windows so just import this first OS and when I want to clear the screen when at that point only you need to call the system function with CLS parameter so if morbidder know then true and then find better but if else if more bidders equal to equal to yes at this point of time we need to clear the screen so one more condition you need to put LF more better equal to yes then just call the function from OS module OS Dot system function and what command you need to give CLS in bracket parameter into pass CLS if you are working in Windows okay now one more thing you have to run this in Python console right so first thing if I directly run this in Python console right click here and if I run run file in Python console it will not run see error running this silent auction there is some error so what you need to do first you need to change some condition something right click on this file right then you have to modify the Run configuration what if I run configuration and here this on execution we have a option emulate terminal in output console right just take this thing and apply okay now right click here run file in Python console and see what's your name bid 10 000 more better yes now see previous screen is cleared yes Ram bid like this more better yes sham bid only 1000 enter morbidder no so the winner is Jenny with the bid price ten thousand and if you want to display at the last if you want to display all the information like all the person all the bidders and with bidder price so simply I think you can modify this thing I want to display the information of all the bidder At Last At Last when you press no how you'll do that pause the video in this try this out so I hope you have done this now before printing the winner here outside of this for Loop after this for Loop in this definition of this function before printing the winner simply you can print and you can just uh sorry print the better detail because in this dictionary we are having the detail of every everyone or whatever you want to line right like if you want to write down here is the detail of all the bidders that here is the list of all the bidders and okay let's run this but you have to run like this run file in Python console after right clicking this name Jenny and suppose one lakh more better yes Ram with some bit price yes sham what is your bed some bed price no now say I'm entering no so first it will show here is the list of all the bidders Jenny Ram sham with the detail and winner is Jenny with a bid price of 10 000. one lakh so I guess now you got how to do this project if you're not getting this thing it's okay just write down this com the detail or you can see the code of this project on a piece of paper and same method you have to apply right on this take the values like one by one step by step this first this thing then second this this this like this right and yeah we have to add one more line like this that at first it should print you just simply print welcome to the silent auction program so whenever you run this at first you will print this line I guess so you just you can just write down this thing the code on a piece of paper and write in this with the help of you know some information you need to pass one by one first the step then this step and this step right so I guess that's it for this video if you are having any more issues here then you can ask me in comment section right so now in the next video we'll see more about functions so now it's in the next tutorial then bye bye take care
