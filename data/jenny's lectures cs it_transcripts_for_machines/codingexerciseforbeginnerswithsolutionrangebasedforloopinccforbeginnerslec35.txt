hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language in the previous video we have seen what is range based for Loop and why we use this and how this is different from traditional for Loop and with the heck of program we have seen that thing right now based on that we will do one coding exercise in this video okay based on Range based for Loops so now the exercise Is We I have given you a vector this is a vector although we haven't discussed Vector till now in the series we'll be discussing in detail what Vector is but it's like you can say for now you can say it's a dynamic array just like array but we can change the size of vector so as you can see array is also something like this how to declare or Define a vector just write down Vector here in these brackets will lie down int or you can say the data type their type of this all the data is int the name of the vector any variable you can take a b c x y num back num anything and this is the vector the value of vector is 3 6 15 and till 300 something like this okay now you have to use range based for Loop to Loop through this vector and you have to find out how many numbers are evenly divisible by either 3 or 5. make this thing very clear I am saying evenly divisible by either three or five how many numbers you have to count those numbers and you have to use a range based for loop I guess this is not so much stuff if you have idea about range base for Loop how to use this thing and if you have idea like how to find out if a number is divisible by like maybe three or five or any other number we use like mode module operator okay so now let's pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have tried this out let's do this together so create a new file coding exercise 4 dot CPP because we have done three coding says before so at first what include IO stream the setter file then we will use Vector here so you have to include Vector also this header file and then using namespace STD why we are including this header Vector that we will see when we will discuss Vector in detail right using namespace STD and int main you can access my C plus playlist and there in the starting videos you will get why we are why we are using this we are including this file this you know line using namespace STD why we are including the screen space so please check out the C plus plus complete playlist and then in the starting videos you will get the basic videos right okay now I've given you a vector and the name of the this Vector is suppose I'm taking num what are the values in this Vector 3 5 6 these values we have so let's take a variable count at starting we are initializing this count with zero now put condition if sorry obviously you have to use first because we have to Loop through this complete Vector we will take first three then we will check it is divisible by either three or five then six then fifteen so every variable we have to take so we'll use range base for you four let's write down here Auto rather than it and the variable M suppose in time taking and the name of this Vector is num okay num that the range expression name is num so now let's put the condition if this n is divisible by more 3 equal to equal to 0. if it is completely divisible by a 3 then modulo operator will give 0. and here sorry after that either by 3 or 5 so this is our operator logical one or n mode 5 equal to equal to 0. if this is the case we will do just count plus plus okay and after this for Loop not print C out C out just print your count variable that's it returns 0 I hope this is not the tough one logic is not tough one because see first time in nam we have three this is a collection so first time n becomes n equal to 3 3 would be assigned right now let's check this condition if 3 mode 3 equal to equal to 0 yes completely divisible by 3 so this condition is true it is logical or logical or means either this or this to be true if this is true then no need to check the second condition if this is true this complete expression will give true okay and if true means you will enter into this if statement and count plus plus one now count becomes 1. right next time 6 would be assigned to This n now next time n becomes 6. now check six mode three equal to equal to 0 yes we will divide six by three then the remainder is 0 so this condition is true so this condition is 2 means this complete expression will give true so we'll enter here now count becomes two for 15 now see 15 is divisible by 3 yes so we will not check the next condition again count becomes now 3. okay now 17 see 17 more 3 equal to equal to 0 no 17 then we will check the second condition if this is false then we'll check the second condition 17 mod 5 equal to equal to 0 no this is also false so we'll not enter here count plus plus no count plus plus now for 18 we will check then same for 21 then 55 then 100 200 and 300 like this right okay let's run this and see what output you will get here so 9 9 elements are completely divisible by either three or five see one two three four five six seven eight nine yeah only 17 is left otherwise these elements are either divisible by three completely evenly divisible by 3 or 5. so answer is 9. I guess that is not so tough coding exercise okay if you haven't got this thing it's okay just write down this code on a piece of paper write on this take this dry run this manually rather than here one by one step by step what is happening by writing like this right then definitely you will get it so I hope you have done this exercise yourself or if you haven't done this if you are facing any problem now you are clear with this exercise okay because we have discussed the solution in the next video we'll see what is break and continue and why we use break and continuing Loops so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
