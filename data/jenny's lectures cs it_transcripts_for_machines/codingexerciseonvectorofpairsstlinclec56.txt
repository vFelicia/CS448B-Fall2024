hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language in the previous video we have seen what is Vector of pairs right I hope that is clear to you guys because based on that only we'll be discussing one coding exercise in this video right it's not stough simple one what is this exercise let's see you are given a vector of size n which holds pair of integer pair of integers right now you have to calculate some of the second element of these pairs second element of these pairs right means 2 + 10 + 4 you have to calculate this thing right I hope you are getting the problem statement right and it's not tough you have to just access the second element of the pairs within this Vector right I hope you can do this now you have to pause the video and try this out so let's create a new file and we are going to solve this now so now first take the vector which is given Vector of pair not Vector it's Vector of pair having integer value both integer value right okay now let's suppose we have vector v and the values given are first is 1 two right so how to access second element from these pairs so obviously we have to trace the vector first first element of the vector is 1 2 this is first element having a pair means pair means two values this is second element of vector means V of Zer at zero index we have this pair at one index we have this pair at second index we have this pair every index are having two values because we have a pair right okay now with the help of four Loop let's trace this one first first element then second element of vector then third element of vector if we got the first element of the vector like one two pair then within that we can access this two do second keyword we have right do first and do second this is how we are going to access elements of pair right so here let's take first obviously we will take a variable sum in which you're going to store the sum and let's initialize it with zero so that it will not take any garbage value simply we take a variable this is what you can say traditional way of using food Loop like a variable initialize it with zero and this I would be less than till Vector size so we have a function here in Vector do size to calculate the size automatically it will calculate the size then Plus+ I or I ++ and within this you have to do what you have to access now from V ofi from V of I now V of Z means this first element but you have to access only two so voi dot second because one two is pair first first element of pair is one second element is two so dot second I want to access right so the the second element of all the pairs and just add this two into sum so sum equal to sum plus v ofi do second I hope you got why I have written this line or we can simply write down if you use that short end operator then Su plus equal to v i do second right I hope it works okay first obviously you have to now print that sum so let's print simply sum and returns Z okay let's run this and see what output you are getting now 8 so see 10 + 2 12 4 it's 8 right okay it's working fine if you don't use this kind of loop we can use that range based for Loop also all right for that what we will do that is I guess very simple just write down this Auto keyword Auto and any variable name suppose I'm taking element and from which range which container I'm going to take the elements from V from this vector v right so it means from vector v 1X one all the elements would be stored stor in this variable so first this one two this pair would be stored in this element I mean in this variable variable name is element or we can take n any small name we can take n in this variable n 1 2 from this N I want to exess Second element of the pair because this one two is pair because first element of the vector is pair second element is also a pair obviously it is Vector of pairs right so this time what you can do su is equal to sum plus now from this n you have to access now in N we have this pair 1 2 so n dot second and semicolon right you know you know no need to worry about the size and all like this so I like this Loop in this you know range based for Loop so let's print some and uh let's run this and see we're getting same output or not yeah we getting eight right I hope you've done this exercise right it's not so much Stu so try out different different exercises on the vectors Pairs and Vector of pairs right in the next video we'll see most probably nesting of vectors like array of vectors and Vector of vectors what is the difference between these two things because these are very confusing array of vectors and Vector of vectors so the this thing we'll be discussing in next video right you please try out different different exercises based on whatever topic we are going we are covering in this cabus in this course because for me it's not possible to you know uh cover all the or you know uh discuss all the exercises on all the topics one or two exercise I can discuss but I'll I'm I'm not trying to cover all the you know that concept or theory part in detail right but for now I guess that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
