will play crucial role in deciding your rank in gate examination right this is very important so you have to decide you have to prepare your last one month strategy and that's exactly i'll discuss in this video what should be your last one month strategy to get a good rank or for your no to crack date examination with a good rank right but this last one month strategy also depends on students because maybe some students are preparing for this examination since last one year right or maybe some i know have just started maybe three or four months ago so it depends on student to student what should be your last one month strategy right but all the points we'll discuss in this video for those i think i'm assuming that right now because it's december and i think you have completed your syllabus right and now it's time to revise everything because reason is very very very important rather than completing all this labor so rather than you know you know at this point of time time rather than going for a new subject or new topic it's right time to start revision of all the subjects whatever you have read whatever you have read for that you have to do revision right now do not underestimate the power of revision maybe you have prepared very well all the subjects but if you will not revise at the last time in this month then definitely you are going to forget some concept or formulas or some important or you can say the key points that would be very very very important so you have to revise right now it's the right time to start revision so now i assume that you have completed your slaves till now now it's right time to start revision right or maybe it's time to start if you want very good rank in gate exam like maybe you're fighting for rank one it's the right time to start test series full length mock test you just devote your one month january for full length mock test so i just want to tell you one thing geeks four geeks has a complete gate preparation pack as well as test series in this pack you will get six courses for your all round preparation and this will include compiler design toc dbms operating system coa along with test series so this will help you there's parents like you to track and to improve your preparation through the various difficulty level questions here you will get subjective test also plus five full length mock test and

put the links in the description box of this video so what are you waiting for just go and get yourself registered to ace get exam so this test series is going to play a very important role for your gate preparation start practicing full length mock test i hope you have done with the subjective test if you are not then you can start subjective test also plus full length mock test if you are done with c many students are done with subjective mock test previous year question paper and the syllabus and revision also they have done the revision also so for complete one month just devote this month for full length mock test you will get a rank under 10. 10 i'm damn sure it's not like that just take test series and that's it on the next day another test no you have to analyze this also means maybe you are attempt attempting some question wrong right so analyze that test series why you are attempting that question wrong maybe you you you haven't read that concept or maybe you have read that concept but you forgot it so go through your notes and revise that concept right or maybe it's calculation error or maybe because of the virtual calculator the numerical questions you are not habitual of using virtual calculator so because of that you are doing mistake so rectify your mistakes and work on those mistakes yeah you can make mistakes while attempting question in test series but you cannot afford to make the same mistake again while writing the gate exam on your dday that will cost you right so better to rectify your mistake in this test series work on those mistakes and try to improve yourself so analysis is very important right next thing is virtual calculator try to solve questions while attempting the test series in this try to solve questions using virtual calculator right because once you do this you will be familiar with this you know you know using of this virtual calculator and it will improve your speed so better to use virtual calculator for solving questions in this test series right mock test smoke test right because directly if you will use this calculator on your exam day definitely it will slow down your speed because you are not habitual of using this calculator right so don't use any physical calculator use virtual calculator right and right now i recommend please avoid going for any new subject or any new topic see maybe you have you have just started your preparation like three to four months ago and you still left with few you know subjects in which you are good right so you can go for those subjects and means you have just you know 15 to for 10 to 15 days and after 10 to 15 days for 15 to 20 days you can revise and you can go for test series but you know if you have done the important subjects like ft is very important you have done ft you have done that mathematics and three or four subject like data structure and programming which is very important toc dbms i think these subjects it's not they they'll they'll not ask a very you know tough question from these subjects so you should go for these subject first thoroughly you know these subjects should be very very very strong because from ft you will get 15 marks from maths also i think 14 to 15 marks from dsn programming also you will get i guess seven to ten marks from toc also i guess eight to ten marks i guess from this you will get 10 10 to 12 marks right and dbms also you will get seven to eight marks so if you are very very good in these subjects you can easily score 50 marks so see i would recommend go for those subjects which are having higher weightage and you are good in those subject so go for those subjects rather than preparing all the subjects right and especially right now because you don't have much time so rather than starting a new subject revise these subject previous subjects whatever you have prepared right division is very very very important so don't go for any new subject right now right and please don't avoid ft section still you have time if you have you know you haven't prepared every section and many students do this mistake they think that empty no they they more focus on the four subjects yeah it's good to focus on the course subjects but rather than you know attempting reading you know studying all the core subjects better to choose three four five that's it in which you are good you know and having those subjects are having higher weight is strong you know strongly or you can say thoroughly prepare those subject you have to be very strong in the these subjects plus empty focus on ft and maths ft is a deciding factor right for your gate rank and many students underestimate the power of ft please don't do this thing hardly you will take 10 to 15 days to prepare ft not for the complete day for three to four hours you can just in a day you can give the send you can just solve you know just solve the previous year questions five year previous question on this empty and that's it right so please don't avoid this aptitude section right next things please don't panic calm yourself down right now yeah i know you have pressure like you know please don't over think many student you know sit and they think what if i'm not able to pass the gate examination what if i'm not able to get good rank what will happen see it just it's just an exam you can reappear next time or if you have prepared well maybe you are not getting good rank it's okay you have many more opportunities also you can create many more exams also right it's okay please don't get so much tension and stress yourself because if you will do this thing whatever you have prepared that would you will ruin that thing and ultimately it will affect your health and that is very very very important you have to take care of yourself this is the next point you have to do in this last last month right you have to take care of yourself you have to eat healthy some sleep you have to take right exercise meditation follow a proper routine in this month see because you cannot afford to fall sick right now it will affect your preparation and as well as on the dday if your temperature is high maybe they will check the temperature and then they'll allow you allow you because of these situation whatever situation is going on right now right so you have to stay healthy also right and see while revising and while doing these test series and all in the last one month breaks are very important you have to take proper breaks also and fruitful breaks not just set idle and overthink no and please don't start any you know watching a movie or any new web series don't just scroll any social media and anything don't waste time you have to utilize every single minute you have to take proper breaks you can just if you are taking break like whatever is good for you like you can do meditation in those breaks or maybe you can help your mother something like that what i do is i generally use to solve aptitude questions right because i feel fresh after solving these kind of questions like one man is going you know 20 kilometer to the north and then 20 kilometer to the south and at last where is he and this kind of questions or blood blood relation questions or whatever you know in which you are interested you can solve those kind of questions so break also plus preparation also both the things will happen at the same time so you can do this thing also and if you feel like this will exhaust your mind then you can just like know you can listen a song or this kind of thing but breaks should be fruitful so in brief just want to tell you one thing revision is very important do as much revision as can do in the last one month and go for test series full length mock test right this will you know make you a habit to sit for three hours in the exam and how to you know solve the questions within that time frame within those three hours that is also very very very important because many students are not able to do the time management they are not able to do the complete you know all the questions in that time frame within that time frame right that also you have to do some you know you have to work on your time management skill also and that will come with the practice when you will practice these full length mock tests right so i guess that's it for this video and i'll see you in the next next video till then bye take care
