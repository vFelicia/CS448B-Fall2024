so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen for Loop in Python right so next topic is foreigns Yes you heard it right it's four else not f l you must have heard if else in other programming languages like if you have if you are from CEC plus Java background then if else but not four else and while else right but yeah in Python we have a facility to use else this else keyword with for loop as well as with while loop right now what is this for else in Python the working the syntax why we use this when to use this and all we'll be discussing in this video about Forex with the help of program practically I will show you right but see the working is different from if else maybe you are thinking if else the working Forex would be same as if else and you know the working of vehicles may be right but no no no no the working is totally different see what is f else simply we write like if here we have if block here we have condition right then some statement then we have else and here also we have some statements right so either this or this block would be executed not both either this or this suppose I am taking like a is equal to 1 B is equal to a simple example so I'm thinking like if a equal to equal to B right this thing then print a is a and b are same else you will Print Different like and we are different right so the condition C A is 1 B is 2 is this condition true no so control will not go here control will go in else part and it will print different if a is 1 B is 1 in this case a is one B is one both are same condition true so control will enter here it will print A and B are same so control will not enter here so either this flow or this flow could be executed based on the condition whether it's true or not but not both the blocks right right if something like this if you are going to supermarket and your mom asked like buy mangoes and if mangoes are not available then buy apples right first condition is you will see search if mangoes are available you will buy mangoes otherwise otherwise it is what else otherwise by Apple okay so only one thing either mangoes or apples not both but here what first of all let's see the syntax then I'll show you the working also the syntax is simply you know the working of a whole Loop that we have discussed in previous video right so here we have this four any variable name in the sequence sequence is like less double set or dictionary or string right then statement one or more statements then after this we'll be using else without any indentation it is in the same line with 4 this these statements are indented right else here also we will write some statements or statement or statements this is else block right this is else block this is four now this sorry this else block would be executed these statements would be executed only if notice the difference only if this for Loop has completed successfully I am focusing on this line these the cells block would be executed the statement of else block would be executed only if this for Loop has completed successfully successfully not terminated like using break statement or if there is no if there is an error then also the sales flow would not be executed right let's see and I hope you know like for Loop is more like an iterator in Python not like we have some iterator method in other object 200 programming languages so for Loop is more like an iterator in this language in Python language so which is doing iteration traversing a sequence so sequence means we'll take any list string dictionary or set or tuples right and these statements would be executed once for each item in that sequence right that is basically for Loop and python right now we'll see one example so I am taking a list number is equal to this and the variable name I'm taking I in sequence name is now here we have numbers right and I'm just printing numbers print I that's it and after that else and here I'm writing so what would be output of this program numbers this is the list for I numbers you know the working of for Loop this this would first of all 2 then 3 then 5 then minus 1 is 0 then 53 I adjust a variable first of all 2 would be assigned to this I then 2 will be printed then 3 would be assigned to the side and 3 would be printed same then 5 then minus 1 and 0 then 53 till the end of the list right after that it would print successfully completed see I've told you this L statement would be executed only if this for Loop has been completed successfully right it's not like that if for Loop has completely successfully then is else law could not be executed right maybe you are comparing with this if else working no that is not a case right but if somehow we break this for Loop using break we have a break keyword right break continue pass the those we will be discussing in a separate video but let me just brief you if you want to break this Loop anywhere suppose if uh I'm just printing I and if 0 sometimes if 0 is there if 0 is in the list then simply break and after that we'll be using else and this so okay then it will print two three five minus one and then one time I would be this I would be 0 so it will print 0 but now it will check if I is equal to 0 is equal to is equal to zero yes this condition is true means break break means exit from for Loop exit from this for Loop now this for Loop we have forcefully terminated is for Loop this is not complete yet right this time it will print only something like this it will not print this line successfully completed it will not hit this else block only the cell slope would be executed only and only if this Loop has been terminated successfully with all the iteration successfully right I hope you got this right means you can say uh this L says a symbol of no break if there is no break then this would be executed so symbol of like no break the successfully we have completed a for Loop that is a symbol of this the else block right so let's see this with the help of an example so let's create a new file here and that would be we'll be taking a name for underscore else Dot py and let's take a list or we can say let's take the Pulse we'll be taking a tuple like Tuple one and here Tuple should be in these uh round brackets so we'll be taking some some numbers like 256 34 3 5 and like minus one any number we can take and we simply print like 4 I in double one right so simplest example I'm going to take just print these numbers and after that in else we will simply going to print Loop has been successfully completed and we are in else block now okay let's run this and see what output you will get here 256 34 3 5 minus 1 would be printed and then this line also because this Loop has been successfully completed only then this else part would be executed if if I write something like this if I break this Loop successfully using break uh keyword we can control C break is so you can say control statement here we can control the working of Loops so I am just breaking the loop if we find like if you find like I if I is equal to is equal to suppose 5. if there is an element Phi here then break let's run this okay see now the output will be now 256 34 3 then one by one all element would be assigned to the side then 5 would be assigned so 5 would be printed then this condition this statement if I is equal to is equal to 5 yes condition is true so enter into here and here we find a break break means out of exit from the loop forcefully exit from the loop yeah you know forcefully exiting uh the control from the loop break means out of the loop means this time this else would not be executed because Loop has not been successfully completed still some iterations are left right so this else law could not be executed this time and without else if we write any statement like print and uh out of 4 else simply yeah this would be executed like 256 34 3 5 would be printed as soon as we find a five break break means out of this Loop so obviously X else would not be executed and this line would be executed out of four ends if no break if no break then also all the numbers would be printed first then successfully completed else block would be executed then this statement also executed so this else flow just simply symbolize that no break we haven't used any break in for Loop for Loop has successfully completed that's it right suppose let's take another example if I take something like this if we are finding a number is divisible by uh 6 here equal to equal to 0 how to check I hope you know then simply break at that time we'll be using break if there is a number that is divisible by 6 break right if no number suppose rather than here I am using this okay we cannot use this else here if else and here we simply print so we'll be just doing comment will be commenting out all these statements right now if a number is divisible by 6 then simply break or simply you can say print that number first and then break right let's not print any number here this is the program we have let's run this and see what output 2 will get C for every element it is saying there is no number divisible by 6 in this sequence two first time two no divisible by six then fifty six not divisible by 6 34 no divisible by 6 3 5 and minus seven right so there is no number divisible by 6 so will not enter in this statement and every time L should be executed but I don't want that for every item the cells would be executed only one time the statement would be printed right so rather than here rather than here we can use 4 else rather than if else that would be better right so here we have 4 else and this line we'll be using in this else there is no number digital by 6 in the sequence let's run this and see only one time it would be printed now maybe you are thinking we have used break here and still this else slope is executing so that is not true but what yeah we have used break here but this break has never been hit why so big is C 2 I is 2 this condition not true so obviously we are not going to enter into this for Loop so break statement would not be executed right would not be hit then for 56 also then 34 then 3 then 5 then minus 1 also this break statement is still untouched because control is not able to reach till this break statement because this condition is not true for any item this condition is you know not true so that is why this for Loop has successfully completed its working that is why we will be in else part now and it will print there is no number digital by six in the sequence I hope you now you good what is basically foreigns right there will be many situation uh in future when we'll be using the soils so I hope you got what is what else how to use foreign take care
