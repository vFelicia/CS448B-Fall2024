so in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing some special pointers in c we have discussed void null and dangling pointer now we are left with one more pointer that is wild pointer so that we will discuss in uh this video what is world pointer and what's the reason your you know program if pointer becomes wild pointer in your program we will see that thing with the help of a simple program and will also see uh when you run that program which is having a wild pointer then what kind of output you get or maybe you are getting which kind of error or warning what you get so that also will discuss practically right everything about wild quarter we will discuss in this video it's not you know that very large concept in c but it's just a simple and small concept you have to be aware about these kind of pointers right like void null dangling and while pointer so that we will discuss in this video but before that just want to tell you one thing if you are looking for a great career in software development then you must have to think about the aspects like what's trending in the industry and the type of questions being asked in the interviews how to improve your course ranking so here an academy brings you a platform where you can watch where you can get access to weekly shows which you can watch live and their host are seven star coders on code chef and are industry experts with years of experience and they are also working in some of the top companies like amazon google linkedin and in these episodes they'll be covering a lot of content that would be really helpful for your career like in live episodes you can get opportunity to ask tech hr about top 20 questions and industry leaders directly about their recruitment process in startups and mncs and what's the eligibility criteria and how to apply for them and you can also get your resume reviewed by the experts not only this you can also participate in mock interviews and learn courses on programming languages cloud computing blockchain and crypto tech aspects of digital marketing and data analytics have you ever thought about how these front line apps like amazon flip card practo ola were made in first place and what was the thought process so here is a show to answer all these questions in this show their host anuj will discuss the architecture breakdown of the popular apps so learners will get to see how these apps were made and how these apps work so you can find out the detail of the show and the batch in the link that i'll put in the description box of this video and don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get 10 extra discount on your subscription so now let's see what is wild pointer see i hope everybody know how to declare a pointer in star ptr right it's just a declaration of quantum and here it at this time what is the address in this ptr variable ptr is a variable memory has been assigned to this variable and some address would be there obviously suppose address of this pointer is 2046 and it is going to contain some address obviously pointer is a variable that is going to contain address of another variable but here i am not assigning any address here so at this time at this time it is what an initialized pointer right and if it is uninitialized then there would be some garbage value we don't know it will contain some address like we have memory if your machine is of 32 bits then the memory would be off how many bytes you will have to raise to power 32 right like numbering would be from 0 1 to each byte like this till 2 raised to power 32 these many bytes you would have so somewhere suppose somewhere in this memory four bytes has been allocated to this point the size is of four byte or obviously it depends on that um architecture of your machine right so in 32 bit four bytes so suppose four bytes means uh two zero four six is the first byte two zero four seven two zero four eight two zero four nine right obviously we will take base address so it is two zero four six of this pointer and this pointer is having what now any garbage value suppose address there is some blog whose address is suppose um 5146 and it is containing address 5146 right because we haven't assigned any address to this pointer and now if you will print this pointer like strict ptr if you want to print whatever the value at this address address is what in pti now address is 5146 now value at this address we don't know what is the value because it's not a valid address so maybe it will give some garbage value we don't know what is there at that address or maybe your program will crash so it will show some undefined behavior right we can't say what it will print because this block that this pointer is containing address of this block and this is not consumed memory we haven't reserved this memory right so it's like invalid for us we have just reserved these four bytes because we have just declare a pointer so now this memory is reserved for us uh having a base set is two zero four six right so it will give some garbage value right or maybe your program will crash so this pointer you can say this is acting as a wild pointer now you can say this is uninitialized pointer so if a pointer is uninitialized that will act as a wild pointer right so these are risky to use please don't leave any pointer uninitialized because it will give some nasty bugs in your system in your program right so now what is the solution what you can say if you don't know how to if you don't know like what address you you want to store in this pointer then simply you can say make it null pointer that we have already discussed null pointer right so now in pointer we have 0 no so it is not pointing to any valid address right and we cannot dereference this pointer further in program if you want to assign any address in this pointer you can assign like here i am taking in x is equal to 5 and here i want to assign ptr is equal to address of x so now we have one more we have some we have reserved some space for this x four bytes because it is of integer type and suppose starting address is what thousand and in x we have five so now this pointer is containing what thousand and it is now pointing to x now it is valid now it is no more a wild pointer it's like a normal pointer which is containing address of x and whenever you dereference this pointer now it will give you value at thousand that is five it will give you five right yeah this is also not wild pointer because starting we have we have made it what null pointer so it is no more a wild pointer if you leave it like this then it is wild pointer here but here it is normal pointer because you have a signed address right so one more thing what you can do if you don't want to take any variable or these kind of thing so dynamically you can allocate memory when you declare a pointer here only dynamically you can use what malloc function mellow and here you can simply write like size of end so 4 bytes would be allocated and the base address of that memory would be given to this pointer so suppose dynamically this memory has been allocated ah this memory four bytes suppose uh address is three one four six right now we don't have any x here and now it is containing three one four six so now this point is pointing to this memory right we haven't taken any variable here so directly using a strict ptr you can directly store any value here if you want to store like five so you can store here five and if you want to access your access it will print five so here it is no more a wild pointer or uninitialized pointer assuming that malloc will work fine it will not return null right so while pointer is what it is a pointer you can say uninitialized pointer or it is a pointer that is pointing to any random memory location any random memory location right and how to remove that situation either you can make pointer is equal to null pointer at starting or you can use this method dynamically when you declare pointer allocate memory right and use this use this method and third is what simply if you dynamically don't allocate memory what you can say if you take a variable like index is equal to 5 and when you declare a pointer in star ptr directly you can initialize it using address of address of operator like address of x so now here also it is not a wild pointer right there are three ways to get rid of this pointer so it's not very complicated thing it's just a simple uh you know concept you just have to know what is wild pointer like if someone say like wild pointer this is wild pointer this is dangling pointer so you must be aware about you know these pointers a little bit that's enough right so now let me show you practical on my laptop so now let me create one more file while pointer dots right we'll use that raphael also s t d l i b maybe we can use that one mellow function here right and now we will in main function i'm going to take one pointer like a strict btr right i'm not us i'm not going to assign it right ah sorry initialize it and here printf i am printing what percentage d and d reference it i'm going to dereference it so what output it will give we don't know let's see see it's giving you zero so we don't know it is pointing to any you know random memory location and accessing that memory location so maybe sometime it will clean some garbage value it depends on machine to machine and architecture to architecture maybe your program will crash or maybe it will give zero we cannot expect the output so it will it's like it will misbehave with you right because its wild pointer right now better to do what here what you can do you can write here null so make it null pointer rather than leaving it an initialized pointer right so and we cannot dereference in null point i have told you right so better to don't you know better not to dereference it because your program is going to crash now see if you dereferencing null pointer the exe file has stopped working right so now you can make it null or in starting only maybe you can take any like variable into a is equal to 9 and you can initialize this pointer straight beta is equal to address of a right and now if you will dereference it it should give you 9 because value of a is 9. see it is printing nine right or using malloc function also you can do this thing like you can do what hint this is what type casting we are type casting the pointer because malloc is going to return void pointer and we want int size of end here so here directly a strict ptr is equal to i am storing 67 suppose all right i am not taking any variable and i am now dereferencing this pointer so it should give you 67 say it is printing 67 so now these pointers are not uh wild pointer right so that's it for this video now so i hope you got what is wild pointer so in the next video we will see a different concept of c so answer in the next video till then bye
