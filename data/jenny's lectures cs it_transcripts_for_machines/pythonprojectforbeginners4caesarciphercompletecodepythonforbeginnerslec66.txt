hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of Learning Partner programming language in the previous video we have discussed what what is Caesar cycle because we are making this project Caesar Cipher right this in this series of you know python learning python this is a ports project so today we are going to implement that project so I would recommend to watch out the previous video first what you know there we have discussed what is Caesar Cipher how to implement and what kind of output I want right and pause the video right now and try this out right and if you have already tried this out it's okay now we are going to implement that project in this video okay now and I hope now you know I have told you what kind of output I want or let me just show you again what kind of output I want see first of all it should ask you type encrypt for encryption and decrypt for decryption so first of all I am going to encrypt my message what message suppose only Jenny type the shift number the shift number suppose three and see it will show here is the text after encryption mhqq B now it will ask type yes if you want to go again and otherwise no I'll type yes now I want to decrypt my message so type your message this is my message I want to decrypt this C for text so let's just copy paste this and shift number is obviously it would be same for encryption and decryption that is three and say after decryption my text is Jenny again you will ask if you want to continue or not if not then in the center no and it will say you goodbye and that's it something like this right so first what we will do obviously it should ask we will take three type of input this thing type encrypt for encryption decrypt for description this user will enter message user will enter and the shift number or the shift key user will enter these three input view on and according to the choice in crypto decrypt it will call encryption function or decryption function that's it okay okay fine now let's create a new file here so Caesar Cipher Caesar Cipher dot p y now three input we want so first thing like maybe what to do what you want to do and you can just take input you can just try and type first input is this encrypt or decrypt was what user want the user Choice then the text what text or what message you want to encrypt so suppose we take a variable text or any variable and there we will take input type your message and third is the shift key so just enter shift key and shift key is obviously integer so we are going to Typecast this into hint and this would be string this would be string so no need to type car so three input now we have now based on that which function you call encryption or decryption so you have to put a condition like if if this variable what to do what to do equal to equal to encrypt if user have typed encrypt then we will call encryption function suppose we have defined that function yeah I know till we haven't defined that function so directly we are going to call so we'll call a function encryption and what we pass an encryption the text you want to encrypt the message and the shift key two things so I am passing what only text and shift these two things okay but L if this what to do equal to equal to suppose decrypt then we will call suppose we have a decryption function decryption and same we will pass text and this shift two cases right now let's define these two function encryption and decryption functions so before calling we have to Define so first we will Define encryption function so the same name encryption two argument it should take so encryption will take a plain text and convert into ciphertext so suppose it will accept a plain text not suppose yeah it will accept a plain text so suppose we are taking argument plane sorry underscore text and shift key these two variable name I'm taking right so okay let's suppose rather than just positional argument better to pass keyword argument right so we will take here plain text equal to text and the shift key equal to shift right for this positional argument we will you know uh sorry the the keyword argument will pass but when we will Define that decryption function then we'll pass right so now in encryption you have to apply the formula what is the formula basic one what you have to find out like we have a list obviously we have to take a list first of all the alphabets a b c d like this right so let's take a list first of all okay now we have a list of alphabet having all the 26 letters or alphabets right so first thing what we have like the index or the position of these alphabet is from 0 to 25 right so the shift key is suppose I am passing a message like hello so for H for H the number is here 7. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so correct it's seven and suppose the shift key is three so in encryption it should give 7 plus 3 is 10 at 10 we have 7 8 9 10 K so it will replace this H with k right okay you know the formula so first you have to you know find out this index of this letter H the index is seven or you can see the position right how to find out the index we have a function in list index function how to call that function C suppose we have passed a message helper for each letter we are going to find out the index right so let's put it a for Loop for in plain text plain text is hello so first time in care H would be assigned for H we are going to find the position equal to how to use that index function just first of all the index function is of list on list we are using that index function so list name is alphabet Dot C you can see that this is the index function index and for what letter you want to find out the index the letter is in care now first in care we have H now in position right now we are having seven right so in position we will be adding position plus shift key right so new position new position is equal to this position plus whatever the shift key whatever the shift key so 7 plus 3 is now 10 right now at 10 what letter we have that you have to access now right so how to access that letter and that letter we are going to obviously we are going to create a new string empty string first here suppose C for text is equal to empty string because whatever the text would be there after encryption that would be known as C4 text so right now C for text is empty so first in C for text we are going to add plus equal to at new position whatever the letter is so how to access at new position is 10 how to access that thing just pass the list name and in index or in the subscript just passed new position so whatever the like Revenue position that would be added to now see for text so at first K would be added to C for text right now again we are in for Loop so next character is e now in care we have e so for E first of all we will find out the position then new position after adding the shift key after like once the for Loop is complete till we have done till o h e l l o now we are out of the loop and we are just going to print the C for text so what we will print like here is the text after encryption and the that in the variable C for text we are having that text right so I think encryption is done okay it's not like you know the final one little bit we are going to update but I'll show you that thing also when we are going to update so I think now we are thinking we are done with encryption right okay let's call this let us comment comment out these two lines first like we are just going to call encrypt encryption right okay I don't know it will work or not let's run this and let's see so we have only encrypt function type your message h e l l o hello shift key is suppose three so see the text after encryption is k h o o r now manually you can write down all the alphabet ABCD on a piece of paper just assign 0 1 2 3 4 like this and just trying to convert right but the problem is you will get k h o r but the problem is let's run this again encrypt and hello is our key suppose or suppose Jen is early so see why for y the index is 24. and the shift key if I provide three so for why it's 24 24 plus 3 27 but in index we are not having any letter at 27. so what it will give C list out of index range index out of range error so how to solve this problem this is one thing if the letters are more towards the end like towards Z so after Z after 25 where you will go okay this is the problem so we should so this should be something like this Y is 24 24 plus 3 is 27 so we are in like a loop after Z we want again we should go to a so if we add plus 3 then y should be 1 2 3 it should be B it should be replaced with B okay so for this thing what you need to do see I have told you the formula it should be X Plus n mode 26. right because within 26 letter you have to be there within 26 letters within the range of 0 to 25 you cannot go out of that okay that is the you can say limitation of Caesar Cipher so here you have to do in the formula mode 26 modulo operator 26. now let's run this same encrypt messages suppose Jenny shift key is 3 C mhqq B now B is converted to Y is converted to B because we have handled the situation also with mode 26 exact formula we have applied right and that also work in those cases if shift key is very large if shift key is more than 25 or more than 26 so 50 is 30 right so with mode 26 that would be within 26 only okay yeah if you are not applying here mode 26 let's suppose again run this and encrypt and hello shift K suppose 30. see same list out of index range although letters are not more towards z l l o but the key is 30. now H is at seventh position 7 plus 30 is 37. but how to access we we are not having any index 37 in our list we are having from 0 to 25. so to limit that index from 0 to 25 within those 26 letters you have to use mode function right so this thing is very important you need to take care here more twenty six now this will work okay so I hope now you got how to define this encryption function now you will not face much difficulties while defining decryption function it would be almost same so let's just copy paste this thing okay now rather than encryption just change decryption and decryption is what it will convert ciphertext to plain text so it will accept the input ciphertext so rather than the argument name plain text just give it C for text or you can give plain text also that is also fine but for understanding because encryption will convert plane to Cipher so it will accept plain text and give you ciphertext decryption will convert Cipher to plane so it will accept ciphertext and give you plain text that is why I am just taking otherwise you can take any argument name it's up to you so and shift key that's it and here we are taking plain text because finally we will get plain text so for care in not plain text in Cipher text Karen ciphertext so if this is hello and the key is 3 then Cipher text would be k h o o r now first of all care in care we are having k so here care is equal to K first so just find out the position of this k now position of K is or the index of K is using index we can just find out the same thing this time would not be changed so for K the position is 10. Now new position would be we are going to shift now backward while decryption so you have to do position minus shift e rather than Plus minus shift key and obviously mode 26 would be there why what is the signification or significance of this mode 26 I have told you right but here minus 26 sorry minus shift key then in plain text we will add plus equal to this alphabet what is the alphabet at new position so okay it's 10 10 minus 3 is 7 so at 7 what is the letter H so H would be added to plain text at first and same would be repaid for k then H then oor and finally you will get hello after this for Loop we are just going to print here is the text after decryption and this is what in the variable name is plain text okay so now we can call we can just remove these so else if this is what to do is decrypt just call decryption okay let's run this although it's not correct but let's run this and I will first decrypt decrypt type your message was khoor for hello encryption so it will give you hello but it should repeat now see it is going to end process finished but it should repeat until we enter no right so for that you have to put a loop or you can say for how many times it should repeat these things encryption decoration we don't know so the best Loop is while loop if you don't know the number of iteration so okay so all these things you have to put in a while loop because then again again we are asking what to do indicator decrypt message then shift key then call encryption and decryption so put this in while loop but what is the stopping condition when you have to stop I don't know the number of iteration fixed iteration so let's we will give a simple any variable and say a flag that should be true first always true but once something happens within this body of the while loop we will flip that flag to false and then exit from the loop so what variable M you can take any variable you variable you can take I just wanna take wanna and variable name wanna add or end of the program or you can say end or you can see any variable you can take a b c or also you can take but just for understanding purpose I am taking one and is equal to at first for false because we I'm not gonna I'm not gonna and I don't want to end my program right now so it should be false first so while not want to add so at first it is false not false is true so true means we are going to enter into this while loop so this all this this thing should be indented now but when to stop this while loop if in that output if user enter no then we will stop so you have to ask from the user one more input you have to take for that input just take a variable name let's I'm taking like a variable in play again okay so play again and with input function will take input from the user so in this variable we will just take input type yes to continue and type no to exit we will ask from the user right and we will check if if this play again this variable equal to equal to if it's a no no same letter you have to write down like n or no is in lower letter so here also n o lowercase letter not capital letter it is K sensitive so if it's a no then we are going to flip that variable that's 1 and equal to true and just in case you can just print a message here like have a nice day and bye in if so see one end is equal to True next time not true is equal to false and we are will be exit from this while loop right so this is how you can control this thing okay let's run this and see what output you will get let's run this encrypt type your message it is hello shift key is suppose three then we've got CS to continue node to exit yes I want to decrypt now messages k h o r shift key should be same 3 and decryption is hello and if I press no exit have a nice day bye but the problem here is what if I just enter the text like maybe hello space one two three or any symbol in that case what will happen see messages hello space one two three and then assemble and Jenny shift key is three see the space value error is not in the list because you are prodding space then one two three then this is this and enlist in alphabet list we are having only a to z so now it is giving error but it should not give any error because whatever you will enter another other than these alphabet it should give you it will give you as a tease like hello then space should be as it is and one to three would be as it is and whatever the alphabet that will be converted into C vertex cyber text so for that you have to put a condition if condition C see first of all let's update this encryption so for care in plain text so we have to find out we have to apply this formula only if if the character in this list alphabet then only apply this formula so just put this this formula within this if right then for this if we'll put an else else as it is whatever they are one two three if here we have space and one two three so this one two three would be added as it is to the C for text so else this Cipher text becomes plus equal to we are going to add the character as it is to this Cipher text and same in decryption for carrying ciphertext you have to put if condition if the square in membership operator in alphabet in this playlist then only apply this formula okay else as it is you have to put so in plain text we are going to put that character whatever the character is it's either a space or one two three or anything any special symbol put as it is to the plain text and that's it let's run this see encrypt messages suppose hello one two three with at the rate with Jenny would be converted to mhuqb right if you want to continue yes and suppose shift key is now again I want to encrypt a message like hello one two three this time hello Jenny like this and shift key is 30 this point of time greater than 26. let's run this yeah it will convert lips one two three and I rrc because we have done mode 26 so this will also work okay let's press no and exit or if you want to decrypt you can just enter decrypt and this text you can copy paste you can paste and shift keyword should be same 30 and it will give you hello one two three gen so that's it I guess now you got this is not so tough Caesar Cipher or the second case is rather than two you have to Define here two functions rather than definition two functions of definition you can just put all the things in one function also right because see all the lines are almost same this the formula the main formula is almost same but just here we have plus here we have minus so this you have to operate a little bit right now what you can do let me just show you this thing also just you have to update a little bit like you can put if it is a decryption then you can do what thing you can do what you can just do this shift key into minus 1. rather than this you can say shift key equal to shift key into minus 1. shift key equal to shift key into minus 1. because shift key is three in clip for encryption it would be same but if it is a decryption if decrypt if user has Type decrypt then just have to apply shift key is equal to shift key into minus one then it will become minus and then you can simply if you add you have to put this formula only position plus shift key but if decryption shift key becomes minus 3 suppose three then minus 3 so it will become plus minus three so automatically it will be minus three so I have just give you the hint you just modify this thing Define just only one function within same function you have to put this type of condition if this what to do this variable is because you will pass what to do also you have to pass rather than just two here also you can pass like I have told you that keyword keyworded argument so this C for text is equal to text and shift key equal to shift rather than 2 you have to pass three argument this what to do also right and for that you have to accept here what to do you can say the say the direction and if the direction is equal to is equal to decrypt just put this thing otherwise you have to put this formula only same and one more thing see alphabets we have taken only small letters we have taken so if you type a message in capital letter that also will give you error so what we can do whenever you will type the text whenever you will take input from the user at that time only convert that thing into lowercase letter using this function lower so whatever you will type this will convert into lower case so okay let's run this and I'll show you what output you will get there say first we will encrypt and Capital hello small hello like one two three he will be again shift key suppose this time seven so see both caps hello and small Hello both are converted into same ciphertext o and SSV right go to exit no uh sorry type node to exit yeah no means now we are out from the sector let's run this again and this time encrypt like hello hello one two three suppose we have 10 minutes letters shift K this time is 10. 3 same this symbol same and this is the so now I want to contain vs I want to decrypt so the message is this one so let's just copy paste to this thing this is the message and key should be same 10 sing hello hello one two three Jenny's lectures okay now no to exit so exactly right okay now first of all you have to try this out if you are not getting this because I don't think so we will you're going to have any problem because that's very simple but if you're still you are not getting this how to do this thing you can ask me in comment section okay now that's it for this video the Caesar Cipher project right now if you haven't get this thing it's okay just write down that this thing all the formula that you know the code on a paper piece of paper like this right and take a message like hello and manually just run that program manually then definitely you will get it right how it is the working of this program okay now in the next video we'll see you dictionaries one also next to it will go bye take care
