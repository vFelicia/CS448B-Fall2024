hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing Turtle Graphics in the previous video we have seen one coding excise based onal Graphics right so now it's time to make a project based on this see till now we have seen only what one turtle on our screen so maybe this question has been arised in your mind also like can we have more than one Turtle the force we can have so in this video we are going to make a project of you you can say it's kind of turtle race right and at last it will show who the the winner right let me show you what kind of thing I want so whenever you run that project it will ask first of all how many turtles you want to raise like obviously a range any range you can take obviously one Turtle if there is one Turtle there would be no race so at least two turtle and maximum we can take five seven 8 10 15 many turtles so 2 to 10 let's take only three Turtles okay whenever you will enter so there is a screen having three Turtles right and they are going to move at some I don't know at which speed or how you going to implement I don't know but every turtle is having see different color one is red green this one is I guess pink or something like this and at last the winner after reaching to here to this line it will show the winner is pink color turtle or something like this you can show right so this thing you have to implement right now just pause the video and maybe you can try this out or if you are not able to do the complete project at one time so let's divide this thing like how to first you just have to uh work on the this thing how many turtles you want this thing how you are going to input how you going to take user input so this thing work on this thing then have to create multiple Turtles till now we have created one Turtle only so do that part create try to create multiple turtles Right obviously that those would be by default of same color black color after that try to change the color of those Turtles right then move the turtle because at first Turtle would be here at the center of the screen at 0 coordinate so you have to move these three Turtles here right facing upward so this thing now you need to do next part is now think of moving these Turtles further right at random speed and then finally how to reach how you will get to know that the turtle has reached to the finished line this thing you need to take care right you have to think and then whatever the color of that turtle you have to return right one more thing you need to take care here is here we have three turtles so these are see at equal spacing right from the border as well as in between these Turtles there is equal spacing if I see let me show you if I run this again and this time I enter five Turtle so see we have five turtle at equal spacing right so Winer is red color like this so the spacing also how you are going to allocate this is important one I guess this is complex also if you are you know good in mathematics in these XY coordinates right in understanding these coordinate system and in maths if you're good then easily you can do this spacing kind of thing equal spacing right from the border as well as in between the turtle right so you can just pause the video and try this out so we are going to create a new project right Turtle uncore race fine and now under this project let's create a new file and that would be only one file suppose main. py that's it right okay first thing we will do how to take input from the user you know you have an input function so let's take a variable suppose count and or any variable you can take and how many total you want to participate in the race right so let's just convert this into obviously you have to convert this into int because whatever you will take using input function that would be considered as string so let's take this it into convert this into int now you have to check maybe if these this count is not between 2 and 10 then ask again right so so if this count is within the range then you can either print or let's return count okay so let's define this thing in a let's take a function def number of totals see you can write down the code without any without function or all simple line by line but to manage the code or to look or code better better to use some function functions so that like this function is for number of total this function is for the race this function is for this so that we can easily manage our code and if any other is going to you know look at our code going to read our code then it would be understandable for them also okay this function number of turtle okay this is going to you know find out or this is going to find out or Define the number of turtles like this so better to use these approaches to look our C better right so let's define a function number of t and if this is within the range then return count right else sorry else let's just print a message input is not in the given range and try again right so try again try again means it should again Ask how many turtles you want to participate right so we are going to put this thing in a while loop how many time you know how many times this this is going to be asked from the user how many Turtle you want to participate in the race we don't know how many times because once you run this you will enter suppose one so again it will ask now you enter 11 again it will ask now you enter maybe 50 again it will ask so as long as you enter invalid input it is going to ask you so we don't know the number of iteration so here if you don't know the number of iteration then better to use their while loop so while true and this and if you to make sure count is at least at first zero so just initialize this with zero right else this and again while is true so it is going to again repeat this thing and if the count is within the range then it is going to return count and out of this function right so to execute this function you have to call this function so it is going to and uh you know a return number of turtles return the count so let's take a variable Turtles and let's call this function number of turtle here right and if you want to print then you can print here Turtles see no do not take only Turtle because turtle is name of the module so please don't take variable name turtle turtles is fine so let's run this and see okay one thing is it asking how manys you want to participate in the race and I'm entering here suppose one input is not in given range try again so again it is asking suppose 89 again it is asking this time suppose three that's it because we have implemented this thing only okay one part is done now create number of turtles how many Turtle whatever Turtle you will enter those much turtle you have to create right so how to create Turtle first let's import from Turtle module we are going to import Turtle class because we have to create objects obviously using this op approach only we can create multiple objects we can have multiple turtles in one screen right and let's create our own screen as well so our screen class we have right and definitely here we need a random kind of thing also so let's import random module also right okay now if you want to create a turtle suppose to so this is the syntax right to Turtle this then we want to move this Turtle first of all change the direction left 90° so Tom dot left to the angle 90° and then where you want to move this Turtle Tom Dot see if you have this screen right and suppose we know the measurement of the screen 400 width 400 height let's suppose if you know the width and height then easily we can play with these coordinate system right so first of all better to set width and height so let's take some constant 400 comma 400 both the things width and height 400 400 right so one more thing we need to do let's create a screen as well after checking the turtle before creating Turtle let's create a screen S1 equal to screen right and I also set the by default the size of the screen is 400 and 300 so we want to set 400 400 so let's set so see we have a method specific to screen setup method right set the size and position of the main window right so you have to give width and height or you can also give like start X and start y just to set the position also but we will just give two thing only width and height right so first was width and second was height 400 comma 400 or rather than these positional argument you can give keyword argument also like width is equal to 400 height is equal to 400 to you know make it more understandable so this is width this is height of our screen it's small S one so suppose we have a screen this 400 400 and by default at first a turtle would be here at 0 0 coordinate right so this this is what y AIS and this is what xais right so here we have 0 0 so this side we have this coordinate would be xais is 200 + 200 here we have + 200 and this side we will be having Min 200 this side 200 same this coordinate here Y is + 200 this side and here Y is 200 the total is here so let's first we are going to tilt turn the left uh turn this Turtle to left 90° and then we are going to move the Turtle here here so here at this boundary y would be same if we have three Turtle then one Turtle would be I want to place here one Turtle here and next here at equal spacing and equal spacing from the border also right so for both the three turtles if suppose we have three Turtle then x coordinate is changing and y coordinate is 00 only because here Y is 200 only I hope you know XY coordinate coordinate system a little bit idea of this thing right but why is changing suppose if we have three Turtle then this is complete this is width is 400 so this horizontal is xais so we are going to divide this into 1 2 3 four parts if three Turtle then divide this into four parts to put these turtle in equal spacing in between the turtle as well as from the boundaries if you divide this into three parts then something like this one then two then three part so one Turtle would be here one Turtle would be here and one Turtle would be here one turtle is at this border only but we don't want this thing you want spacing from border also so if three Turtle then divide this into four part if you have five Turtle then or four Turtle then one Turtle we are going to place here one here one here and one something like here in that case this would be divided into five part 1 2 3 4 five five part so four total divide this into five part so I hope you got this point you have to divide this spacing X spacing between the turtle because this is xaxis for this spacing would be equal divided this this width divided by number of total + one three total then divide this into four part four total divide this into five part for equal spacing right I hope you got this thing and after that just change x coordinate and y coordinate would be fix now how to decide that x coordinate that also I'll show you so first let's suppose like uh X spacing that spacing that would be whatever the width divide by or let's take flow division because this is going to or it is integer division it's going to round that answer to the whole number so flow division by number of turtles plus one so number of turtle are in this variable turtles so Turtles plus one but you have to put this thing into bracket so this is X speed faing right this thing I hope you got okay now let's create many turtles so how many Turtle you want to create whatever Turtle you will enter those many turtles right so for that obviously we need a for Loop so four suppose I in Turtles Turtle says suppose I have entered three so here sorry this should be what obviously range and turtles or range we will take from one to if you take one two turtles suppose we have three turtles so 1 2 3 so it will generate only 1 comma 2 because whatever the last minus one range is going to generate but we want three turtle so if you enter three total it will generate only one and two two numbers so here you have to do plus one also to generate the number equal to the number of turtles so 1 2 Turtle + 1 if you take this from Zer then you can take 0 two turtle that is fine so 0 1 2 if you have three Turtles right but why we are taking one that also I'll show you right so here we are going to create Turtle now right so rather than giving a specific name to the total because every turtle is like something different and we are going to make a list of turtles so first let's create Turtle underscore list let's create an empty list Turtle uncore list and let's what we'll do create a totle upend to the list create a totle upend to the list right so rather than giving a specific name new better to take new Turtle new turtle is equal to Turtle right and let's create shape also soorry change the shape to turtle and now have to set these two equal spacing so new turtle dot if you want to move a turtle from that z0 location to any other location we we know we have a function go to or set position or set P so you have to give only XY coordinates see y coordinate is same it's 00 for all the turtles so 200 means whatever the height because this vertical line is y coordinate whatever the height divide by two or if you want to put the uh these Turtle a little bit you know at some distance from this line because if you put at the edge of the screen then maybe half turtle would be not visible to you right so we can do like y coordinate would be first we will decide y coordinate so y coordinate is in minus because we are downward from zero to downward so that is minus so minus whatever the height flow division um two because divided by two height 0 to half up half down so divided by 2 plus plus 10 or 20 pixel up from that boundary if you want to give you can give plus like 10 pixel or if you take minus height divid by 2 that is also fine 200 also you can take that is also fine right so this is is y coordinate I hope you got this is y coordinate y this is y coordinate now x coordinate how to decide x coordinate if we have three Turtle then something like this 1 2 3 three Turtles would be there so y coordinate for all the turtle is 200 but x coordinate for this turtle is if you think if you you know assume or if you figure out this thing then it would be around like 100 right and y coordinate is 200 for this x is 0 and Y is 200 for this x is 100 and Y is 200 for equal spacing obviously and because this complete is 400 xais is 400 right so this is zero this is almost in between this 200 so minus 100 this is 100 so this spacing is important the spacing is 100 because if you have three Turtle then how to how to find out the SP X spacing that width is 400 this width is 400 divide by flow division by number of total plus one so divide by 4 3 + 1 is 4 so it would be 100 so the spacing is 100 100 100 100 if you have four total then it would be divided by five and the spacing would be 80 so one total would be here something like this second third and fourth like this it would be like it it's at 120 x coordinate for this totle it's 40 x coordinate for this totle 40 for this turle 120 like this right so how to decide this x coordinate the width IDE by 2 right plus plus obviously spacing is important for this then plus this spacing x coordinate plus this spacing next x coordinate for the turtle plus this spacing this coordinate so obviously you have to do plus some spacing but spacing you have to multiply that spacing with the number of total for first second third fourth C something like this and that would be minus width Flor division it's two plus whatever the turtle the number of turtle 1 2 3 4 so at first we have first turtle in I we have first so here we will take I that is why I have taken here I sorry one two Turtle plus one not 0 two turtles because if you take zero at first it would be zero and I would be zero but there is no zero turtle turtle would be 1 2 3 4 like this so if you take a zero Turtle then that that the this side of turtle the uh this side Turtle would be here but I don't want to place this at this boundary with some spacing here I want to place that is why I'm taking first at first one first second third four not zero so I into whatever the X spacing right let's multiply this so see if if the turtle is see width is let me just show you this thing x coordinate for first Turtle so width is 400 so 400 floor divide 2 then plus I is 1 for first Turtle into X spacing is what 100 if the total are three the X spacing is 100 so 100 so if you calculate this thing then 200 + 100 it would be 100 so for first Turtle x coordinate is 100 that's exactly we want for second Turtle rather than one now at I we have two 200 + 200 second turtle is that for x coordinate is zero y coordinate is same 200 that's exactly want for third Turtle into three so 200 + 300 it's + 400 so 100 and 200 that's exactly we want 100 200 right so this is the formula to calculate x and y coordinate if you're not getting this pause the video and just write down this formula just on a pen and paper just draw XY coord take the screen and dry run this thing calculate the spacing and width XY coordinate for taking different different number of Turtles 3 4 5 six something like this then definitely you will get it right it's simple math okay now if I run this let's run this how many Turtle three so we have a screen okay obviously you have to hold the screen so for that at last you will be S1 do exit on click okay let's run this how many total three see so let's just make the screen something like this then you will get it so 1 2 3 turtle at equal spacing so you don't want to draw this line so what we can do pen up we can do very simple so before moving just do new turtle dot pen up that's it let's suppose we have six Turtle this time let's run this and we have six Turtle this time so this is the screen okay now we have six Turtle but you will see like here from the boundaries we have more spacing so this is because I'm just increasing the this uh size of this screen by just dragging this something like this but actual screen size is here only 400 by 400 right okay this thing we know uh sorry we have done now the colors of the turtles so let's take colorless colorless first so we have a color list I'm having some color at least 10 color you need because maximum total you can take is 10 so at least 10 colors you need right so let's take a color list of 10 colors and now you have to so new turtle dot color we can take from the color list and according to the because that is a list so we can access with the help of Index right so index just provide I value so if the turtle are three then 1 2 and three would be generated at first in I we have one so colorless one colorless one is red sorry one is green because the list index would be started from zero so if you want to take this zero also then you can take i one so I at first would be 1 so 1 1 is zero so first would be red then I is two then 2 1 is one then second toal would be green third toal would be pink or randomly you can also choose random dot choice and in bracket you can just give color list that is also fine so let me just show you run this and let's take suppose six Turtle see you have seen the color of the turtle according to here first was red then green then pink yellow like this right now we are going to move these Turtles randomly with some pixels I don't know because some turtle is moving moving fast some are moving slow so maybe some turtle one turtle is moving with one pixel at one time another is moving with five pixel one is moving with six pixel like this so randomly you have to decide that distance it's not like that just do new turtle do forward with some specific uh that uh pixel 1 2 3 10 20 no randomly you have to choose so the distance would be random right okay so this for Loop is fine till now we are done so out of this for Loop directly you can write down the racing logic or you can just Define a function race that would be better if you define a function the code would would be more organizable right manageable So Def race let's find out distance is equal to I want to Generate random dot in what range Rand range one to suppose 20 1 to 20 pixel any number 1 to 20 any number that would be distance right and now this Turtle would be moving by this distance so like turtle or dot dot forward by this distance right all the turtles fine so obviously you have to put this thing into a loop right so for turtle in this Turtle list right because obiously we can iterate a list that is why we have created a list and we have appended all all the turtle to this list right so for turtle in this Turtle list let's find out the distance here random do Rand range by this and then that turtle dot forward with this distance with that random number right something like this but when to stop so you have to call this race function to execute this so let's call this race function but we want this to be continued till that Finish Line right so we just take a while loop because we don't know the exact number of iteration while true right or we can just me uh take a flag variable as race on is equal to True at first it's true right so while is race on while true till then it would be repeated right this thing would be repeated so if you run the something like this then while race on it's always true so obviously you have to change this to false you have to flip this flag variable to exit from this Loop right so what you need to do you have to find out if the turtle is moving see from this side to this side so the finish line is this line so at this point of time at this point of time the y coordinate is 200 so you have to check check the y coordinate if the turtle has reached this y coordinate plus 200 because here the y coordinate was 200 if it has reached to plus 200 then stop and that would be the winner right so first you have to find out the x and y coordinate of these Turtles and for that we have a method P let me just show you see tell Turtle State it's position or p s it is going to return turtle's current location x and y coordinate right so yeah that's exactly we want so X comma y two coordinate we want is equal to whatever the turtle turtle dot P this thing we want and then we check if that y coordinate y coordinate is greater than or equal to what the height flooor division 2 400 by 2 that is 200 means you have to do is RA so is equal to F you have to flip this variable to stop this while loop right and before that let's print one line the winner is and whatever the color we have right now of that turtle so for that you have to use F string and we'll fetch the color using using the turtle dot because here we have or rather than Turtle we just take suppose I I'm going to take T so that is also fine here you can take T do forward by this distance and we want T do position and the winner is T dot if you you want to print T do color winner is this color Turtle when is this turtle or when is like pink turtle or yellow turtle something like this okay so if I run this and uh let's take we have six Turtles right so these Turtles are not moving so definitely there is something wrong in our code let me just see or maybe if you have just figured out you can just comment out this thing like what is the problem why this is not moving it is not responding let's close the program and three let's see okay this would be 14 total list okay still the turtle list is empty because we haven't appended a turtle in the list so Turtle list dot a pend and whatever the turtle you have created new turtle because obviously that is important now because we are using this Turtle list here to Loop through for this this thing right okay this time I hope this will work fine let's run and let's suppose we have only three Turtles this time okay they're moving and the winner is see now the winner is obviously that was Green Turtle so green green turtle two time it is printing see the turtle green turtle is out of our range if you not able to see now it's visible right so obviously the winner is Green Turtle but it what it is printing green green turtle why two time green green okay let's see okay because we are printing T dot color and if you see if you see this thing the this color method see Turtle do color so it is going to return the current pen color and current fill color as a pair of color specification so return or set pen color and fill color two color it will return pen color as well as fill color but I want only pen color so better to use here T dot pen color now let's run this and let's take only this time also three Turtles and okay they're moving and this time also winner is now see green turtle as we know from this also we can see the winner is Green Turtle so that is not visible so better to write down this thing Al if Y is greater than equal to height divide by 2 means 200 not 200 because that would be proper boundary 200 20 pixel right that is I guess will work fine so let's run this again and again they're moving okay this time winner is this pink turtle pink turtle yeah it's seen so you can do here 20 orus 30 right see so this is how we can do like the turtle race kind of thing or you can just play around with this code and you can just make it more sophisticated and more maybe like more colorful or more uh complex type of thing because it is simple one but one thing we have like if you enter by default if I run this and intentionally I enter here a rather than any number so it will just give any my value error but I want it should print like invalid input please try again or you have to enter only numeric value please try again this kind of thing right so this also we can check rather than converting this into here int whatever you will enter first check if the count is we function is digit it will return true if you will enter digit right whatever you will enter that is a digit 1 2 3 4 5 something like this right if this is a digit then convert then convert this count into int right if not else print a error message please enter a numeric value between 2 to 10 this kind of thing it should give and here we can do like from here only I want from this only it will again Ask how many Turtle you want to participate rather than execute this F Els right so yes we have a keyword continue if you use it continue from this line only it will again go to the at the very first line of the loop right rather than again checking this F else because obviously no need to check this F else if the count is not a digit right let's run this and see what is happening if I enter here a see please enter a numeric value between 2 to 10 again it is asking I'm entering H again it is asking I'm entering one again input is not in given range try again if I enter here seven yeah that is fine now you can see the turtle are moving so the winner is pink turtle right and as you can see the winner is pink turtle right so I guess that was not tough one it's easy one so if you want want this this code then you can I'll just copy paste this thing in description right or maybe in the I'll pin the com comment fine or if you want this code like in any other way you can let me know in comment section fine so I hope you got this project this kind of project you can just work on these kind of projects right these are beginner project for beginners right okay in the next video we'll see higher order function right and then or maybe we'll see one more project first right then we will see high order function so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
