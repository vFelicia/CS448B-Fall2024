nta ugc net paper one some students take it lightly and some students think that it is very tough so if you fall in either of these categories you are wrong do not take it very lightly and don't think that it is very tough subject because see some students uh think that general uh paper is there means apt equations and research application technical aptitude type of questions are there and so it's better to prepare more it's better to focus more on subject specific like paper two yeah it's good to focus more on paper too because that is having 200 marks and paper one is of 100 marks but see if you have studied very hard if you have prepared very well then i guess you can you can get 150 marks in paper too it's very tough to get 150 plus marks in paper too for that you will have to you know work hard you will have to study very well but if you put some efforts in paper one in preparing paper one if you study smartly i'm not saying you have to work hard you have to study very hard for paper one if you study smartly for paper 1 then easily you can get 70 plus marks so you can get a very good score if you focus on paper 1 a little bit do not ignore this paper some students think what they just focus on paper 2 subjects and at last they think that in 10 to 15 days they'll cover paper one yeah you can cover paper one in those days but you are not able to get you know 70 plus marks in paper one there are some units which require regular practice like di or reading comprehension it's not like that you can prepare all the units very well in last 10 to 15 days it would be you know pressure for you at that time so it's better to start preparation for paper one with paper two like three or four months before your exam so in this video i'm going to discuss some tips how to get 70 plus score in paper one how to study smartly for paper one but before that just want to tell you one thing for net aspire and suggested aspirants an academy has started a paper analysis series it is

the enrollment link i'll give you in the description box of this video you can go and check out there so now let us discuss some tips to get a very good score in paper one before that let us discuss what is this labels for paper one i hope everybody is aware about there are 50 questions and 100 marks and 10 units are there so these are 10 units so if you want to get a very good score in paper 1 at least try to attempt at least try to aim for 30 to 35 questions do not aim to solve 50 questions correctly yeah you have to attempt all the questions because there is no negative marking right but it's not like that i will i am supposed to attempt all the 50 questions correctly according to that i'll read if you will do this thing if you are aiming for 50 questions correctly then you will dedicate more time in these subjects and from these subjects i think like people and environment higher education government and quality from these units very unpredictable questions they can ask sometimes and tricky questions can be there right so it's not possible to attempt all the 50 questions correctly keep this thing in your mind you should study like that you can attempt 35 questions correctly right so from each unit 5 questions they ask sometimes uh uh from research aptitude like six questions and from teaching attitude four questions from sometimes from teaching four questions like six questions and from there four questions this happens but on an average five questions from each unit so each unit is having equal weightage don't think it is not important just leave it no from each unit they'll ask five question on an average so what you can do you can prepare what seven units very well but before starting your preparation one thing you can do what just take previous requestion paper and try to solve paper one right and at that time you will figure out which type of questions are very tough for you which type of questions you can solve because see from these units some type of questions require only common sense like in my opinion teaching aptitude questions require only common sense and some questions are very easy like from ict and from communication easy type of questions they ask so you can easily solve those questions without actually preparation without actually preparing these units so find out first of all that thing and find out your strong points there and weak points there like which type of questions you are not able to solve you are you don't even think how to solve that question right so focus on those units first and if you are good at particular unit it's not like that just leave it you have to study that unit also it is just to analyze yourself first right your strength your weakness and then start preparation at least six to seven units you should prepare very well now you can decide which unit you want to prepare i would suggest do not leave teaching aptitude ict research aptitude communication and these also if you are good at practical subjects or at numbers if you are good you know have good logical thinking in that time you can you should not leave these subjects and this is also easy reading comprehension yeah it will take time but you if you practice one comprehension daily like before three or four months before your exam you will be good at this thing also and see here also five questions would be there but two questions are very easy i have observed the pattern from five questions two to three or you i would say minimum two questions would be very easy definitely you are able to solve without any preparation even without any preparation for reading comprehension you can easily solve two questions one or two question would be average and one question is difficult type of question so if you practice for this reading comprehension you can easily solve four questions but if you don't practice then also you can solve two question right but you have to practice for di for data interpretation type of questions because at the time of exam 50 questions and 60 minutes so these type of questions require a lot of time if you don't practice very much right but if you are good in di concepts in these type of questions and if you have practiced very well like three or four months you have practiced all the questions so easily you can attempt three questions easily three equations out of five questions same pattern two question would be very easy one or two would be average and one would be difficult so easily you can solve three three to four if you have practiced very well right and from these topics from these units generally tricky questions they ask or sometimes unpredictable questions can be asked you have no clue about that maybe regarding current affairs and all gk they'll check your general awareness and it is very tough to read all the current affairs yeah for this thing what you can do you can make a habit of reading newspaper or watching news that would be sometimes beneficial for to solve these kind of questions but do not put very much time very much you know hard work very much efforts in preparing these subjects rather than this i would suggest practice reading comprehension and di equations and these reasoning question maths and logical reasoning question suppose if you are not good in logical reasoning question or any reasoning which includes math question but still there are some sub topics in which you are good like maybe uh coding and decoding type of questions you can solve easily maybe you are good at blood relations you can easily understand maybe you are good at those direction questions right so you can prepare those sub topics very well so that if any question comes from these topics you can attempt very easily in less time so my second tip is what do not leave any unit completely there are still some topics some sub topics in which you are good prepare those topics or subtopics or what you can do analyze previous year question paper according to that find out from which topic generally they ask question every year which type of question and prepare those topics right and third tip is what take previous year question paper ten year question paper so at least six to seven year at least and try to sort those question paper sorting means what if suppose you have taken seven year question papers passed so what you have fourteen question paper you have right and every year they ask you know five question from each unit so 5 14 into 5 for each unit you have how many questions total 70 questions for each unit so what you will do take a separate notebook and in that notebook start subjectwise unit wise like your search aptitude and note down all the questions 70 questions then teaching aptitude note down all the 70 questions like this for all the units and now try to solve all the questions like now try to analyze which type of questions they ask from which type of from which topics from which sub topic they ask question like uh let us take in communication generally they ask question every time from communication models communication models are very important so do not leave this topic so this is the benefit of solving previous year question paper you will come to know which sub topic is important which topic is important in these units so focus on on that topic very much focus study that topic in a way that any question will ask from then they ask from that topic and you will attempt that question next step is follow the study materials or maybe you are following if suppose video tutorials then follow that study material from one trusted resource only one do not just go here and there like from this youtube channel from this youtube channel or from you have borrowed notes from your friends also and you have purchased study material of any coaching institute also and you are as well as following some books some text books for paper one no it is going to confuse you only paper 1 is not very tough it is comparatively comparatively very easy than paper 2. so you have to study less but you have to study what is important you have to study smartly if you have collected material from suppose three to four resources you have this video tutorial you have this video tutorial you have your friends notes you have purchased from any coaching institute you have books also then which resource from which resource you will refer you will get confused so from whatever study material you are preparing just stick to that for revision also and for your preparations also and next i have already told you do not waste much time on current affairs and general awareness type of things i'm not saying that justly we do not focus on current affairs yes you must read newspaper you must watch new channels or any video tutorials for current affairs and general awareness type of things but it's not like that you are completely devoting five days maybe you know seven days or ten days for this thing only and my personal advice is what for paper one preparation there are many youtube channels right just follow video tutorials of any one good trusted youtuber plus just practice practical questions like di equations reading comprehension this reasoning question practice daily it will increase your speed of attempting those questions with accuracy at the time of exam because speed is very important here 50 questions and 60 minutes you have almost one minute for each question you have so how you are going to attempt the exam that is also very important so that's it for this video maybe next video we will discuss those attempt how to attempt exam those steps so now i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
