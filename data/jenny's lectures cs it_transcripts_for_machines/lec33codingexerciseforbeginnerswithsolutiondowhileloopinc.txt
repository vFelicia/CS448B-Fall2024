so on the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing Loops in C plus plus in the previous video we have discussed dou y u right so now in this video we will discuss some practice problems on do while loop right you will write two programs using do while loop so this would be something like you know coding exercise for you guys so first program is what you have to calculate sum of positive integers right now what kind of output I want see first of all the problem is you have to find out sum of positive integer but you have to understand right what is this problem statement right what kind of output I want according to that after that you have you you know you need to start writing program okay it's not like that just start adding hash into IO stream using YouTube STD and this is no no no logic is very important so for that you have to understand the problem statement first right if you have any question you can ask right so what kind of output I want let me just show you so this type of how I want see it will ask enter a number I am entering one again it will ask enter number suppose 10. next suppose to next suppose 20. next suppose I'm entering a minus 5. so it will print sum as 33 sum of positive numbers only 1 plus 10 plus 2 plus 20 is 33 minus 5 is not in the sum so 33 it should print this type of output I want now pause the video and write down the logic for this thing before seeing the solution so this is the output we want right now how you can write down this thing first of all think the logic see you have to write down this obviously this statement is executing again and again enter a number enter a number so it is asking again and again from the user so you have to put this statement in Loop and we write down this with the help of do while loop so do and this is suppose do y Loop and here we will write some condition this is the general syntax right so here somewhere we have to write down this line like we can write down C out because this would you need to print you need to put this line in a loop because if this line is executing again and again enter a number right and see in what variable I am taking hint number and before this do value outside of this body of the loop I am taking a variable nth number y outside of this Loop y cannot I write here I enter number rather than here because C this it will ask from the user till the number is positive means while the number is positive you are entering a positive number Loop will continue as soon as you enter a negative number Loop will terminate and it will just do some of these positive numbers only not this negative number only sum of positive numbers so you have to put some condition on number if the number is negative stop so in while loop we put condition on number that is why this number we are using this variable outside outside of this Loop body right so you have to declare this outside of this Loop body if you declare here not here then it will give error number greater than equal to 0. while the number is greater than equal to 0 it will repeating the statement will repeat these statements enter a number enter a number enter number as soon as you enter negative number stop so now some of these numbers I hope you know the logic sum so let's declare another variable also sum and initialize it with 0 better because otherwise maybe it will take some garbage value at starting and in garbage value if you add one it will give some garbage value so better to initialize it with zero now where to write down this sum here or here suppose you are writing here sum equal to sum plus number right and after this I am just printing C out what you will print the sum is the sum is and the variable is sum right and return 0 and that's it and here we can return in domain and above the header file and all right now what will happen see okay now we have a number it will take some garbage value Maybe right sum is equal to 0 and we have sum sum is 0 and the number is we don't have any we haven't initialized this number so do c out and try number it will ask a number one so one okay now sum is equal to some plus number so sum becomes 0 plus 1 1 right again now it will check the condition number we have entered is 1 so 1 is greater than equal to 0 yes so again it will enter here so again it will ask enter a number we have entered 10 right this time 10 sum plus number 10 plus 1 is 11 so check at this time number is 10 10 greater than equal to 0 yes condition true again it will enter here again it will ask enter a number we have entered two some plus number means 11 plus 2 is 13 at this point of 5 number is 2 condition true yes again enter here again it will ask enter a number suppose I have entered 20 some plus number means 20 plus this is thirty three at this point of time number is 20 so 20 greater than equal to 0 yes condition true again it will enter focus at this point again it will enter here and it will ask enter a number now I have entered a number minus 5. okay this point of time minus 5. so now this statement this statement would be executed before checking the condition sum is equal to sum plus number so number is this point of prime number is minus five so at this point of time it will become twenty seven right and after that we'll check number is minus 5 minus 5 greater than equal to 0 no condition is not true exit from the loop and it will print sum is 27. so in this logic we have we have done what it will add it will add this negative number also and the sum would be rather than 33 27. but we don't want this we don't want to add this negative number we only want sum of positive numbers only one change you have to do so what you can do before what we want it will ask enter a number and after entering the number just after entering the number it should check the condition right so this line you need to skip as soon as you enter a number minus five it will check the condition condition is not print it will not do sum out of the loop so where you can put this line before asking the number sum is equal to sum Plus number this should be the correct logic here we cannot write down this line right now one more change you need to do now here suppose here we have done so num is equal to nothing sum is equal to 0 right now it will enter sum is equal to some plus number now at this point of time number is any garbage value because you haven't initialized this thing so sum becomes 0 plus various value some garbage value so sum is now some garbage value and when whenever you enter number one so garbage Value Plus One it will give some garbage value unexpected result right so what you can do to rescue from this situation to rescue yourself from the situation we can initialize number with zero at first number is equal to zero number zero sum 0 so at this point of time sum is equal to some plus number sum would be 0 only and then it will ask enter a number and that's this now you will get 33 so this should be the logic right you can rewind this and right in this program right and you will get 33 only so this is how rather than just copying and pasting this correct code you have to try at your own right because maybe sometimes playing would be here and you think that yeah these three lines are here and this is the correct logic because you haven't tried that thing right so try different different Logics right rather than just copying and pasting the correct logic from YouTube or from Google and all right write down your own logic first right so this is the first exercise next exercise is let me just show you what type of output I want so see this is the code that I we have discussed some of positive numbers only right now let me just run this and show you the output see it will ask enter a number one then suppose 10 then 2 then 20 minus 5 any minus number and sum is 33. so this type of output we want right next problem is we want something like you can say simple calculator but what kind of output I want see see at first whenever you will run it should show you the choices one choice one is for addition two for subtraction if you press three then multiplication then four for division and if you press q small q or capital Q then it will quit and then you'll ask enter your choice suppose I am entering 2. so it will print you chose to subtraction right then it will ask enter two numbers separated by a space suppose I am entering 5 and 2. enter it will show subtraction is 3 and then after again it will show you these the menu and it will ask your your choice now if you press suppose 4. it will show you you chose 4 that is division and enter two numbers separated by a space suppose I am entering 4 and three so it will print a division is 1. right and again it will show you the menu now suppose I am entering Cube small keyword Capital view suppose I am entering small q means quit so it will say goodbye that's it so this kind of thing I want and if you enter any other choice rather than one two three four and Q suppose I enter 6 7 8 suppose let's run this again and I'll show you see enter this enter your choice I am entering suppose 7. so it will show you wrong choice try again if I enter suppose h wrong choice try again and it will show you the menu right so this type of output I want so let's pause the video and try this with do while loop within do while you can use maybe your pencils or switch statement it's up to you ok so I hope you have tried this program let's write down this program first thing we want is what within do I Loop see we want that that menu should be repeated again and again right obviously that thing also we will write down that do I Loop in that do I Loop but first time without checking any condition it should show you the menu so in do while loop also dual is also exit control Loop so one time it will run those statements and after that it will check the condition right so what we will do suppose uh in this do y this is some so here in this block we will write down some condition so first thing what we want is that menu should be printed right so it is just for decoration purpose the Slime right like this you want to print like first and first is for as it is you have to write down that thing in C out Edition right and same just copy and paste this line it should ask after that it should ask enter your take a choice variable and obviously condition you will put on what variable on choice because choice is one either one two three four or Q or anything else right so in Choice variable you have to put some conditions so Choice variable what we will do the choice variable should be declared outside of this Loop of the body right so here I am taking int so in not int we are taking care because Q is character so care choice right now okay it will ask this thing now obviously if choice is 1 then it will do addition so now you have to put some condition I am using Harry file statement you can try this with a switch statement also so now we will see if this choice is equal to is equal to 1 because this is character so we put single quote here so now one would be considered as a character not integer if choice is one then one is for addition so now first line what it should print you chose one so in simple C out you can write down see map that output with your program it's not like that just see the output here this kind of thing I want and start writing the program from the beginning only no you can write down from do I loophole so after that you can write down these header files and all right think the logic according to the output map that thing in your program better is this thing right then you know it will be you will be able to enhance your logic building skills so it should print you chose one and addition this line okay after that it should ask right enter two numbers separated by a space so now if you will enter two number then obviously you will need two variables suppose I am taking a and B but this A and B C red line under under this A and B Because identify p and a is undefined we haven't defined these variables A and B so because this A and B we will just use within this Loop of the body better you can declare this a and B here and obviously we want some like here see some A and B now it should do some I am taking a variable sum is equal to a plus B right so the sum is also undefined so you have to declare some initialize some better to initialize it with 0 so that it will not take any garbage value so we need like this a variable to store subtraction also so sub is equal to 0 multiplication is equal to 0 and division equal to zero these four variables also we want now some you have calculated now just print some C out in the output addition is as it is we will write down addition is just the variable and e n d l right so if choice is one these statements would be executed right same thing you have to write on if choice is 2 then 3 then 4 same thing right I'm just copying and pasting this thing now if choice is one addition else if because you have to use LC Federal else if choice is 2 you chose to subtraction then again it will ask enter two numbers several by space a b subtraction a minus B and then it will print else if choices three then multiplication lcf choice is 4 then division okay now one more thing else if choices quit for quit choices Choice equal to equal to small cube or logical or Choice equal to equal to capital Q both mean squid either you press small cure capital Q right then it will print simply goodbye okay other than these if you enter anything else simply don't need to write else if now else otherwise any other choice if you give rather than one two three four and Q it should show you a message what wrong choice try again so else C out wrong choice it is same as we write a default in switch case statement try again right now better to write the ndn here also okay now nothing else we want within this Loop now you have to put the condition in this y right so till you don't press small cure capital Q it should run if you have pressed small q it should quit if you have pressed capital Q then also it should quit right now what should be the choice choice not equal to small q and choice not equal to capital Q choice is not equal to small cure capital Q it should run right if choice is small q or capital Q it should quit so obviously this should be the condition but we cannot put logical over here you can try out this thing if you put logical over here then it will not run according to you know whatever we have expected the output so it should be logical and right simply return 0. right and let's save this and I hope now you would have to write down a program let's run this C the menu is here enter your choice one you chose One Edition I'm entering two number two and three addition is five again it will show you the menu I am entering three we chose three multiplication right enter two numbers separated by space four six multiplication and multiplication is twenty four again again suppose I am entering Choice seven wrong choice try again okay I am entering e wrong choice try again I am entering small queue goodbye and exit if you enter Capital code so then also goodbye in it that's it so this was the program I hope you got how to write down this program right so if let's just write down here logical over and try this out you try this out what output we are getting because see you have to put here logical and if you put here logical or in that case what will happen see suppose I am entering choice is a mentoring Choice Q small q right so okay after checking all the effects this fence is true this because choice is small q right so this is true so it will be true so it will uh what print goodbye and then it will check the condition choice not equal to small q but we have entered small q this condition is what false right because we have entered small q and the condition is choice not equal to q but this is Q so this is false okay fine but in logical or we have to check that second condition also choice not equal to capital Q this condition is true the choice is small and we are checking for capital Q so this condition is true so false and true in logical or it will give true so if the condition is true again it will repeat it is not going to end right that is why we put here logical and you can try this out right so I hope you got these two programs how to use do while loop while writing programs and all and the next video we'll see range based for Loops now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
