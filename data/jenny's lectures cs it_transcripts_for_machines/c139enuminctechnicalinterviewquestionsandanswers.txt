so in the previous video we have discussed about enum data type what is inaudible some properties or phenom data types some important points with the help of example right in this video we'll see some questions interview questions that has been asked in technical round on enumbria type right and if you are aware about the properties of enum data type that we have discussed in previous video then

out now let's see those two questions that we are going to discuss those two interview questions on enum let me just write down though those questions first so these are two questions first we'll discuss this question see outside this main we have defined a data type with the help of this enum enum xenum right and the list of constant in this is what c cpp and java that's it now in main function i'm declaring a variable where of this data type and i'm just printing size of where right now what output you will get here what output you will get here first of all thing and now remember the property see whenever you declare a variable of this enum then at one time it can take only one value from out from these values out of these values only one value at a time at a time only one value right and by default this would be considered as 0 1 2 by the compiler as in teasers zero one two right and the size of integer is on sixty four bit bit machine i am running this right so the size of it is four bytes so that is why size of where would be four bytes here maybe in options mcqs you will get like four bytes or one is like 12 bytes or some error these kind of things you will get right so the answer would be four bytes only it will take at one time only one value and the value is these are related with constant like zero one two ah sorry integers so integer is taking four byte in sixty four bit machine so it will give four bytes now if i modify this with this thing enum one more enum y enum and here i'm writing c cpp java and xenum right and in main i am i'm doing what why enum wire and size of where so what output you will get in this case see one property i have told you that in the same scope same values of these these same values are not allowed see cpp java these are same so it is not allowed it will give error but see here i'm using in enum i'm using another in enum this is another em i using this is allowed this will not give error but yeah these values are duplicate because in the same scope we are using two enum and these constant are same so it will give error right right yeah enum with an enum is allowed but these duplicates are not allowed right i hope you got this now you can try out this thing another thing is what you can remove just to this and just write down x enum here that's it and then what output you will get this is assignment for you you have to tell me in comment box run this program and tell me what you will get here size of where next is all this thing see here i am using typedef enum within the cinema the values are male and female only two values and gender name of this is gender i mean main function gender where i am declaring a variable of the senum type and i am assigning the value female and i am printing this where so now what output you will get male is zero by default female is one so here you will get one but you have to tell me you are supposed to run this program and you have to tell me the these answers are correct or not maybe i am wrong right so run these programs tell me you are getting you know error or you are getting same output or not maybe in this you will get error like here i am using only gender i am not using enum here but here i am using enum and i have told you in the previous video also when you are declaring a variable you are supposed to use enum then the name but in here i am using only i'm not using enum i'm using only gender so maybe you think it will give error just run it and if it is don't giving any error you are getting one then why you are getting correct output why it is not giving error why the answer of this question you are supposed to write down in common books right why if you don't know then you can ask me in comment box i'll tell you in a another video whenever we'll make another video then i'll tell you the answer of these questions right i hope not these see these questions i guess very simple if you know the properties of enum right then these questions are very simple for you guys so that's it for this video now and i'll see the next video till then bye bye take care
