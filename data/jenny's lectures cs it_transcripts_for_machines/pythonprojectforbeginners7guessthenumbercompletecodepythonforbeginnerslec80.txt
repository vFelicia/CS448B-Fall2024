hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of Learning Partner programming language in this video we'll be discussing one more project till now about this series we have discussed six projects so this is our seventh project and these projects are of you know not of that high level these are for beginners right so the project is you have to guess the correct number okay okay first of all let me just show you the output whenever after you know completing the project whenever you will run that project then what it should give you like what kind of output you will get see so it will show whenever you will run it will show something like this like the name of the project guess the number how to uh you know print this skyr that also will tell you now it will show like let me think of a number between one two fifty you can take here one to five hundred any range you can take maybe 5200 or anything right I'm taking just an example of 1 to 50. now choose level of difficulty is your heart I am choosing easy now it will show for easy level you have 10 attempts for hard level you are having five attempts so it will show you have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number now you have to make a guess suppose 30. now it will show your guess is too low guess again now you have only nine attempts right guess is too low means the number is above 30 so I'm guessing it's 40. but your guess is the same too high yes again and then it will show you have eight attempts now so let's 45 your guess is too high again then it's 42 it's again too high suppose 41 it's 2i 40. again too high 35 too high 33 again it's too high and I have only two remaining attempt like 32 C your guess is right and the answer was 32. that will stop right okay let's run this again if I am choosing hard level now you are having only five attempts remaining to guess the number guess 40. it's too high 30. again 2i 20. then 2 higher than 10 it's again too high and now I'm only having one attempt so let's say 5. your guess is too low you are out of gases you lose this time because you are out of attempt now only five attempt in only five attempts you have to place the right number in hard level right so I hope now you have idea what you need to do so you can just make a flowchart first divide or divide this thing in modules right first thing it will ask it will show this thing then it will ask for difficulty level according to difficulty level it will show how many attempts you are having right then make a guess then it will compare the number which this computer has thought and your guess so it will compare those two numbers and according whatever the result of that comparison it's too high or too low it will show you the result and then yes again this message would be again printed yes again and now this message again would be printed but with one less number of attempt right like this so this this thing is in repetition like make a guess according to it will show the result if it is not correct then yes again and then it will show the number of attempts right so now according to this you can just divide this into number of modules and then work on different different like small small modules divide this problem into small part so try to first of all create a flowchart I hope you can create that flowchart right pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have done this now let's create a new file and name it guess the number.py right first what it will show the sky art later we will add on right that is for decoration okay first it will show you what let me think of a number this kind of thing see see let me think of a number between 1 to 50 right now how you can generate a random number from 1 to 50 in a Range if you are aware about that module random module that we have discussed in previous videos you know what is the function that is from this module random dot we have a function Rand int and you can just give the range 1 to 50. it will generate a number between 1 to 50 both 1 and 50 are inclusive right and whatever number you it will generate we can just store that thing in a variable answer or any other variable right but don't show this to the user whenever you run this okay but for this for trial purpose now let's just show the answer to user now it will ask what choose level of difficulty is your hard so let's just input that thing also using input function take input whatever you will input that let's take a variable level in that we are going to store okay so easy and hard that is the string so no need to convert this into int now if easy or hard according to that the number of attempts for easy it should be 10 for R it should be 5 okay now suppose we are having a function see you can do it without using a function that is your way there are multiple ways to do this project right but we have discussed functions recently so that is why I am using functions in this case right so let's just have a function set difficulty and there just pass one argument level we are calling this function so before calling obviously we have to Define this so let us Define this function set difficulty and level chosen the variable I'm taking level chosen or simply same variable level level you can take same name it's up to you no problem now check if this level chosen is equal to is equal to easy in that case number of attempts are 10. so maybe you can say something like this number of or simply attempts equal to 10 you can set this right ah Pi something like this so these are we can say these are local variables attempts attempts within this function right so it's better to create like we can say we have constants also like Pi is a constant so let's create we create up that variable Pi globally that is a constant and anywhere in your program we can use that so better to create these variables global right and globally but it should be a constant means no one can change means we should not change these variable right so simple if you take any variable we take this type of name so to differentiate that this should be a constant and we should not change this value during this code we can take something like this like e we can take the variable name in capital letter right so easy level attempts equal to 10. set this and hard level attempts and hard level attempts is equal to 5. right so it would be clear like if these are in capital letter it means I want this should be a constant this is a constant and I don't want to change this during this score I don't want that anyone should change this these two variables right now or you can choose this method also attempt and attempt five rather than creating constant okay I'm just giving you one way of solving this question if you got this thing then there are multiple ways and you can try out different different uh different different ways and you can play the with this code right so rather than this what I do you also have okay done this thing like return now if level is easy then return this one easy level attempts l return hard level items means return 10 or return 5. okay so it is returning that is why we have to store that thing in a variably so we can store this in attempts a variable name attempt simply attempts okay now that is fine now it will ask now next thing is it will show you have five attempts remaining to guess the number but this line is this C repeating you have four attempts you have three attempts you have two attempts only the change is this value so this line should be in a loop right and then make a guess this also is in a loop then your guess is too high like obviously this this thing you will see later right now now first it should print number of attempts remaining so use F string and you have how many attempts left that is in this you can say this variable attempts you have this many attempts remaining to guess the number right although this is in Loop but that also will see now let's ask from the user or like yes a number and whatever it will guess that I'll store in this variable guest number right okay now we have to check the this number and our guess number is same or not so let's suppose we have a function check answer and there obviously we are going to pass your guest number and the answer and then we will compare right so let's define that also let's define that function so it will accept to argument guest number and answer same name I am taking you can take different name modes so that is also fine now compare if this guest number is less than or answer means it will print first what what message your guess is too low and second thing what it will do it will reduce the number of attempts by one okay and it will again Ask it will print that message also yes again your guess is like maybe 2 low or two I and then it will print a message guess again and then it will reduce the number of attempts and this line would be again printed right so reduce the number of attempts by one but how you can reduce that thing so one way we can do is in this parameter again pass the attempts one more uh sorry again not again one more argument that is number of attempts whatever number of attempts at first you have like 10 so that would be also passed as an argument so here same name I'm taking attempts so it will do attempts sorry attempt minus one okay so suppose it is returning these attempts minus 1. okay till now it's fine but else if L if your guess number is greater than answer in that case what should be printed your guess is too high and okay same thing this time also this will do return attempt minus 1. okay else it will print your guess is right and the answer was in which variable we are having the answer in answer variable so using X string we can print that thing right your guess is right and the answer was this now back to okay where it will return to this check answer so we are see it is returning simple the returning attempts minus 1 means a number variable attempts okay see you know this line this line these are in should be a loop right so after setting this difficulty level this should be in Loop so Y and what is the condition to break this Loop if the answer is equal to the guest number then simply break the loop loop you no need to guess again okay so while your guest number not equal to so why your guest number not equal to your answer till then these lines should be repeated but see it will give any advice so because guess number is a variable we are using before we are defining this variable because here we are taking guest number is equal to this and before this only we are using this so because see before we are not having any variable guest number so it will give an error so better to do one thing to run this program successfully just set the guest number first zero at first right now it's fine obviously 0 not equal to the answer and 0 is not within the range of 1 to 50. so definitely at first time this condition would be definitely false so we are going to enter here for sure right okay now okay so in this end we have sorry we are having an error before this we should write down like hint now it's fine now let's run this and see let me think of think of number between 1 to 50 and 15. we know the answer it's just a trial version let's choose the level hard now you have five attempts remaining to guess the number let's guess number 30 your guess is too low you have only four attempts remaining to guess the number guess the number suppose I'm guessing 45. again two low three attempts 12. two low two attempts 23. you have only one attempts okay 45 see now see your guess is too low you have zero attempts but still it is asking yes a number yes a number suppose six you have minus one attempts remaining to guess a number means we should stop the loop if number of attempts are zero right if number of attempts are zero then also Stop the Loop and if you have guessed the right number then also Stop the Loop two condition to stop the loop right you got this thing I hope okay now check if these attempts equal to equal to zero right you are out of gases and you lose and here obviously you have to be out of this while loop right but the condition to exit from this while loop is only when the guess number is equal to the answer then only we can exit okay okay let's let it be like this only else if I write like else okay now else it should print yes again it is still having some bugs but let me just run this what it will show you let's choose hard level now you have five attempts guess a number 34 your guess is 2i Yes again this message this time has been printed yes again because we have printed this message now four attempts 34 23 12 only one attempt 45 still guess a number you are having minus one attempt like this so you have to stop this thing if number of attempts are zero then then you have to stop this while loop right now how you can stop see we have one method like from a function we can return we know if you want to exert from that function we can simply write down a statement simple return that's it right so if this thing is in a function then simply what we can do we can simply write here return and it will be exit from this while loop as well as from the function right but if this is not in a function that is why it is showing an error because return we can return statement can be used only within a function right so let's put this thing into a function name suppose gay and we are not passing any argument everything from the first line right so everything should be indented right and at last definitely obviously to play this game you have to call that function to execute this functionality so we are calling this game now simply we can do return now it's fine if you are out of gases then definitely it will be you would be out of that Loop so again our guesser number see now you're out of guesses and you lose but what if you are not out of gases and you have just guessed the right number then also you have to be out from that Loop let's run this again let's see a bug here let's choose a level easy level you have 10 attempts 10. your guess is too lows okay 40 try to guess the right number 40 is too high okay 35 is too low yes again and your RAM is seven atom too low means you let's guess 37. it's again too low so 38. again to root 39. see your guess is right the answer is was 39 but guess again it is printing this statement yes again but this should not be a case it should not be printed this line your guess is right the answer is 39 and that's it right so this is the bug here yes again it should not be printed so in this else part you have to put something else okay one condition L if c not directly else guess again only if else if you are out of the cases you lose but else if still your guest number not equal to answer then only print guess again if the guess number is equal to answer then no need to print case again right I hope you got this condition why I am putting this condition okay let me just show you let's run this and same I'm taking easy level I'm trying to guess right see guess number nine and your guess is right the answer is nine but still I'm having one attempt left and it is not printing yes again right so because of this condition right now the ski art if you want to decorate your project so in Google you can search simply like text to a sky art generator right and on any link you can click and then see it will ask for enter your text so I am guessing I am entering the name of our project guess the number and then see this is a riskayat or you can change this also so you can change the font from here and what so from here you can copy this and then just create a new file and I'll just create your logo underscore r dot py and there take a variable name any variable name you can take logo and you can just paste this guess the number but before that this is a string here so you have to put this thing into these three quotation mark right now that's fine now in your project while starting your game you can just import you can just print what you first of all but you have to import that module because you are you are you have that sky in another module so import what is the name of that module logo underscore add so here you can simply print logo underscore art Dot logo there we have a name Logo right now let's run this see it will show the logo first guess the number right and now you can just okay one more thing you don't need to show this thing so that was just a trial version so better to delete this line because the answer should not be shown to the user now see let me think of a number between 1 to 15 now it's not shown let me just try out one more time hard you have only five attempts 40 yes is too high 30 your guess is right the answer was 30 in only one attempt I have got the answer right so this was our project I guess that is not so much tough and one more thing if you don't enter the level easy or hard if anything else you will enter Then what will happen so that also you can modify here suppose here only see set difficulty level here if I choose L if this level chosen equal to equal to hard then only return this thing else if something else you choose then it should print like maybe you have chosen a wrong level and play again now what we can do else simply we can return that set return means exit else return from set difficulty and here after this you need to check if these attempts whatever returned from there if the attempts not equal to easy level attempts and attempts not equal to hard level attempts means neither of this condition or this condition is true means sorry neither this condition nor this condition is true means something else you have entered so in that case what should be printed print like it should print a message you have entered wrong difficulty level play again and it should exit so simply you can write down here return let's send this and if I print here something else so you have entered wrong difficulty level play again so you have to start this so again right so like this you can play with this code if you think if you want to modify like you have entered this wrong difficulty level then it should ask again like choose again the level of difficulty type is your heart that also you can do but that is for your assignment okay now you can modify this thing whatever according to your you know creative thinking and what you want to do with this project if you want to modify if you want to upgrade this project then you can do that right I hope you got this the basic one and there are multiple ways to solve this problem to create this project it is not the one it is not the only one right so you can just write down this on a piece of paper you can manually run this manually right on this and definitely you will get it it's not that much done right now that's for this video now I'll see in the next video bye take care
