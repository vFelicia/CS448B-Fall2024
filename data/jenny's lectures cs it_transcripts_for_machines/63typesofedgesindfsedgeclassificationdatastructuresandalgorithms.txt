hi guys welcome back today's topic is types of edges after DFS traversal or depends a classification of edges of a graph after the DFS traversal of that graph DFS means depth first search traversal of that graph okay so first of all I will tell you how many types of edges would be there four types of edges would be there first one is tray edge second is forward edge third one is back edge and fourth one is cross edge okay now these are four types of edges three edges what when you traverse that graph or you can say when you are applying that DFS traversal depthfirst search traversal okay then the edges which are member of the DFS traversal those edges would be bring edges okay next is forward edge we will discuss all the edges with the help of this example okay forward is would be what suppose we have an edge E or E or Phi X Y X Y X from X to Y okay then that edge would be called as forward edge in which Y appears after X means X Pelley inochi uske baad y a guy in the graph okay or appears means what you can say we are considerable consider a you know a very variable that is time variable okay and when you traverse this graph then when you discover any node then we would you know that node notice the time period time of that node starting time of that node end you can say finishing time of that node I'll discuss with this example so any edge would be any edge XY would be forward edge in which Y appears after X and there is a path from X to Y okay what is back edge as the name suggests backward edge any edge XY edge would be from X to Y X to Y this one is I'm talking about directed graph okay X Y where Y appears before X see is make about that why appears after X or beccaj macaca why appears before X and there is a path from Y to X and what is the cross edge any edge from X to Y would be a cross edge where there is no path from Y to X you cannot come from Y to X ok so let us discuss these type of edges with the help of this example then it will be laid it out see suppose this one is our example and we are applying DFS traversal on this graph first of all ok we will consider one variable that is time variable okay you will start you can start the DFS traversal from any node fine we are taking this node a as a starting node we are starting our DFS traversal from this node okay now first of all go to this node a and not the time time starting make a hugga one you can say the starting time of this node or you can say the appearing time of this node or you can say the discovering time of this node right now we are at this node at time stamp at time 1 okay just say just say I'm ugly budding a time will increase by 1 okay now we're starting time of this node is what 1 ok now in DFS traversal you can go either this side or on this side say there could be many DFS traversal of this graph I have already discussed the the DFS traversal method in the previous video I will provide you the link in the description box also you can check out that thing so there could be many DFS traversal of this graph I am NOT saying that there would be a unique DFS traversal but we are taking 1 DFS traversal ok ok I am going to this side you can see you can traverse this one from this side either to f4 either to the side you can go to B also I am going to be we are going to be so will mark this edge fine now we have reached to be means you have discovered this be then time of order you can say the starting time of this nodebased what will increase the time by one that is okay next starting time of is what sorry B is what now from B where you can go in DFS traversal we can go to see only fine now we will move to C and this will mark this edge alright we have reached to see now so the starting time over you can see the peering time of C becomes 3 now time will increase by 1 now from see where you can go you can go either to be or to e find your two choices let us suppose we are going to we are traversing this e through this edge now we have reached to this you know what is the appearing time also the discovering time of this is what or you can say the starting time of e fine three top not starting time would be now four okay now from II can you go anywhere is there any outgoing edge no there is no outgoing is we cannot go anywhere we cannot traverse the graph now now you have to do what backpack fine now in backtracking where you will go will go to this C and before backtracking will increase the time okay now starting time of this is what for now we can not go anywhere from this e so you can say this has been finished so you can say the finishing time of this e is what fine angle increase by one finishing time a public okay when you are not able to move forward from that node and you have to backtrack from that node fine okay the finishing time of this is what five now we have to backtrack we have reached back to say now can you war anywhere from sea yes we can go to this way right we can mark this engine we have reached to D now what is the discovering or the starting time but you can say the appearing time of B is what five then next is what six okay six is the appearing time of this T okay now from B where you can go there is only one outgoing is and that is going to be can we go from D to B no we cannot go because B is already traversed so we are not we cannot go to be okay now from B we cannot go anywhere so this is now you can say that D has been finished or the finishing time of this B would be seven now you would backtrack and now we have reached to back to C okay now check out is there any remaining node you can traverse from C no thus node is already traverse this node is all new traversed we cannot go anywhere you have to backtrack so this is also finished the traversing or you can say the exploring of this node is also finished that is why we right now the finishing time of the C and this would be eight seven to eight now from see your backtrack we have reached to this B can we go anywhere from this be no we cannot go because C has been already traversed we have to backtrack before backtracking build you know this has been finished then we will write down the finishing time of this B would be nine okay now from B can you go anywhere else no backtrack backtrack to a now from a can you go anywhere else can you traverse any other node yes we still have one node that is F so we will not pride the finishing time of a because a has not been finished still we have some node that are yet to be traversed okay now we will go to this side B will mark this edge right now we have reached 2f what is the starting time of this F now 9 to 10 it has it is now 10 starting time of it now next where we can go to we can go to G and we'll mark this edge we have reached to this G starting time of G would be now 11 now from G where you can go you can go either to L 2 H or to M you have three options you can go to any node suppose we are traversing this node L we are going to L now what is the starting time of L we have marked the said starting time of L would be 2 L now because is Kyle eventhough now one increase over that would be too well now now from L where you can go we cannot go anywhere because there is no outgoing edge so this has been finished reversing or for exploring of this node has been finished because we cannot go anywhere forward so we have to backtrack and before backtracking will write down the finishing time of the cell finishing time will be what 13 now backtrack to G from G is there any node where you can go yes we can go to H or you can go to and we have still two choices now suppose we are going to this H and will mark this edge now we are going to this H what is the starting time of H that would be 14 because third time of Nakata pot you go to 13 now next is 40 now from H where you can go you can go either to K or either to I you have two choices suppose we are taking this route we are traversing this I what is the starting time of I now that would be 15 from I where you can go you can go to jail only or you can say you can traverse this J only so mark this edge and we are going to take what is the starting time of this J now that would be 16 okay now from Jay we are at this node now Jay you can go anywhere can you go anywhere no we don't have any other choice you how to back path so you can say this node has been finished so the finishing time of Jay would be 17 and now we have to backtrack okay backtrack I okay now from I can you go anywhere else oh yes we can go to this ones we have one outgoing edge but will you go to this node no because this node has already been visited we this has starting timers and in time this node has already been visited so we will not go to this node is there an end this has been finished so the finishing time of this I would be 18 now we have to backtrack to this H okay from H can you go anywhere else is there any node still remaining left yes we can traverse this node we can go to K will mark this edge and we'll go to K now now what is the starting time of K that would be 19 because we have time has been raised to 18 now that would be 19 okay now from K can you go anywhere else yes we have two outgoing edges to M into L but we cannot go to L because this node has already been traversed we will go to this M and mark this edge now what is the appearing time or you can say starting time of M would be 20 fine now check out can you go anywhere else from this M yes we have two edges two outgoing edges to I into H but we cannot reverse this I because this has already been visited we cannot go to H because so this has already been visited traversed so we cannot go anywhere else from M this has been finished so the finishing time of the same would be 21 and we have to backtrack now there we will backtrack okay fine now from K can you go anywhere else no we cannot go to L this has visited so the finishing time of K would be 22 and we have to backtrack now from edge can you go anywhere else no we cannot go anywhere else so the finishing time of H would be 23 we have to backtrack we'll go to G after backtracking now explore this G also can you go anywhere else yes one outgoing edge is still remaining G mm but we cannot reverse this M because this M has already been traversed or visited okay so we cannot go from G to M that is why G has a is also finished so finishing time of this G would be 24 we have to backtrack we are now at this place at F is there any node left which you can traverse no there is no node left from if you can go so the finishing time of F would be 25 and we would backtrack to a and the finally a is also finished and the finishing time of a would be 26 so this is the DFS traversal of this graph now you have to find out the different type of edges see first of all what is pre edge jitney B edges up knee marquee and the edges which are a member of DFS traversal during the DFS traversal jitney B edges up knee visit curry him take a yeah p.m. neon go mark earlier those edges would be reiatives okay and out of remaining edges you have to find out which one is forward edge which one is back edge and which one is cross edge okay so I'm just writing the tree edges pre edges con con seen happen upon how the tree edges would be see this edges common mark and the edges which are member of DFS traversal how many edges are there this one aibee aibee BC BC c e c d e f FG g l GH h i i J H K and K M these are 23 edges now what are remaining edges and the edges which are you know in this read reading those are not under the tree edges those are still left and out of these edges you have to find out which one is forward which one is back as in which one is cross edge let us take example let us take we are just taking this edge D to be now this one is backward edge or forward edge or crosses you how you have to find it out d e C directed edge here to arrow is from D to e now here how will find out edge of nikki ahead d be this one d be so here X is what B and Y is y is what be fine I put the answer take nap case I find out kuruvi X is this one and Y is this one X Y take a now find out X appears first before Y or Y appears before X you guess I find out who you have knew how to check the starting time by checking the starting time X up ahead dy o Kekaha be starting time of B is what and starting time of this D is what six starting time of B is less okay starting time either become high it means what B appears before D fine it means Y appears before X or Y a case may have car y appears before X fine and the second condition involved there is a path from Y to X now here y is what B is there any path from this B to D yes you can go from B to C then C to d there is a path from here to here from Y to X so this edge is what back H fine this would be what back edge this DB let us take one more edge let us take this one be e de as is from D to e here X is what B and Y is what e find out which one appears first starting time of e is for starting time of days six fine starting time of E is less than starting time of day it means e appears before be right means y Y appears before X Y appears before X okay but you have to check the second condition also there is a path from Y to X here Y is what e is there any path from e to be sorry E D no we cannot go from E to D there is no path so you cannot say this one is back edge this one is what cross edge C cross edge edge would be X to Y where there is no path from Y to X you cannot move from Y to X so this edges what cross edge okay now let us take this one H f H f here X is what H and Y is what F find out which appears first H f starting time of F is less than starting time of H it means f appears before H it means Y appears before X Y appears before X this is what it should be back edge but you have to sec check the second conditional so there is a path from Y to X now here Y is what F is there any part from F to H yes you can go F to G then G to H both condition has been satisfied so this one is what package this one is also back edge okay let us take this one g2m okay g2m edges from g2m direct edge here 2x would be what g + y would be here m find out which appears first starting time of g is 11 starting time of AF is sorry ms20 so g appears before M or G has been discovered before to be starting times Youkilis A to G paheli I have Skiba a Maya it means Yahweh gkx X appears before y SI y appears after x or the second is what X appears before why here why appears after X fine and there is a path from X to Y obviously there is a path direct path he hates me take our Y a path vo Sofia this is from X to Y and this is also not a part of three edge is my second up third condition kyoki that edge should not be the part of tree edge G to M yep car tree edge mean he has so this would be what a key a consuming forward edge GM Valley que Haga apply forward edge let us take this one this case M to I edges what M I X is what M and y is what I M to I which appears first starting time of is 15 starting time of this one is 20 means I appears before M it means y uki apna caja why why appears before x y appears before x take the second condition there is a path from Y to X here Y is what I why is there any path from I to M check out I you can go to jail but Jessica University from I you can go to D from D you can go to either E but I get couch neither asset F from D you can go to BBC up see just at the or D and E no you cannot go from I to M so there is no path from Y to X so this cannot be back edge say one condition is true that is why appears before X but second condition is not true there is no path from Y to X so we cannot say say this one is back is this one is what cross hinge okay check out this one I to D X is what I this one is y so here also Y appears by appears after Y appears before X because beaker starting time is 6 I guess starting time is 15 so I to D X 2y y appears before this X Y appears before X is there any path from b2i can we go check out they say I'm a just something but I am kinda just after D say we can go to BBC MCC say yoga sucked a bit we cannot go from D to I there is no path from Y to X so this is also what cross hence this I to D this is also what cross H so like this you can find out so we have one remaining lip that is M to H X to Y here also this y this is y now the Y car starting time is 14x car starting time is 420 y appears before x y appears before x check out is there any path from Y to X can you go from H to M yes there is a path you can go to this K then to M so this this s would be what back edge ok now this is the list of edges 3 edges forward edges only one g2m back edges will be DB hf n MH & Crofts edge would be be kay lmin Heidi see this is also remaining k2l this one is also remaining this is not under the free edge from k2l xsk this one is why and here what is apparent time of X is 19 appearing time of y is what well it means Y appears before X Y appears before X you have to check second condition is there any path from Y to X means L 2 K can you go from L to K no we cannot go from L to K that is why it is known as what cross edge fine so this is the this is the list of edges and the one more condition is what union of all the four type of edges would be what all the edges in the graph if you do the union of three edges forward edge back edge and cross edge in sub kharap Union Carraway then you will get the total number of edges which are there in this graph fine you can check out this okay so I'll say in the next video till then bye bye take care
