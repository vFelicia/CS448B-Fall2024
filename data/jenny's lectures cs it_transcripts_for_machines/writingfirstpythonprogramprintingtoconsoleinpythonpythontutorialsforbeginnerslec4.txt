so in the series of learning python programming language in the previous video we have discussed like how to download and install ide for python pycharm we have installed and python interpreter you can see python 3.10.6 we have installed right so now i guess you're all set with your laptop you have python you have an id to write your programs right you have that interpreter also okay because python is an interpreted language so we have already now downloaded and installed a base interpreter for our python language i hope you have done this thing now in this video we'll see how to print something on console or you can say we will write our first program in python and what usually we do whenever you learn a new programming language the first program you write is you print that classical hello world on output screen on the console the same thing we will do we'll print hello world on the screen on the console right in python so to print like in c we use which function print a function in c plus plus we use c out to print something on the screen in python what do we use in python 3.10 through point x version python 1.x python 2.x python 3.x but python 2.x version they have ended the support for python two point x uh version right two point one two point two like this now three point x we are working on three point ten basically the recent is three point ten point six so in this we have a function named print this is the function print so this we use to print something on the console okay now don't need to read and don't need to write any header file or anything or main function or anything simply you need to write what print whatever you want to print the string or you can say the string or whatever message you want to print that we will put here within these parentheses okay so i want to print hello world so simply in double quotes i'll write hello world that's it no semicolon nothing else if you will run this on your output screen you will get this program this output hello world if you don't print anything if simply you write print and you click on run on that file suppose i have a file the extension of python file is dot py right so we are simply running this thing empty parenthesis it's okay it will run what it will print just a blank line okay nothing would be shown just a blank line cursor would be here nothing would be shown if i want if you execute two print function then one and two two blank line would be shown something like this right so you can say it will the sprint function will produce an invisible new line character new line means add a new line so it will produce an invisible new line character because of that new line character we see you know a new blank line on your screen right i'll show you practically also now whatever you want to print you just write within these codes we let hello world simply write hello world so now let me do some experiment with this uh what you have to write down this how you can write down this thing if you don't put this closing codes what type of error you will get and these things let's just do practical on this uh print function and see before going to practical let me just this this is what in python the syntax is python in python 3 3.x in python two point x the previous uh versions print was just a statement it was not a function so what we used to write in that case print and hello world whatever you need to print you can just write down in these quotes so print hello world that's it no parenthesis so it was considered it was as a statement in python 2.x but here in python 3 it is a function so if you are using python 3 point x version right then if you write something like this if you don't put these parentheses you will get error message syntax error message right if you are using python 2.x version you can write down print something like this so let's just do practical of this thing so we have opened our pycharm ide and let me just first change the color so you can go to file if you want to change if you are comfortable with this color you can go for this but i am not comfortable so go to setting and appearance in appearance just theme and i want either this this light or window 10 lite this one so you can go for any one from here you can set these themes okay so now let's change this color and just click ok now i guess you can see it clearly the code fine now we have created our first project in the previous video and first file first dot py okay if you want to create another file what you have to do in the first project on first project just click right click new and file and just name your file okay so i'm not going to create in the first dot py only extension is dot py we are printing so okay how to print just use the sprint function print fine let me just write down again p r i n t print and see it is showing you this is the you know beauty of this ide auto completion and see the print syntax it is showing here you can write down this values sap and file flash whatever these things that also one by one will be discussing but right now just if i just click enter it will give me like these parentheses automatically so now within these parentheses i'm adding hello world okay now let me just run this for you first see from here i have to select here main file is selected so i am going to select current file so current file is first dot py current file means i am working in this file and let's just or you can click in this this is the run button or you can just right click and this run first click on this okay now here it is going to run now and now it will print on your screen hello world first time you know it is taking some time because of the indexing and all so see you can see here hello world fine if i miss this semicolon this sorry this um double quote closing double quote as you can see a red red underline means there is something wrong there is an error okay so this is what you can say uh this id will give you these kind of things if you use id this is you can see some features or some advantages of using id c missing closing codes so from here only you will come to know yeah you have missed quotes or if you run this here also you will get c now type of error c syntax error syntax error it is a syntax error so types of errors there are many types of error okay that also ah with these parallely with the code we will be seeing this is what syntax error syntax means what there are some rules to write programs in any you know programming language and those rules are known as syntax if you don't follow the syntax then it will give syntax error so now syntax or you can say like we have grammar rules okay same in programming language also we have some rules to write down these programs so these are syntax known as syntax if now it is syntax error because syntax is what in print whatever string the message which is not a code actually see print is a code it will do something it will tell the interpreter to do something but this hello world is rather than hello world i can write jenny's lectures i can write anything else like you are the best so this is just a message it's not a code so other than the code whatever you write the message or the string that we will put in quotes okay single quotes as well as double quotes that also will discuss when to put single code when to put double quote okay now right now i'm putting double quote because actually i am from c and c plus background so to write down string i used to put the string the sequence of character as a string in double quotes okay so now see syntax error it will give syntax error unterminated string literal hello world this is a string literal it is unterminated you haven't terminated this thing detected at line number one line number one this is also a skill to identify what is the error type of error in which line at all okay so you have to you know learn this thing also parallel okay now see you can see one arrow here you have started this string literal but you haven't terminated here in line number one or if you are not getting what is the error just simply the error then text error this thing copy this thing open your google paste that and just click enter okay or more specifically you can write this error in python in whatever programming language you are you know practicing you're learning so generally first you know that link would be from stack overflow so there someone has already asked this type of questions and you will get many answers simple okay so now let's just first what you have to do close this now see after closing this is what syntax highlighting also you need to know the sprint is what in black the string is what in green this hello world plus these codes in green color okay and if you miss this and these ah what you can say so the sprint is what in not in black it's in blue and these parentheses are in black so if you remove this double quote from here this parenthesis and the ending of the parentheses parenthesis this is also in green color so there is something wrong you can identify okay okay now put this one and just run this again so it will print now hello world whatever you want to print you can print now if you don't put this parenthesis will give an error see you can see the red underline here again okay let me just run this and it will give again some error see it is giving syntax error missing parenthesis in call to print did you mean this print you are calling print calling means print is a function so we are calling print but missing parenthesis missing parenthesis because we are using three point exposures and so here you have to put these parentheses okay now okay what you need to do blank print you can call see blank print also you can call it will not print nothing but a blank line it will call an individual new line character so again if i write print and call you will see two blank new line same three four five print plan you will call these blank line would be increased like this i hope now print is clear to you now in next video i'll discuss a coding exercise with you guys okay so i hope every point about print function is clear to you guys how to write down your first program how to print something on console in python now in the next video we will see a coding exercise related to this print function right so i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
