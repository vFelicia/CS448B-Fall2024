hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen what is event listening and how to implement this thing right in Python using Turtle Graphics right so now based on that we'll be seeing one coding exercise in this video right let me show you I want to draw something this kind of thing like a sketch kind of thing so uh so whenever you run that you'll get a turtle and uh you can move like while pressing any key suppose I'm pressing F key to move forward like B to move backward and L to tilt and move something like this and R to move something like this then L then maybe like R and you you're going to you know draw any sketch then again forward then maybe backward then left then maybe right something like this any sketch right and after that it should like clear the screen as well like I want to clear the screen after the drawing of this Turtle I want to clear that drawing right so that thing also so any sketch like you can draw using that right so let's clear the screen using C and at last Turtle would be should be at the home position at 0 0 coordinate right so how we are going to draw this thing because in the previous video we have seen only we can we are going to tilt the turtle to 90° angle 270 180 something like this but here the angle we don't know at particular which particular angle right so for that the hint is you can use those heading and set heading kind of thing how to do how to use how to set the heading that you need to take care right so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this let's create a new file and same what we need to do first the basic thing from Turtle just import the turtle class and Screen class right and let's create a turttle Tom do to is equal to turtle and also create a screen screen is equal to the class name is screen with capital S so object name you can take like S1 s or AB BCD or anything right and at last first let's do exit on this thing right okay now we you have to bind the thing F key to move forward b key to move backward then L to turn left R press R to turn right something like this and C for clearing the screen clearing the drawing of that particular to right okay so let's Define function we have like one function is move forward so this here tural is going to move in forward Direction by maybe 20 pixel or 10 pixel suppose 10 right and we have one is same like move move backward and we have for that also either you can use back or backward these two functions Tom do backward we haven't used backward till now we were using only forward so let's use now this function also backward by 10 okay now when we have function like turn left okay now here there's no particular angle so wherever the turtle is from that just turn left left and just it's not like turn left to a particular angle right so what we'll do we will find out the heading first the current heading and then we will add something to that angle some angle like 5 or 10° okay so the current is how to find out current heading we have a function heading so this will give you the current heading of that total you will add plus like 20 or Plus 10 or 15 if you add plus 20 so and it would be suppose new heading new heading is equal to current heading + 10 and after that just set that to heading set heading to whatever the new heading something like this and then forward 10 pixel right same put on right okay okay not same there is a little bit difference you can pause the video and try this out how to do this function turn right in turn left we're adding plus then to move to turn it right just subtract the same thing like minus 20 and the same thing everything the remaining thing would be same right so now you have to bind these things to that keys so first obviously you have to call that listen method on this screen object and now we have screen dot on key so the function is first let's take move forward without these brackets and the key I'm going to bind with this is f right so same you have to bind all the keys okay for clearing the screen Also let's define a function named clear uncore screen right so you have to clear the drawing of the turtle to not any other Turtle so on Tom we have a method clear right and then Tom should be in home location means at 0 coordinate so there's a method home right but for that first of all obviously you have to do pen up otherwise it will draw a line while moving to the home location right and after moving to the home location just do pen down because again if you want to draw any sketch then it should be pen down this clear screen this method we have seen in previous video also right okay now okay now let's run this and see what is happening here so there's a turtle I'm moving forward I'm pressing F key so moving forward I'm pressing L key so I'll be moving in upward Direction in r c right L again or B like this then again L then right something like this right and if I press C then cleared all my drawing and all right so this is how you can do this kind of thing also right I hope you got this this exercise like this you can draw many shapes and you can just Define different different functions you can bind those functions with different different keys right on your keyboard and like this right so I hope you got this one now I'll see you in the next till then byebye take care
