so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise who is going to pay the bill in that we have used those random functions right now see when you deal with when you work with list or set or Tuple then generally we get this error index out of range error right so in this video we'll talk about this error what is this error how you can fix this error right now index out of range this error is not means what generally you are trying to access an index that is invalid I hope now you are aware about index let us take one example if we have a list something like this in this list I have three items one two three right so index of this would be index standard from zero in no for arrays also for list also in programming language generally index start from zero because it is shifting from starting this is starting offset from starting so this item is from starting shifting of the cells the offset of this item is zero nothing that is why it's zero it's not position like one two three no so 0 1 2 this is what index and how to access these elements suppose I want to access this pile this element or Jia then how you will access simply the name of the list and in square brackets just pass the index one and suppose I am passing this in a and I'm just printing a so it will give you gr but here this error is quite common when you want to access the last element of the list if you want to it's a spiral then which what index you will pass to right then it will give pile but generally what we do we pass suppose three like one two three so you are going to access the index which is invalid with the which doesn't exist in this list is 3 any index no so this time it will give index error the list index out of range right generally it occurs when we want to access the last element see here the list is having only three item but suppose list is having 60 item 100 item then obviously we will not count like 0 1 2 3 index something like this so same I know one simple logic is you can find out the length of the list right here if I want to find out the length of less the the length of the list then the function is simply Len and just pass names so this will give the length of the list and we can store this in a variable like length but the length of what it will give if you print length it will be one two three but here we cannot pass the directly length like this if you don't know how many items are there it will give index error index out of range error why because length is 3 but index start from 0 0 1 2 so index is length minus one so better you have to give Here length minus 1. this is how you can remove this right second case is if you are using negative index like minus one because in list negative indexing is allowed so if I write Here length name minus 1 it will print pile minus 2 minus 3 J but if you want to access the first element using negative index and if you write minus 4 then it will say mirror index of Fringe so we can say basically index error is an exception in Python which occurs when you try to access an element from the list right from the list or Tuple or set or strings also from the index which is not present in the list at that time index error race now let me just show you this thing with example practically I'll show you okay so let's create a new file here index underscore error.py and simply we will make a list of names so we have taken three elements see you can put these names into single quote also in Python it is allowed now if I want to access like if I want to print something like this directly using F string I am going to print right so I am printing names and at what index suppose index 1 index two and I'm just saying hi to whatever is there at this Index right so if I run this and see what you will get see it is printing High Gia right because at second index we have Gia what it if I rather than 2 if I write 3 here let me just show you now see now there this is what index error index list index out of range because 3 this index is not there in line number two in module this index error in line number two here this is there right so if rather than this I do something like this if the list is having 10 items like this suppose and list we are having these items so I don't know how many items are there maybe 50 60 items can be there so what we can do is we can find out the length of the list if you don't know right length of the list is suppose we have a function Len and in there just how to pass the this name of the list is names now we got the length of the list right but here it's not like that we can pass this length let's suppose you pass you are passing the length and maybe you get maybe you are thinking you will get high whatever the last element in the list like hi pradeep so let's run this and I'll show you what I'll put it again you are getting index error list out of index because length is what for this list one two three four five six seven right but the index starts from 0 0 to 6 so index for pradeep is six so if you want to access the last element length minus 1 and this time it will print hi pradeep right same for minus a negative indexing also if suppose I write here minus 7 see minus 7 then it will print gen High Journey because negative indexing start from minus 1 over to zero because minus 0 is nothing it's only zero not mine is zero that is why negative index start from I minus one so minus 1 to minus seven but if you want to access minus 8 then same index error you will get here so this is how like you will get index error and uh like why you are getting this index here and how you can fix it so I hope what is this index error and how to fix it is clear to you guys now in the next video we'll see nested list so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
