so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing loops in c plus plus in the previous video we have talked about for loop in c the basics and take general syntax what is for loop why we use this and all we have seen with their program right the execution the working of the four loop but it's not like that the way we have discussed in previous video in that way only you can write down four rupees yeah the syntax is that only but you can do some tricky things with that for loop or you can say some properties or four loop we are going to discuss in this video right in many ways you can write down for loop right generally in you know in exam in competitive exams like gate net and interview in y was they ask these type of questions they write down the for loop but they just add a twist in that for loop right which you haven't seen before maybe you think that it will give an error but no that will not give an error that will produce some output but you haven't tried that thing with that for loop because you don't know you have just tried on for loop four then initialization then condition then increment decrement and then body of the loop and that's it but there are multiple ways in which you can write down for loop so that all the things these tricky things what you can do with for loop those things will discuss in this video with the help of programs many examples will be seen on laptop practically we will see all these things right and i'll explain you why you are getting that kind of output and all some assignments also i'll give you right but before that i just want to tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate exam or will be preparing for gate exam then there is a great offer going on on an academy unlock 20. you will get twenty percent off on all the gate csit subscriptions but the software is valid you know till today only or you can say today is the last date to get to grab the sofa as you can see on my screen the details of gate csit subscriptions the durations and the current price and what you have to pay right as well as you will get twenty percent open uh that uh on academy light distance learning program you can see the detail on my screen whatever is your branch according to that you can check the detail and you can go for that thing and you can use my code jkl10 to get twenty percent off on all the subscriptions as well as for gay 23as parents they are going to start a new batch from 1st of september this batch will be in both indian hindi and english and also be given to you in english only and the top educator will be copying all the subjects of cs and id in this batch and some special classes will also be conducted discover you know discussing like preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts plus separate doubt solving session would also be conducted so you can you know get your doubts cleared in those separate sessions and see here you will get separate doubt solving sessions as well as uh the notes and live mentorship so i get you can go for this case if you are you know getting these points these are some benefits you will get if you go for an academic courses so uh all the relevant links and details you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see for loop see general syntaxes i have told you just write down four here we have expression one semicolon expression two semicolon expression three and we have body of loop right that's it and these three expression all the three expressions are optional means you can write down for loop something like this four semicolon semicolon please note on this thing all three expressions are optional right but these two semicolons are mandatory if you don't write down if you don't put semicolon if you put one semicolon it will give syntax error if you put three semicolon you will get syntax error only two semicolons only two semicolons are mandatory three expressions are optional right now in how many ways what tricky things you can do with this for loop let's discuss all these things all these things uh with the help of programs and i'll show you practical right so this was the example we have taken simply we we have printed in the last video numbers from one to ten okay we are taking this example from 1 to 5 we are printing so header file io stream that header their name space std then in main function we are just taking a variable i name of variable you can take any variable m a b c x y z i j k any variable generally we take i as a loop variable because you can say you know you can consider i is like a girlfriend for this loop so i initialization first i is equal to 1 then condition i less than equal to 5 termination condition and then increment or decrement or you can say update here you can write plus plus i or i plus plus both will work same then we are just printing i right so it will print 1 to 5 right 1 to 5. now see what are some condition you can do what are some you know tricky things you can do with this you can remove this initialization this is completely optional right but if you do not initialize this i then what output you'll get let's run this you will get nothing see it it is going to print nothing because maybe i will it will take any garbage value that would would be the condition would not be 2 at that time so it will not enter into this loop body and that's it so if after this loop body i print end of loop let's see what you will get see let's run this and see it is just printing end of loop because it is not entering into this loop body we are not initializing this so if you initialize the psi here one ways you can initialize this before this for loop rather than here so let's print let's run this and now you it will print one to five right okay initialization is done now uh if i initialize more than one initialization you can do like i is equal to 1 comma j is equal to 0 right but before taking this j you have to declare this j variable right otherwise it will give error okay fine now more than two initialization we have done i and j so you have to separate these initialization with coma not semicolon only two semicolons are allowed in this for loop only comma you can put if you put here semicolon if you separate these initialization with semicolon you will get an error syntax error let's run this and i'll show you what error you will get see uh here you will get an error like expected this before this semicolon so you have to remove this because it will consider these two semicolon as part of this four this is extra right first two are fine but it is giving error in third one but we know that this first semicolon is extra so just put comma here right now simply you can print here i as well as as well as j so if you print i and both j what output you will get c one zero two zero three zero four zero five zero i is one two three four five but j is zero zero zero because we are not incrementing or decrementing j right so more than one initialization also you can do now you can remove this condition this condition is also optional right so you can remove this condition fine we are not putting any condition it will not give any error but the loop would be just think if there is no condition then obviously loop would be in finite loop there is no termination condition so if i run this it will be an infinite loop see it will be an infinite loop okay so i'm going to kill this fine so incrementing it is printing one is incrementing 1 2 3 4 5 like this and j is 0 0 0 0 0 something like this and it is not going to stop so you have to put a condition i less than equal to 5 one more thing more than one condition also you can put now if i put two condition then you have to separate these two condition with comma only comma j less than suppose j less than 3 okay control s now what would be the case maybe you are thinking this loop would print or i don't know what you are thinking just try it out and see what output you are getting or before running just dry run this and see what output you are getting so here also it will give in finite loop why infinite loop let me just run this first and show you the output of this thing see it is still in finite loop and j is still at the last you can see the last digit 0 0 0 0 0 right j is always 0 i is only incrementing but it is still in finite low why so because if you put 2 condition then the last condition the second condition right would be considered as termination condition the first condition i less than equal to five five would be considered as a simple statement no condition if you put three condition i less than equal to five j less less than three suppose comma k less than equal to 10 then k less than equal to 10 would be considered as termination condition this point you need to take care right because comma is like the working of comma is what it will evaluate the first expression discard the value then second expression discard the value then third discard the value something like this i have discussed the working of coma operator you can check out that video right in the side button so same way it will discard the first value it will it will evaluate this one but i less than equal to five it would discard this like it will consider it as a statement only and the second one j less than five j less than three that will be considered as termination condition and you are not incrementing or decrementing j so j is always 0 the condition is always true so it is infinite loop now if i put here comma like j plus plus yeah at this time you will get c what output you will get here 1 0 2 1 3 2 right as soon as j value becomes 3 condition is not true so it is going to stop yeah i value is still 3 only and i value is less than equal to 5 so it can print four and five but it is not printing four and five because j value is the termination condition the condition is j less than three so national j as soon as j becomes three it is going to stop same you can put more than one condition with separation with coma and the last condition would be you know act as a termination condition if you do not put any condition it would be infinite loop same here also you can put more than one or two incremental decrement or update expression separated with comma right one more thing what if i put semicolon here at the last of this i sorry this four loop means you are terminating this for loop maybe you will think it will give error but it will not give any error so what output it will give c at the last it is printing 3 and 2 because once j value becomes 3 it will check the condition i value becomes 4 j value becomes 3 keep this thing in your mind i value becomes 4 j value becomes 3 in the memory already updated and after that condition would be checked 3 less than 3 not true so it will exit from this for loop but still in memory i value is what 4 and j value is 3 okay you got this point now let's run this let's run this code and see you are getting 4 and 3 it's not 43 i value is 4 and j value is 3 let me just do this things i equal 2 and will print i and then some space then j equal to let me just format this thing a little bit and then we print j now you will get it better see i value is 4 j value is 3 yeah you are putting a semicolon in for loop that is why this for loop you have terminated this for loop now this would not be considered as the loop body it would be considered as simply statement as a part of the program not part of low body keep this thing in your mind now yeah for loop will execute see first of all i value becomes one j is zero condition true condition true obviously one condition would be checked j less than three condition true i plus plus j plus plus i becomes two j becomes one condition true but will not enter into this loop body because you have terminated this for loop so simply i plus plus j plus plus will be executed now i becomes 1 j becomes i becomes 2 j becomes 1 condition would be checked again j less than 3 yes condition 2 again plus plus again condition would be checked see this was the case ah 1 0 at first time ah then it was 2 1 then it becomes 3 2 but it is not printing at this point of time because you have terminated this for loop now after that i value becomes four j value becomes three in the memory already updated i value becomes four j value becomes three now check the condition is the condition true j less than three less than three no this would be the termination condition so now exit from this for loop now exit from for loop means this statement is now not part of this loop body it is part of the program so it will execute this statement now so at this point of time i value is in the memory i value is 4 and j value is 3 so it is printing only one thing so these are some tricky things we can do with this loops right but if i put this j plus plus here j plus plus this you can also do increment decrement or this update kind of thing you can put in this loop body rather than here rather than here i plus plus and as well as j plus plus you can put here both the things right but this point it would be in finite loop why so because you have terminated this for loop and this would not be considered as part of this loop so i plus plus j plus plus would not be executed right now j value becomes zero always and condition would always be true yeah it will not print anything on the screen but it would be an infinite loop see let me just show you i hope you are getting my point see it is just running it isn't just running just running but it is not printing anything on the screen because the control is still in this loop right the condition is always true and it is it is not coming out from the loop so that is why it is not printing anything so let me just kill this terminal and see now if if suppose i put j plus plus here only j plus plus here and i plus plus here what output you will get let's try around this and see what we are getting right let's pause the video and you can just try around this and see what output you are getting let me just run this and show you what output you will get here here i is equal to 1 and j is equal to 3 why so because i plus plus is in here so this would not be considered as part of this loop body so i would always be 1 i would not be implemented j is only incremented from 0 then 1 then 2 and then 3 becomes then condition will not be true and it will print only j 0 is equal to 1 right so i hope you are getting my points and see one more thing if you you do something like this only two semicolon i have told you all the three expressions are optional you can remove this but two semicolons are compulsory just two semicolon it would be an infinite loop because there is no termination condition right let's run this let's run this see it would be an infinite loop in finite loop j is any garbage value because we are not initializing this j and i is 1 so i is also like maybe incrementing or we can we cannot do see i plus plus because you are writing here i plus plus so it is incrementing right but it would be an infinite loop so better to use for loop carefully okay with some proper condition and if i write here something like this like j is equal to 1 semicolon i less than equal to 5 semicolon and i plus plus i am printing i and j okay so what output you will get in this case see see it carefully i am initializing here j right so let me just remove this line this initialization i am not initializing i anywhere i am just initializing j so what output you will get here let me just remove this i plus plus also from here okay so now see what output you will get let's run this and show you you will get no output in this case just it will print end of loop end of loop whatever statement you will write out of this loop that would be printed why so because you are you are not initializing i anywhere you are putting condition on i you are putting i plus plus but you know you haven't initialized i so it will give no output right and if i do something like this rather than i plus plus we can also do something like this i plus 2 like i plus equal to 2 and let's initialize this i and i less than equal to suppose 10 okay now let us run this and suppose j i am initializing here 9 let's run this it will print i one three five seven nine because it is incrementing i by two this time so rather than plus plus or this thing you can do some expression also like i plus equal to two i plus you know you can do i is equal to y divided by 2 i is equal to y into 2 this kind of thing you can do okay and i minus minus also you can do like 10 to 1 if you want to print so i is equal to 10 and now this time condition would be i greater than equal to 1 and this time we will do i minus minus okay suppose we are not printing j we are printing only i fine so let's run this and what it will it will print 109876 something like this so decrement also you can do so here in the condition i am writing something like this i less than equal to 40 logical or operator and j less than 10 now these are not two condition we have combined this with logical or operator so this is this will be considered as one condition only right so you know the truth table of logical or if any one is true it would be true right so you just try out this thing first dry run this and see what output you are getting then run this let's run this and show you what output you are getting say this is the thing you will get here okay so now this would be considered as one condition only it's not like that now j less than equal to 10 10 is termination condition only and j i less than equal to 40 is only statement no you have combined this thing this is one condition only right so rather than logical or you can write down here logical and also these kind of expressions these kind of things you can also do with this condition right so i hope every single detail every point about for loop is clear to you guys now my next video will discuss while loop and do while loop so i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
