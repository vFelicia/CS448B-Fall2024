You all must have heard this " do that work you are interested in " If you have interest u won't need MOTIVATION , you will be happy while working and If you don't have interest leave it BUT suppose you have started new job or you have started studying so sometimes you don't have interest in your job or study from the first day but it doesn't mean you leave your job or don't study..see if you start watching any web series and first and second episodes are boring but still u keep watching and think may be third episode will have some twist and make it interesting ..and it happens sometimes that from third episode that series becomes interesting to you.. Same goes with your job and study.. push yourself a little bit and have patience ... may be after one month or two months that same job or study becomes interesting to you guys..
