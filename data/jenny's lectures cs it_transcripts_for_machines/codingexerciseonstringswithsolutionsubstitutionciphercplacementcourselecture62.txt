hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing strings in C++ in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise based on strings that was very simple one and in this video we'll see one more coding exercise that is a little bit difficult right because we are going to make a substitution Cipher here right we're going to encrypt a message and decrypt a message like we generally do uh when we talk uh with our especially friends then we uh use some code language or sign language so that no one can understand our message right these kind of things right so that that's exactly we are going to implement in this video with the help of what like obviously we are going to use strings here so what you are given is like uh you are given those alphabets letters from a to zed in capital letter and small letter and corresponding to that letters you are going to given a key right like a would be replaced here the keys with capital zed B would be replaced with capital Y like this this is a simple just an example the key can be anything right yeah Subs Sher is not so strong so you know hackers can heck this and easily Deer uh the text or decrypt the text right but it's just an example in this example we are going to take only letters small and capital letters but you you can uh make this uh project little bit complicated you can take numbers also 1 2 3 4 5 like this and special characters like space or those um apostrophe and these kind of things also you can take right and corresponding to those uh letters or those characters also we can take a key like space would be replaced with maybe atate one would be replaced with maybe zero like this right so I'm just starting with a simple example right we'll just here decrypt or encrypt and decrypt only letters I'm taking you can update it a little bit you can modify it a little bit right so you are given those alphabets and the key right and what should be the output see let me show you so output would be some something like this it will ask enter your message so suppose I'm entering any message like hi like there's a meeting at 10 a.m. tomorrow right so it will show you something like this like encrypted message is this okay see one 10 is as it is the suppos stop is as it is space is as it is we are just encrypting here at initial stage only alphabets right and then decrypt the message and see this is the decrypted message whatever we have sent right so this should be output the output right at simple at initial stage so I hope you got what is this problem statement and what you have to do right now what you are given is this thing you are given those alphabets you can not down this thing these alphabets would be replaced with these keys right so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this see this is you are given one spring is alphabet and here we have small ABCD from a to zed and capital A to Z Now the key is this small a would be rep replaced with this capital z z small B would be replaced with capital Y right this is the key in reverse order I'm taking like small ABCD are replaced with capital ABCD in reverse order and small Capital ABCD up to Z would be replaced with small ABCD in reverse order right key can be anything it's not like that you have to take this key only this is some simple example I'm taking here rather than z y uh X you can take like RP MN or these kind of thing right but yeah this should be replaced with some another character or rather than a b CD you can take a would be replaced with one B would be replaced with the two something like this T can be anything right okay now one thing is what what you will do is simple approach we can take like a message is suppose I'm this is the message hi jny that's it so one thing we can do is this H we will search we will find here in this alphabet in this string where is this H the position Capital H right Capital H is here now at that position same position what is the character in this key that you need to find and just replace this H with that character simple this thing you need to do and while decrypting just take that encrypted message what is that encrypted message right and same search from starting search for first character where is that character in this key in this key in this string right find out the position and at same position what is the character in this string alphabet just replace that with that character or that alphabet and that would be decrypted message I hope you're getting right so now you can pause the video and try this out if you haven't done this okay let's see let's ask from user we will take first like obviously I'll take a string message MSG or secret message right and this thing you can take or simply you can take this an empty string message right now ask from user enter your message we cannot take this message with the help of cing because we are going to take a complete line with space Also and see will not take a complete line as input as soon as it will see a it will get a space it is going to stop taking input so we'll take which function we have a get line function to take a complete line as an input right so get line and first argument of this get line is in from where you are taking that input and in which um the variable you are going to store in which string variable you're going to store that message so that we are having string message so C in and next is message this is get line okay three argument also we can uh take here like a special dter you can give in this get line like whenever you will enter if I'm taking a if you write here like message comma space t so whenever you will enter small T it is going to stop taking input right but this thing we don't want here we just want a complete complete line as soon as you will enter uh you will press enter or you will give a new line as an input it is going to stop taking input right now we have taken input now what should be the process so suppose message is this only High Jenny or suppose message is this let's take a simple message like a a b b space c c this is our message so first character will take a then we'll find the position of this a in alphabet right so better to take here a range based for Loop right that would suit here in this uh you know in this exercise so we'll take care C and from where from message so message is a a space BB space c c so first a would be assigned to this C now in C we have a so let's search this a small a in this alphabet so how to search in string we have discussed a function that is find it will give the position right the first occurrence where is that you that character or where is that particular also you can search a string also here but here we are searching only a character so from alphabet we are searching so I have to call this alphabet dot find this one and what you want to find C whatever is there in this C position of that so it will return the position right let me show you what the find me uh this meaning of this find function is see see this find this find will return it will search the string for the first occurrence of the sequence specified by which argument but rather than that string we are just searching a character individual character also we can search right and it will return the position right let me show you the return value return value the position of the first character of the first match right but if no match is found then it will return NP NP means uh like let me show you unsuccessful search it represent like unsuccessful search uh here NP this is having the value minus one right so if you use this NPS as a return value means it usually used to indicate no matth is found okay this constant is defined with a value of minus one which because and the uh that data type of this is size uncore T it means it is unsigned integral type right rather than int or anything we take size uncore T here it will return the position so equal to position and data type of this position is rather than taking int or anything let's take this only size underscore T it's unsigned integral type right so better to take this okay size d and here we have position position equal to alphabet do find this thing okay now we have got the position of this a now at same position what is the character what is the alphabet or character in this string key that you have to find out okay so first check if position if this position is that npos means no match is found in that case if suppose I have given here space so there is no match this space of this page space in this alphabet right so it will give no npos no matches found so as it is space would be there in encrypted message or if you write here one as it is one would be in encrypted message because we are not going to encrypt this one we are just taking this a BCD letters only right so let's put that condition if this position not equal to string npos this is how we are going to check right semicolon here if this position is not equal to this means yes there is no unsuccessful search we got the position right if you got the position then we search in this key at the same position what is the character so how to fetch that thing from key from this key this string key dot at and let's give whatever the position you have got so it will give a character from this so that character we are going to store in a obviously in a new variable so let's take a care type newcore c a new variable new C we got that character corresponding to a from the ski so let's put that encrypted character to that message encrypted message let's take uh obiously we have to take another variable encrypted message another string string variable encrypted message and and encrypted message plus equal to this new C okay but if sorry else if position is npos me means no match found so as it is in encrypted message we will append that character C suppose here we have space after a we have space so there's no match found here so as it is space would be added to to this encrypted message right so C would be added otherwise whatever the new character you got from Key string that would be added okay so after this for Loop let's print here the that encrypted message so you do that this thing only first encrypt the message let's run this and see enter your message so a a BB c c and suppose 1 2 and suppose here we are taking d g or any apostrophe or anything okay so encrypted messages z z y y XX one 2 is same apostrophe s is same this apostrophe is same okay so this is the encrypted message according to the given key now same logic this logic you have to apply to decrypt the message again so if you got this thing you can easily write down the code for decription please if you're not getting this pause the video again Watch the video dry in this code just write down this on your paper right with pen dryer and this and find out right and please please write down the that code for decryption pause the video and try this out right so now we will decrypt the message now again range based for Loop we have care C now we are going to take character by character from we have that encrypted message so from encrypted message right and find out the position of that encrypted message suppose encrypt message is for a a it's z z for BB it's y y so this message we have okay so first we have Zed in this C so find out the position of this Zed in key and corresponding to same position you have to find out what is the alphabet what is the letter in that string alphabet okay and just add that into another string decrypted message okay so first let's find out the position same we will take this uh data type that is size d and we are finding position equal to now that encrypted sorry key dot key do find and whatever the character C from Key we are going to find the position right same we will check if that position is not equal to npos means search is successful in that case corresponding to that position in alphabets in that string alphabet dot at at this position what is the letter in the that alphabet string right that character we are going to fetch and new C in a new C this character variable we will store that right and let's take another string that is decrypted message in decrypted message we are going to append whatever is that sorry new character new C whatever you have find out from this string alphabet okay lse if search is not successful means position is npos in that case as it is decrypted message plus equal to whatever that c what whatever that character see because if space is that character obviously that would be as it is added to deed message so that is C that's it after this for Loop we'll just print that decrypted message so I hope you got this let's run this and see what output you are getting okay you got something wrong here yes here also we have this let's on this let's take a demo thing to check a a b b 1 2 3 encrypted messages z z y y1 23 only and again the decrypted messages same okay let's run the send see again like um same like this is that encrypted message and this is again decrypted message right so this is the initial at this project is at initial stage we are just encrypting that uh letters only so you can update this you can take numbers also 1 2 3 4 and some special character also space for space also you can like if I update this alphabet in this alphabet I have one space Also and space would be replaced with like maybe at theate so let's run this and see what output you're getting now see a a space BB see z z and at the place of space we have at the rate right so like this you can update this alphabet and key according to that key you can provide so I hope you got this this was not so much tough please if you're if you haven't got this just write down this on a piece of paper and dry run this code right and after that modify this code add some numbers also special special characters also right now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see what are functions in C++ now I I'll see in the next bye take care
