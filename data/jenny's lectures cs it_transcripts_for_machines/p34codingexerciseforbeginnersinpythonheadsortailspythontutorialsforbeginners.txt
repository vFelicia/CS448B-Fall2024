so in the series of learning Python programming language the previous video was about randomization we have discussed random module how to generate random numbers integers floating numbers and all right now based on that we'll do one coaching coding exercise now uh it's like virtual coin toast program when you toss a coin then you will get either heads or tails so same program will write and then you will tell the user heads or tails now what you have to assume like zero means tails and one means heads so simply generate a random number either 0 or 1 and based on that you can tell heads or tails simple program is there I hope you got this what is the problem statement right now pause the video and try this program so I hope you have done this now let's create a new file and scoring exercise 11 right so simply first of all obviously you have to import random module right so in this case now generate a random number between or you can say either 0 or 1 so what you can use for that what function Rand hint we can use right so how you will use that function the module name Dot the function is Rand end and just provide the range 0 to 1 both 0 and 1 are included right so whatever it will return that we are going to store suppose in a variable any variable uh like we can say sign side of that coin right random side or side any variable name you can take a b c also find x y z right now obviously you have to put some condition if 0 then tells otherwise heads so we can put some condition like if this side equal to equal to suppose one it means you can simply print heads we are assuming one means heads else I hope you are familiar with this effects because we have discussed this thing how to use if else in Python otherwise things that's it this is the simple program right now let me just run this and see this time we are getting heads again heads this time you are getting Tails right and if you want to play to the side also then uh here you can print like if you want to check print side let's run this see side is one that is why heads right one again heads one same you are getting so it is possible that you can get more than one time saying now this time C Tails zero entails right so this is the simple program so in the next video we'll see one more coding exercise that would be a little bit complicated than this one so now I will say in the next video till then bye bye take care
