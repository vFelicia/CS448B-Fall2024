so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing operators in Python till now we have discussed arithmetic operator assignment operator comparison operator and logical operators the next test is bitwise operator so these operators will be discussing in this video okay which are bitwise operators like what are bitwise operators how to use them with help of example program will be seeing the working of bitwise operators and I'll show you on my laptop also right the notes of this lecture you will get in the description box of this description box of this video I'll put the link you can click there click on that link and you will get the notes for this class okay now see as the name suggests to bit twice operators so these operators works on bits you can say binary numbers like same in C and C plus plus also we have discussed midwise operators so they work on bits actually they used to operate on binary numbers on bits now how they are going to operate first of all let me tell you what are bitwise operators we have bitwise and bitwise over exhort then we have complement or you can say not then we have left shift and then we have right shift so these are bitwise operator so first of all we are discussing the working of bitwise and operator see let's see we have a is equal to 5 and B is equal to 4 rather than in two lines you can do assignment in one line only okay now if I want to print like print A and B I want to do a and b this end is for bitwise and so the sand is going to perform on the bits not on these numbers so first of all convert the these numbers into binary numbers so now a becomes what 5 is 1 0 1 and B is what four or zero zero or generally we represent numbers means these decimal numbers in either 4 bits or eight bits so let's represent in four bits okay now I hope you know five is one zero one like or you can say you can calculate this one two four eight something like this so four plus one is five and four this is four at the place of four only we have one only right so now do bitwise and bitwise and means same if both are one then only it will give one otherwise zero so one zero zero zero zero zero one one both are one it will give one zero zero zero so now convert this number into decimal number this would be 4. so the answer would be okay so bitwise and same will give if both are 1 then only it will give one otherwise 0. okay now let's see we have the twice over the next is bitwise over a is this B is this so bitwise or now what is the result of this thing the twice over means it will give 0 if both are 0. if anyone is one any one of the bit is one equal give one so one zero one zero zero zero one one one and zero zero zero so now convert this into decimal number it would be five so the result of this would be five logical and sorry these are bitwise now bitwise xor what would be without C bit wise xor now bitwise xor means what if both the bits are same then it will give zero it will give one only if bits are different let's see two bits one one xor zero one example zero both bits are different so it will give one zero zero both bits are same zero one one both bits are same so it will give zero zero zero both bits are same so it will give zero so the decimal of this is what 1 so it will give one so I hope you got working of bitwise and or an xor now this is little bit tricky so let's understand this complement operator now if you print if you do negation of a and if you print this thing it will give you K is 5 so negation of 5 it will give you minus 6. how you are getting minus 6 this is little bit tricky now let's see this not node will reverse the bits if bit is one it will be zero if it is 0 it will be one so now let's see negation of 5 5 in binary we have 0 1 0 1 in 4 bits I am representing the number okay one zero this is Phi now negation of 5 would be reverse the bit 0 1 0 1 so this would be negation of 5. now what are this one zero one zero maybe if you apply that logic like 1 1 2 4 8 you will say it is 10. so it should give 10 not minus six but how we are getting minus six C it is not ten we are getting minus 6 so see we cannot store negative numbers actually in memory okay we have to convert this into positive number so yeah there is a method to store negative numbers in memory now what is that method two's complement we have to find out two's complement of the number then we can store that negative number into computer memory okay so this is minus 6. if you are going to store this minus 6 into computer memory first of all convert into positive number find out the two's complement now two's complement is what two's complement is once complement plus one I guess you are aware about these things if you ever I think red Boolean algebra in that we have these kind of things or in basics of programming also computer programming also in the first chapter we have these things or in digital electronics one subject is there with that also we have these things so two's complement is once complement plus one this is one's complement like one apostrophe s this is a post office now how to calculate one's complement once complement we can get simply by reversing the digits means if there is one reversing the bits sorry not digits bits if one then zero if zero then one okay now we have to find out whose complement of 6 so 6 in binary how we represent 6 in binary this is what 1 1 0 4 bits I'm taking so this is six like one two four eight four plus two is six okay now once complement of six just reverse the bits one zero zero one now two's complement add one had one so you know I hope you know binary Edition binary addition one plus one is zero plus carry one so one plus one is zero carry one so one plus zero is one zero then one so two's complement is this one see binary addition of is 0 plus 0 would be zero zero plus one one one plus zero one one plus one it would be 0 with carry 1 with carry 1 okay so now two's complement of this is one zero one zero this is how we store 6 and this is exactly negation of five one zero one zero that is why we got negation of 5 is minus 6. always so simple method is what negation of any number like negation of 10. if you will do simply you will get that number plus 1 with minus sign so it will you will you will get minus 11. okay I hope you would have these this thing works okay why we are getting the result of this like this not or this complement we say it complement also this complement operator something like this I hope you got this thing now okay now next is left shift see this is also very interesting now if I left shift this a left shift two okay so it is going to left shift the First operand with respect to Second operand so first operand is a a is 5 so we are going to left shift 5 by 2 bits this is what bits here you can write down one three four five any number of bits you can write down it's not like that you have to write them only okay now a a is 5 so 5 in binary we have one zero one where we write it as one zero one zero one this is 5. now left shift by two bits means this side we are going to shift by two bits okay so here we are not going to discard the maybe you will say just left shift by two bits discard these two bits so 0 1 and add two zeros at the right hand side the remaining places we will add will fill those places with zero so this would be the case no no no no we are not going to discard these bits remember this thing okay so left shift would be what we are going to Simply add left shift two bits like zero one zero one so here we have places of two bits remaining so simply add 0 0. see generally if I write 5 so it is 5.0 2 means 2.0 with floating Point number after floating point also we have something zero zero zero zero or something like this okay now so if you left shift this this you can say zero zero zero this sign if you are going to left chip this these two zeros would be shifted to this one we are not going to discard these two bits we will keep these two bits okay if zeros are there you can discard zeros like if in eight bits I represent five zero zero zero zero zero one zero one in eight bits this would be five in this case we simply can say because these are zeros zeros you can discard simply we can say left shift these this side so discard these two zero so this zero would be at this place now this would be at this place here we have 0 here we have one here we have zero one now remaining two places will fill these places with two zeros that can be a case but here in four bits two bits are zero and one we cannot discard this one otherwise we will get some unexpected result okay so in left shift we always gain bits we are not going to lose anything okay I hope you got my you know logic here so now see so this you will get after left shift by two so now what is this decimal number one two four eight sixteen thirty two something like this so 16 plus 4 20. so this would be 20. simply the formula is what if you left shift like X as a number if you are going to left shift this number with n Bits so what output you will get this X into 2 raised to power n see here x is 5 into 2 raised to power 2. it would be 4 that is 5 into 4 that is 20. okay this is the left chip now what about right shift C if we right shift this e by 2 then what is it you will get now a is what 0 1 0 1 okay now right shift by 2 we are going to right shift by two bits in this case we will lose bits we are going to discard so right shift by two bits so these two bits would be discarded so here we have this one would be at this place this 0 would be at this place now these two bits these two places would be filled with zero so this would become now one so the answer would be 1. in this case in right shift we will discard the bits means we are going to lose the bits but in left shift we gain bits we don't lose I hope you got this thing okay because there's two bits maybe you can see after decimal we have zero zero so these two which would be after decimal so we are going to discard these two bits so if left if right if you buy three then three bits we are going to discard so this is 0 will be at this place the remaining three bits would be full of the zero so the answer would be zero okay now here we have answer one so simple formula is if x would be right shift by n Bits then the answer would be x divided by 2 raised to power n so here x is 5 5 divided by 2 raised to power 2 that is 1 5 divided by 4 that is 1 okay so this is right shift so I guess you got the working of these Operator Let me just show you practically we will see this thing practically and then I'll give you one exercise also okay okay now we will take this here we will take two variables A5 and B 4. so we are going to just print a bit wise and B okay let's see what output you will get here you will get four if you print a bit y zor B in that case what you will get you are getting 5 here you are getting 5. now if I print let's try with xor Axor B the last one will get 1 right and we simply print not a what you can say complement a this is bitwise note or you can say complement so this will give you minus 6. not B would be your assignment if you print not B then what it will print you have to try if I print like a left shift by two bits so then you will get what it would be 20 see it would be 20 and if I print like a right shift by 2 what you will get it would be 1 see the last it would be 1. so if you are aware about you know if you got the working of these operators you can try out with different different operate you know different different values and all paste or like that you can only try with five and four you can it's not like that you have to left shift or write it by two bits you can have you can do with one weight or three beat five weight four bit up to you so now I'll give you one assignment so this is for your assignment you have to tell what would be the result of these things okay rather than simply just you know going to do your ID your laptop and just print these things no no first of all try out at your own without your laptop then run this this thing on your laptop like print print and you can tell you an answer so this 26 and 23 17 or 24 17 EXO 24 negation or you can say complement 45 not 45 68 left shift by 2 bits 56 right shift by three bits so I guess you can do this you are aware about these bitwise operators now so now two special operators are remaining intd and membership operator those thing we will discuss in next video so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
