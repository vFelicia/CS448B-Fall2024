so we have seen shorthanded appearance in python in the previous short we have seen But one important point is what you can use that shorthand difference if you have only one statement one within that if one within that else block but one more point about shorthand equals what in that way single line you can use multiple if so this was our program even a road number that we have written in shorthand if and something like this but now because I want to calculate which number is two numbers are there so three cases can be there either a b two numbers greater both are equal so how you will write down these three cases in single line see so here I have two number A and B six and six so what you will write first of all if condition so first of all what is if block statement a is data if then condition a greater than b else now maybe a equal to equal to B so print a equals B then again we can write if if and the condition a equal to equal to B and again we can write down else and Sprint B is greater so more than else also we can write down in a c
