okay so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen about uh you know basics of functions right and we have seen one exercise also now based on that we'll be doing one coding exercise in this video right so it's like uh you can say hurdle race right on that uh you know website or near ebooks world now see what first of all I'll tell you I'll show you what kind of output you want like it is what kind of quiz or you can say what kind of exercise it is let's see okay when you search Federal race in Reeboks world then there will be these links so you can click on the first link hurdle race this should be opened and now here this is not we want to choose this is what see here we have it's huddle three but we have to choose huddle one first right hurdle one this is the race so now a robot should move something like this you know these are some hurdles till the final point right now let me just show you if I run this what output which how this should be executed see this robot will move something like this right and it will reach till the gold so now you know like you have only move function and turn left function here right in build so now what function you need may be turn right or turn around you have to define those function yourself or whatever you have used till now like uh maybe Loops for Loop and range function those you have to use and you have to write down a python code and at last it should show something like this this is revoke as is at correct Exposition correct y position right so pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have tried this out now let's see first of all this robot should move one step forward so yeah we have that function for that inbuilt function here we can use that function move right now this robot should move in upward Direction so means turn left for that also we have one function turn left okay right till now now turn left means after turning left it should move one step upward so again move right now here we are see execute this line by line then turn left then move now here we are so here robot it should move turn right should we turn right and then move so now we don't have any function it will function turn right right so you have to Define your own function in the previous video we have defined our function turned right so you can watch out that video so let's define that function first because if you don't Define for turn right why how this robot would be done you know take a turn right turn from here three left turn we can use and then ultimately it would be turned right right so Whenever there would be turn right there you have to use three statement turn left turn left ten turn left so rather than writing these three statements again and again just Define take a function define that function turn right right and here three times turn left would be there right so and this should be indented right now this is our turn right function so whenever you want your command you give the command to robot turn right just call this function turn right and automatically these three line will be executed you don't need to write down repeat this word again and again turn right turn right and right right now after moving turn left then move then turn right so now turn right after turn right see carefully one move there should be one move then again turn right turn right then again move after moving now see till now let's run this one by one line by line This step through button then now first move then now cursor is at turn left so turn left then move then turn right now turn right function would be called so control is here so first turn left second turn left third turn turn left now we are we have turned right now again move then again turn right then again function would be called three times turn left turn left on left and left now we have turned right the robot then one move now we are at this position right so if here if you think we can just try down move and it will move in forward Direction then you are wrong one more move and let's now again run this see the error is ouch I hit a wall because the robot is at this you know faces towards the wall so you have to move this robot first in this forward Direction the you know face will be in this direction so we have to move this means movement uh we have to give an instruction to robot to turn left now rather than move so turn first turn left and then again move then turn left then move turn right move same these steps would be repeated again right so these steps would be repeated for this hurdle then this hurdle then this then this then this then this right one two three four five six seven eight steps okay now let's eight times we have to move so let's one one way is just copy paste these steps eight times okay so now total we have six number of times we have to write down these lines so let's run this and see what output you will get now now for this simple task we have return of 53 lines of code program right just a simple task I am damn sure in your mind now you have an idea you can reduce these number of lines why we are repeating the same lines again and again we have what we have a concept functions right so see now the same output we are getting but you have to reduce the number of lines so what we can do we can define a function and just pack these wrap up these steps which we are using again and again over and over again in that entity or in that function and just call that function right okay now let's delete these only one time you will be keeping these number of lines and just Define a function define maybe it can be jump or like walk or jump any function work right now the problem is under these function this should be indented otherwise it will give error so press control plus that right square bracket so now these are indented okay now we can call this function walk function how many times one two three four five six times and that's it okay let's call this function six times okay now we have called this function six times let's run this program again and if you want to check out like if you want to debug this then rather than just click on that play button you can just click on the next button to this step button right that will show you step by step how this program is going to be executed means you can debug this program using that option right so now see that's it we are done right but still we have 20 lines of code now see again and again we are calling the function six times right maybe these hurdles are 50 so you have to call this function 50 times so that is not a good idea we have loops right if you want to repeat the same thing and again and again we have loots for that so rather than writing this function six times what we can do we can just write down a for Loop because how many times you want to execute right now we know the iteration in the certain one two three four five six times the same steps I want to repeat six times this function work so I know number of iterations how many time I want to repeat right so just use for for Loop 4i in we have function range sixth number I want to generate so just provide 6 here so it will generate what 0 1 2 3 4 5. 6 numbers starting from zero right and then within this for Loop just call this work function right now run this and see the same output you will get here so that's it see now at first we are having 53 lines of code and now we are having only 17 or maybe if you remove the space then only 15 lines of code right so this says I guess the benefit of using functions it will reduce the number of lines increase the code you know reusability and obviously the readability of the code right now this is what hurdle one exercise for you guys so foreign you can try the you can try these adults also right we will also be discussing in later videos these adults so now I hope you got this exercise right and you can easily code this thing right in this Reeboks world so now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see one more hurdle so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
