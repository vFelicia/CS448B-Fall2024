hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in this video I am going to discuss about one of the best and free way to start your programming journey by learning C plus plus language yes now you can start your programming journey and take your preparation preparation from basic to advanced level by enrolling in guided path of C plus plus by code Studio and you can Master the topics like input and output some introduction first of all introductory topics input and outputs Advanced topic like input and outputs in C plus plus Loops conditional statements control structures if it fails these type of statements then arrays strings oops concept these type of topics from basic to advanced level all the topics will be covered okay now maybe you are thinking why you should enroll in this guided path of C plus plus given by code Studio so all the relevant links you will find in the description box of this video you can check out now let me just tell you why you should go for this guided path first thing the guided paths you know covers all the topics from basic to advanced level in a structured way with notes detailed in nodes should be given to you and then some practice questions also some mcqs and practice questions on all the topics covered okay so you will find notes of that topic as well as some practice questions also followed by the nodes right second thing all the important topics would be covered in this guided paths like some introductory topics like macros you know commands how to implement code in C plus plus then some Advanced topics input and output arrays strings oops Concepts Loops you know conditional statements all the these topics would be covered okay third thing average time would be taken to complete this kind of path is 25 days and not only this after completing this you will get a certificate also precertificate also after completing 80 percent of this course so you can unlock this certificate free certificate once you complete the 80 of this guiding path now let me just show you how to login how to go for this credit path what would be there in this you know the modules and all let me just tell you how to download the certificates right see okay now first of all see how to login see the link I'll put in the description box of this video you just go to that link when you whenever you will click on that link this should be opened right and first of all you have to login right so there would be a button login you can click on you can start with code Studio with Google or Facebook account or you can just enter your email address right and then after that just continue button would be there you can continue then in OTP you will get an OTP on your email address given a email address and then you can log in right after that you will get guided paths tap you can just click on that and there you will get basic or basics of C plus plus one guided path basics of C plus plus right you can just click on that right see let me just show you first if you go to this like if I click on guided paths then all the guided parts are there right and here you will get basics of C plus plus this guided path and you can just click on start learning right this should be opened now let me just first of all show you the modules basically in this there are 12 models total 12 modules are there then start from introductory topics then Advanced topics so now first module is we have introduction to C plus plus in this you will get features of C plus plus uses of C plus plus how to implement a code macros comments right like whenever you click first on the first you know tab basics of C plus plus first of all you will get notes right these are some nodes then features of C plus plus use of C plus plus you can click on these how to implement code in C plus plus right you will get nodes first of all of that topic after completing that topic like here you will we will have headers then main function then compile and run macros and comments in first module these are the topics right after completing first module you will have mcqs okay whenever you click on mcqs then including header file this McQ then multiline commands and McQ on this topic then weekly type language McQ 3 are there right whenever you click on this you will get an question you will you know select your right answer and submit okay whenever you will submit I haven't login so first of all I've told you you have to login to attempt this thing so first of all login right and after that go to this guided path right see now you can see second module is what see here after first model you will have 30 points of mcqs right now second module is variables and data types so in this module what you will get what are variables first of all if you then introduction to data types then what are data types different data types and scope of variables type of variables and type casting plus see whenever you click on anything like I'm I'm going to click on the first tab introduction to variable attempt right so first you will get notes see introduction to variables these are some nodes right after that you will get these are this this is what interaction to variables then questions mcqs invalid variable valid variables two questions are there two mcqs are there right then same introduction to data type whenever you click on this then let's click on introduction you will get notes and then questions so detailed nodes followed by practice questions you will get right next same third module is what in third module you will have input and output in C plus plus say motor input and output in C plus plus then mcqs and then practice problems also right let's click on this practice problems they will be given some problem and here you can write down your solution you can run code you can submit your code right in any language like if you are learning C plus plus obviously you will select C plus plus right so here you can write down your code you can run your code and you can submit so these are some practice problems also here first is find area of rectangle then print name and age swap two numbers calculate simple interest these are some practice problems so they are having some points also right fourth modulus operators in C plus plus now first of all introduction to operators and all the type of operators arithmetic so first you will get the theory of arithmetic operators then mcq's questions of 40 points then urinary operator relational logical Operator bitwise Operator all the type of operators has been explained right then Loops conditional statements same first of all you will get notes detailed nodes and then problems in this module you will get 28 problems and points are also given okay for each topic first like functions in C plus plus also here also you will get first of all what are function type of functions parameters function overloading and then practice problems like this we have 12 modules pointers and memory allocation then arrays then strings then oops Concepts four main concept like obstruction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism so we have these concept also classes and objects mcqs and practice problems Constructor Destructor this pointer shall you and deep copy then encapsulation inheritance excess specify as polymorphism abstraction interfaces all those Concepts has been explained with some practice problems exception handling exceptional handling and last STL in C plus plus so these are 12 modules in this guided path of C plus plus right and after this you will get a certificate also free certificate now you can download that certificate after completing 80 percent of this guided path see you have to score 80 percent without penalty then you can without penalty you can download this certificate this should be unlocked right so like this and average time to complete is 25 days and what are prerequisite basic aptitude you need to know to learn the C plus plus language this guided path right as you can see I have shown you you will find all the topics of C plus the course you can say a structural way in a structure where you will get the these topics and the notes and then practice problems also mcqs also so I think if you are you know a beginner and you are you are searching for this kind of thing rather than jumping from this video tutorial to this video tutorial because somewhere you will get notes somewhere you will get videos but no you know practice questions here you will get all the things Under One Roof so it would be better to go for the square path and best thing is what it is free so all the relevant links and details you will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out and if you find this video helpful for you guys please let me know in the comment section now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
