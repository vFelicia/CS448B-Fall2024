so in the series of learning cpus programming language we are discussing fundamental data type in c plus plus till now we have discussed in float double care white character these are types like so now we will be discussing two more data in built in air type that is bool and voided type in c plus plus like everything about these data types like what is bool what is void how to use them when to use them the application in which situation we should use void and bold airtimes everything up with the help of a program we will discuss about these stereotypes see until c99 wasn't bool was not a data type in c but yet it was introduced in c also after c 99 wasn't right but in c plus plus we have these bool and void data type right so we'll be discussing these things uh in this video see as we know that c plus plus is still one of the most popular programming language in industry still they have demand of you know the candidates who are you know good in c plus programming language and as we have seen that there is high demand of candidates who are equipped with technical and industrial skills so it is important for students to start acquiring these skills in early stage of your academic journey many students have been asking me about like colleges only you know focus theoretical on theory they don't provide practical knowledge right so we just have a degree we don't have that industrial skills here we don't don't have that practical skills that is actually required in you know industries and that is true if you want to sit in a hightech company in the interview of a hightech company yes degree just an eligibility criteria to sit in the interview but in interview they will analyze you based on your skills what makes you stand out from the rest companies not just look for a degree they look more than that in you like your skills uh your certification internship project training and there are very few institutions which prepare you on these things that's why i researched and found sunstone sunstone is a leading higher education service provider that works with academic institutions in upscaling students for employability courses like bcamc mba btec etc are offered with sunstone edge through their 35 campuses in 30 cities and you can also do advanced certification in the most in demand skills like blockchain artificial intelligence machine learning data science big data data analytics and many more they also provide 50 plus guaranteed interviews to each of their student with the recruiters like google amazon microsoft accenture icsci sbi etc that they have on board they also have zero post tmi option available with fast approval and zero loan processing fee together with a scholarship of worth rupees one plus crore so if you are planning to pursue any course from the above mentioned courses then i have got an assured scholarship of world rupees 20 000 for you guys on all the courses but you can avail this scholarship only through my link the link i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out and this offer is for limited time only so now let's see what is google and why data type in c plus plus first we will see bool see it can take two values bool means boolean value either true or false true means the default integer value for this is one for false it's 0 right so how you can use this you can simply write like int or you can write boolean data type so simply write the data type the name of the variable suppose i am taking a is equal to true you can write now true means by default implicitly it would be converted into end so it means one now b will contain one so if you print c out a this a will print one right if you write here false it means it will take 0 so it will print 0. fine so we generally use this data type in conditional statements if you want to check like two variables are there right we have suppose in x is equal to 10 and y is equal to 12 right and something like if you want to check if x greater than y is equal to is equal to true you can simply write true rather than writing one or zero right see yeah you can write one over zero also one means also true zero means false but rather than writing one and zero if you write true and false it would be i guess increase the readability right simply if we rather than one if we read true means it is more readable more understandable for us right means true or false so we can use directly trigger poles here right now see until c99 was in how we were using this bool using enum data type like this enum and here you can write down bool the name of your data type and here you can write down like false preview the list and semicolon then by default enum would associate this force with zero and this true with one now in your program you can write down false or true right because you have defined your own data type you using enum this is enumerated data type that we have discussed when you were discussing c language the link i'll put in this i button you can check out that video right but now in c99 they have introduced this bool and in c plus plus also we have this data type bool data type right so you can directly use this bool data type and we can use this in expression also suppose you are writing int and in x and y right and here i am writing in z and z is equal to x plus y plus true minus false this is also correct x means 10 y means 12 true means 1 false means it would be implicitly converted into 0 right so it means 10 plus 12 plus 1 minus 0 that is also fine in expression also you can directly write down true and false in conditional statement you can write down true or false right or if you want to rather than this like i am writing bool k is equal to 2n it means what it is also true means if this other than 0 anything any integer you will write that means true so it returns true if you write here 0 it means it is false right that is also fine so this is how ah this is what all about bool data type right there is not much more about this data type now next is voided type see and see the size of bool is one byte but sometimes you know it is also you can say implementation dependent implementation defined so sometimes in some compiler you can get other results then this one right but in my compiler on my machine it is taking one byte only so generally we say that that you know the size of this bool is one byte how you can find out in c out you can simply write like size of bool that's it it will give you the byte number byte one byte fine so this is all about bool data type now next is void data type see void means simply if i say then nothing generally we write this void use this word data type as a return type of function means if a function is not returning anything then we write something like this void suppose a function is add and it will we have something and it is not returning anything we don't have this return statement in this function we don't have this one means it is not returning anything so that's why we write down here void means nothing right second use of this void type is what if the function is not accepting any argument so we simply write here void it means it will not accept any argument so we write here the parameter list argument list is void third thing we can create a void pointer like void asterisk ptr means it is a generic pointer universal pointer you can typecast it according to your requirement see if i write int asterisk ptr it means this pointer would be containing address of a variable whose data type is integer this is a pointer to int if i write here float asterisk ptr means this pointer will contain address of a variable whose data type is float this is float pointer right but this is void so we do don't know the data type of the variable like which variable address we want to store in this pointer we don't know the data type of that variable is inter float or character or we don't know so according to our requirement if you i want to store address of a int variable i can typecast this pointer into in pointer if i want to store address of a float variable i can typecast it into float right on this word control so i have already uploaded a video the link of that video so you will find the side button you can check out that video right so this is generic pointer universal pointer you can type cast it according to your requirement right these three main uses of this void data type is there but we cannot use like see i am writing in x is equal to 10 void strict ptr and in ptr is equal to address of x right in ptr i am assigning address of this x means this is x is integer type and if you want to dereference this point like how to do dereference this asterisk ptr and suppose e and dl it will give error because this this is not void pointer right and we are storing address over int data type into variable so first you have to type cast it you cannot dereference a void pointer right word means nothing means no memory would be allocated so when you are going to dereference it doesn't have any idea how many bytes still how many bytes it has to access the value right how many bytes the size of the time one only one byte value or the value is in four bytes so the value is in eight bytes it doesn't know so you have to specify so first type cast it how to type cast it you just have to write down like s trick how to type cast int asterisk and ptr now we have type casted it into end pointer now it means now pointer no like four bytes so it has to dereference the value of till four bytes starting address then the like starting address is thousand and thousand and one then thousand into till thousand and three till four bytes it has to access right so this is how you can type cast this word pointer if you want to store address of a float variable you just have to type cast into float so these are three main uses of this void type but we cannot declare something like this void and name of the variable a this would be incorrect because word is nothing no memory would be allocated to void so you cannot declare a variable of word airtime right this is incorrect how you can use this void type in three ways return type of a function word rather than if you don't want to pass any argument then you can write down void and you can declare a word pointer right but you cannot declare a variable of word data type right so i think this is all about bool and void data type let me just show you with the help of a program okay so we have this file bool underscore dt dot cpp right so now first of all we will take bull data type bool and we are taking b is equal to suppose i am taking true and simply we are printing c out b right that's it let me just run this and this if this will print one automatically it would be converted into interior type so the integer value and true is one right so if you write here false then it will give you 0 right in expression also you can write down these thing like suppose i am right i am taking i am not taking this boo whole data type we are taking int x is equal to 10 comma y suppose not next i am taking float y is equal to 12.5 and next i am taking float z equal to true plus x plus false plus y and we are just printing c out z one more thing we are printing c out uh size of bool right so now let me just run this and show you see 23.5 means 10 plus 12.5 22.5 one true but false is zero so in expression also you can use this in conditional statement you can use like if else statement right there also you can directly write down this one if suppose you are writing if and i'm writing here x less than y is equal to is equal to true simply c out and x is lesser right x less than y we are printing right and in else part c out y is lesser that's it right now in this let me just run this and show you see first of all the value and the size then x is lesser because x is 10 and y is 12.5 so x is less than it is printing it is true right now next thing is what so this is all about bool about void c if you want to declare a variable of type void void and x sub void suppose i am taking v it will show error see incomplete type is not allowed because void is considered as incomplete type you cannot do these kind of things in three ways you can use this yeah if you declare it as a pointer like this that is fine i am taking pointer name ptr semicolon right that is fine and suppose let me just uh comment out these things and we will just see what ptr equal to address of x right and in c out we are dereferencing it this is strict ptr end see it is showing red line means it if you run this it will give error word is not a pointer to object type you are dereferencing word pointer that is not allowed so you have to type cast it how to type cast int star because x is of into type now it will print 10. it is printing now 10. so you have to typecast it is generic pointer so same written type of function you can use as void or parameter list if there is nothing you can write down word there but you cannot write down you cannot declare a variable of y data type right so i think this is all about void and rule data type in c plus plus and see if you write something like this if i'm writing bool and i'm writing suppose p array type name i'm taking p is equal to 45 and now i am printing this p just c out p see what it will give you 1 in at the place of it is printing 1 because it is considering this 45 as true value other than 0 every value is true value right only zero is false so forty five is also if you print this it will print one that is true so i think that's it about boolean word data in c plus plus so i think we have covered all the points about void and wool data type if there is something missing you can i don't know write down that point in common comment section or if you have any doubt you can ask me in comment section right so in the from the next video most probably we are going to start control structure in c plus plus so i'll see you next video till then bye take care
