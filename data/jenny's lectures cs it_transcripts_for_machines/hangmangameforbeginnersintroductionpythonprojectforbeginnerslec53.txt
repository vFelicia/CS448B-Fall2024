so in the series of planning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen what is indentation in Python why this is so important in Python right so now on this video we'll be working on a project Hangman game it's uh you can say mini project for beginners right we are going to create a game hangman theme I hope you have heard about this game or you have played this game you know the rules and all if you don't know it's okay in this video I'll give you just you know a brief intro about this game and with the help of example I'll show you what kind of output should be there how to play this game right so basically this game is a guessing game for two players or more than two players suppose I am having like two player first and second first player and second player so first player will guess a word any word can be there fruits food any vegetable name you know animal Name birds name any name can be there right suppose I have a guest apple right I'll not tell the second player I have guessed Apple fine so like whenever you you will run this so I have guessed like apple so one two three four five one two three four five letters are there only these five blank spaces are shown to the second player not this word right so now second player have to guess this word by suggesting the letters right but within a limited number of gases it's not like that just there are unlimited number of gases and unlimited attempts you will get no there are limited attempts right hangman basically it's like we have a hangman this this is the head the body of the that figure then two hands and legs so basically we have like we consider that we have six lives one two three four five six right within six attempts you have to guess the correct word suppose my guess is second player have guessed X so this is this is not present here this letter means you have guessed wrong letter and you will lose a life loser life means I'll be the first player will be starting to draw the hangman figure so I'll draw first of all the head right suppose second guess is a now a is correct a is in this word so at correct position I'll place this letter A right so now you will not lose a life suppose in third guess you have guessed why why is not present means your guest wrong letter so you are going to lose a life and let's draw one more part of the hangman figure that is the body of this hangman right now next guess is suppose Z this is also not correct so I'll draw one hand next guess is suppose M this is also not present so I'll draw second hand the first player will draw second hand now you are having only two lives one for this leg one for this leg once the figure is complete means this would be hand or die a means you will you are going to lose suppose next guess is e so I'll place this e here next is p so I'll Place p and B here only one is remaining next case is suppose B that is not correct one leg next guess is C it is also not correct second game over means you lose because the hangman figure is complete means it's hanged means you let a kind person die right or maybe you're still having one life and your guest correct l l means you are going to win the this letter is complete the word is complete means game over so two conditions for game over if the word is complete there is no Blank Space here in the word then game over you are going to win the message would be displayed you are going to win second game second condition to you know for for this uh for game over is what you are out of your lives right you have consumed all your attempt six attempts right means that's it game or you are going to at this point of time message would be printed you are going to you lose so this is what a Hangman game right I hope you got this now how to play this game right let me just show you the output how you know output should look like right okay so this kind of output would be there if you whenever you will run this project like maybe first line let's play Hangman and we have only six lives so it will show you you have only six lives to try to guess the word within six attempts good luck right now it has already guessed a word we don't know what is what the word is but the word is having one two three four five five letters and it will show only blank spaces so guess a letter suppose I am guessing X so X is not there so it will show you guessed X that is not present in the word so you lose a life loser life means now see the head head this of that hangman figure would be added to this figure right now again yes a letter suppose a okay a is present so at the position at first it will put a here now I guess you have guessed this letter so now it will again Ask guess a letter so I'm suppose B c b is not present so it will again draw the body of the handmade right you U is also not present it will show one hand of the hangman will be drawn next is let's say something like this oh that is also not present m not present so we are remaining only with one life only because One lag is remaining if this leg is complete hangman field is complete and you are going to lose so if I can guess the letter is p so p is present p and p okay I know what is this n okay l and then e d e so it's Apple you win means you have guessed this letter before the segment figure is complete right so now you you are going to win right if if I run this again see it is next suppose X this is not present l not present G not present e not present U right so we are left with only one life so let me just guess D not present so hangman figure is complete and you lose right so now you have the idea what is Hangman game and how to play this the rules and all right now the second part of this this thing is what this project is what you have to create a flowchart first because we have a complex problem how to no uh the wireless complex problem into smaller tasks smaller ones so just draw flowchart you can write down algorithm and draw flowchart to better and you know understand this problem try to draw flowchart first then write start writing program right so in the next video we will be drawing the flowchart so now we see the next little demo bye take care
