so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed one coding exercise in the last video programming to find out like average height from the list of heights right so we'll be seeing one more exercise in this video this is the you know this is a similar type of exercise that we have discussed in the last video so I recommend to watch out that video first then definitely without you know looking at the solution of this video you can easily solve this problem you can you can easily write down this problem sorry this program now what is this program you have to write down a program to find out maximum number from a list of numbers no that's very simple I hope you know the logic to find our maximum number from store from array something like this you must have I think you must have done this thing in another in another language right so I guess you know the logic to find out maximum number right logic is same only the syntax is different how to write down full loop how to write down if statement but that is you know after I run for Loop and if statement so that is all you need to know for solving this problem okay anyway let me just give you some hint also first note down some points first thing you will take input using input function from the user right second thing what you need to do you cannot use max inbuilt function is there there is inbuilt function mix and whenever you pass list here it will automatically give you the maximum but no you cannot use this inbuilt function you have to replicate its functionality using for Loop okay now some hint is here also you can use that split you need to use split function and no need to use I think no you will have to use range function also right so split and range so these two functions we have seen in the last video also how to use these functions and what is the functionality of these functions it will split basically your strength into a list and separate out each element into that list right and put those element into that let's separate out each element from the string it depends what uses to you know you are using a separator as a space or a comma whatever you want to use you can use range is what it simply produce or generate a series of numbers by default it will start from zero and ending point you have to give suppose you are going to Range Five so it will be one two three four five five numbers not till five five numbers from zero to start by default but if you want to start from anywhere else you can specify start point and end point that's it right so I guess now that is all you need to know to solve this problem right so now you can pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this exercise if not it's okay we'll see the solution right now we'll creating a new file and I'm going to name this coding exercise 15 DOT py with 15 right so first of all what we will do obviously we'll take input from the users so suppose I'm taking numbers is equal to using input function okay now we have list of numbers suppose we have list of numbers something like this 34 45 12 minus 89 67 something like this right so this is now using input function we have taken so this is a string you have to split this out convert into a list and each this 34 45 this should be element of list so using split function we can do this like numbers dot split because in numbers we have this these all numbers so numbers don't split and what is the separator here simple space so will not pass anything as argument right okay so this the name of the list I am giving numbers underscore list okay I'll be storing the list now I have a list of numbers this but the problem is still every element is what a string and we want obviously integer right if you want to check out you can print this numbers list and I'll show you the output let me run run this for you and I'll be entering the number or something like this okay now let's run this see it will give you it has converted this into list separate separate items but these items are still a string but you won't we want integer so you have to convert each and every item into integer right so obviously we will have to access the less suppose this is our list so you have to Traverse this list from zero from 34 to 60 70 from starting to end and how we can access element of list using index index would be started from 0 0 1 2 3 4 5. so if we need range of you know you can say a sequence of numbers from 0 to whatever element it is on okay so that we can do first of all obviously you have to find out length so you how you can find you will find out the list because to Traverse these element you have to put suppose I am traversing these elements so for any variable name from like I in numbers list if you write down this thing like this I am taking numbers list and X is 34 45 12 but how to access maybe you are thinking directly we can write what numbers list and in bracket we will lie down I because in I first of all we have 34 then 45 then 12 right yeah you are right but let's see what happens and convert it into lick and what it is so we'll access numbers list I convert into int and then again we'll assign to the same list right okay let's run this and after that we will suppose you want to print the list after converting so this printing would be definitely from out of the store Loop only one line is indented so let's run this and see what output you will get 134 and something like oh sorry enter here see you will get an error type error list indices must be integer or slice note integer in line number six in line number six list indices this index should be integer not string because this I in first at first in I we have 34 and 34 is still a string so this index cannot be a string it should be integer and that is what exactly you want to convert each and every element into integer so we cannot do this thing what we can do we can simply like rather than obviously numbers less we will not I don't want 34 I want 0 to tell the length of the list minus 1. so we have a range function you can use the range function from 0 to have to find out length of this using for Loop we can find out right so first obviously we cannot use length function okay so we'll not using length function if you can use length function so simply you can write down Len and numbers test it will give the length of this so here it will give one two three four five six six zero to six so it will print 0 to it will generate the numbers 0 to like 0 1 2 3 4 5. if suppose we are taking example of this list so it will generate till 6 element length is 6 so till length minus 1 till 5. and that's exactly you want at first time in I we will be having because at the time of at the place of this range is 0 to this now we have this thing so first ni 0 would be assigned so in numbers list 0 and 0th index we have 34 so 34 will be converted into int and then again 34 will be assigned to here I is now first time zero in the same list so 34 is now integer not string right if you don't want to use length function using for Loop also we can find out the length how we can find out let's see let's take a variable count any variable you can take right and with for Loop suppose I am taking a variable any variable you can take I also same variable in all the loops right or different also it's up to you so here I am suppose same variable I am taking suppose I or let's take a other variable name any meaningful like number in numbers list right so for each number I'll be increasing the count count plus equal to 1 or count is equal to count plus one right here one now simply let's print here the length of the list okay let's uh just use here F string so we'll be writing like count I hope you know just you remember still the syntax of F string and Y F string is to be used if not you can check out the playlist we have discussed this thing so the length of the list is this and rather than here using length function we can simply write down count or no need to specify 0 because by default range will print number from 0 to whatever you will give here count minus one right okay let's run this okay one twenty three any number I am taking like here these numbers see now the length of the list is six one two three four five six and now see the list is because we have printed the list but these are entities are not string because they are not into these chords single quote or double quote okay now that's fine we are now having a list of integer now you can easily write down the syntax of the logic of finding maximum number right okay rather than printing the number list here let's remove this and okay how to find out maximum let us suppose we have a variable do not take Max because Max is what C Max is what a function here inbuilt function so maximum suppose maximum underscore number equal to either you can take 0 here or you can take suppose I am whatever list I will be taking suppose this example so I am assuming the first number from the list is maximum number so I'm assuming from this list numbers list first zeroth index whatever is at zeroth index that is maximum number now I'll compare this with every element right so and if any element is greater than this this 34 then we will set that number maximum number so how you can do you have to Traverse for that the complete list whatever saying we have Olu so for any variable you can take like suppose number again I am taking phone number in numbers list right now you have to check if if this number is greater than whatever maximum number we have set at starting greater than this maximum number then if this is the case then we will do maximum number is equal to number that's it and at last after ah you know out of this for Loop will simply print maximum number using a string will printing right so in which we have maximum number which variable the variable is maximum number I hope this is not confusing this is very simple the logic of finding this this logic finding maximum number at first it because still here I got I think you have got everything have to convert this one now see maximum number is a variable and numbers list so in maximum number now we have in maximum number now we have 34. right now numbers list here numbers listed suppose this complete list I am taking this example right so numbers list will be this will be replaced by this list so at first in number we have 34. so let's check 34 in number list yes this is 2 so enter here if number number is now 34 34 greater than maximum number in maximum number in maximum number we have 34. no not greater than because these are equal right so will not enter here check for next iteration now 45 would be assigned to this number right now 45 in numbers list yes it is there so true you will enter here at this point of time in number we have at this point of time we have the number we have 45 so 45 greater than and in maximum number in maximum number this variable we still have 34. 34 is this condition true yes this condition is true so enter in this if block statement and now maximum number becomes number because whatever number whatever is on the right hand side in this uh this assignment operator that would be assigned to left hand side variable so in number at this point of time we have 45 so 45 could be assigned in maximum number so maximum number now becomes 45 right so this is how it will be treated now for third thing 12 because we haven't released till the last element of the list as well 12. so 12 you will be assigned to this number 12 greater than now at this time we have here 12 12 greater than now maximum number is 45 because in this variable we have now 45 so greater than 45 is this condition true no okay skip this this statement enter here minus 8 now in number we have minus 8 minus 8 in this number list yes minus 8 greater than maximum number no skip this then 89 in number 89 like this it would be treated right so finally from this list 89 would be printed okay so let's run this for this same example okay enter list of numbers the length of the list is 6 and the maximum number is 89. I hope you got this this was very simple so the main idea was just to get you familiar with for Loop rather than using the inbuilt functions right how to use a split how to use like this range obviously in the range we will be discussing in next video in detail this is just basic so I guess you have done this exercise successfully because the similar type of thing we have done in previous exercise also right so if you have watched my previous video then it's very easy for you okay now the next video we'll see about range function in detail right so now once in the next video till never bye take care
