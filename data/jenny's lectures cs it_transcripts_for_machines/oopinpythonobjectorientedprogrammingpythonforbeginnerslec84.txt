hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning path and programming language in the previous video we have seen one project that was a coffee machine project I hope you got that thing and you have done that right now from this video onwards we are going to start a very important Concept in Python that is object oriented programming right so we will be discussing everything about object oriented programming all the concepts and all in further videos but this video is about what this video is basically about why we need objectoriented programming till now also we have done few projects and we have written many programs without the need of object oriented programming yes then why now why we need oop right until now we were we were following which approach right so basically in this video I'll try to answer this question why do you need object learning programming and then further we'll discuss what is an object and then what is object on your programming right and later videos we'll be discussing all the concept classes objects and inheritance polymer facial obstruction everything about oop right so now before that I just want to tell you something it is important specially for those who are preparing for gate and ESC for gate and escs parents right it's like a never before opportunity for you guys an academy is back with combat yes and this time it is ultra combat so now you have a chance to get up to 90 scholarship and many rewards such as MacBook Dell laptops Samsung phones and many more would be conducted on 23rd of July and the time is 11 am how many question you will get 40 question mcqs would be there in this test and the time limit is 120 Minutes you will get to solve the questions now what are the syllabus syllabus will be General aptitude engineering mathematics and Technical and the most important thing is you can enroll for this test for this combat for free you don't need to pay anything no registration fee nothing right so do not miss this opportunity and enroll today the link I'll put in the description box of this video and you can use my code jkl10 to enroll for free in this combat right so all the relevant information and Link you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out okay now let's try to find out the answer of this question why basically we need OB first see in the previous video we have done this project the coffee machine project so this was our project the menu resources profit uh is a variable that is global resources also dictionary having information that is global and we have defined many functions right and these functions are calling like here we are calling these functions and these are returning something and they are interlinked right see in this function we are in make coffee in this function we are updating the resource item resource item means these item because these are Global right and this function also we are accessing the resources because we are just comparing here we are not updating anything and in this like we are we are we are updating this profit This Global variable profit we are updating this right so these functions are interlinked with each other having many relationship right okay now this approach is what here we are following the processor oriented programming this approach pop approach right processor means these functions are known as procedure means procedure basically means the steps how we are going to perform some tasks right and how we are going to perform this function the check resources these are obviously the statements or the tasks we are writing the steps we are writing so these are what procedures so we can say function so this is what pop approach right now yeah that is fine we are following pop approach so why now we need oop approach because this is also fine right but in pop approach we can handle only small project because see it is just a simple one coffee machine project and here see we are having multiple functions and the main important thing is these functions are updating Global variables the profit is global variable a resources this dictionary is also Global obviously so in many functions more than one function we are accessing this resource and one function is updating this resources and in one function we are updating this profit right so we are updating the global variable or the data so suppose we are dealing with a large project a large scale project there we are having multiple functions 50 functions or 100 functions and many Global variables right so it would be very difficult for you guys to track like which function is accessing which global variable which function is you know updating which global variable and accidentally if we update a global variable global data in any function then maybe it will give us some error or some unusual you know result right some unexpected output right so main thing is I think now you have noticed main thing we are focusing in in this approach pop approach on functions how to do the task the functions the procedures not on data data is now data here is freely moving during the whole program because obviously the global data is moving freely any function can access this data any function can update this data right it means there is no data security data is freely moving we are just focusing on the procedures of the functional means you can say how to do the task on this we are focusing more so one drawback of this is what data security I hope you got it why I am saying that it there is no data security in pop approach I hope you got this thing now right with the help of this example so now if you want to handle any real world problem any large project right then definitely it would be not easy to manage that project to implement that project with the help of this pop approach right because of the complexity and the relationship between those functions and all how to manage the relationship how to check which function is how to track which function is using which global data and which function is updating which data and all right because we are not focusing on data more and if suppose if maybe you think like we can do we will take like no global data is there we just change this type of this global data just take local data so all the functions which are accessing that global data you have to do accordingly the changes in those functions as well you have to resolve those functions as well right because maybe many functions are using that global data right so because of the complexity and the number of relationship are very complex here it would be very difficult to manage that thing with the help of this pop approach right and obviously the data security is not there and yeah obviously if you are implementing any real world project then we know that the data is how much the data is important like maybe I want like anybody can access my name jayanti but only few person can access my mobile number not all the person obviously I want my data safe so if you want to implement if you want to model any real world problem real world project then definitely you have to focus on data security and data security is not in pop you cannot you like you cannot Implement data security you cannot achieve data security in pop approach that is why we need another approach and that is in oop yes we are having data security and why that I'll tell you how you can Implement data security in objectoriented programming and there are other drawbacks also in this approach pop approach like there is no inheritance no virtual function no operator overloading no polymorphism no data hiding many other things are there but now I know you don't know about what is inheritance what is data hiding what is virtual function what is polymorphism so that is why it will not be you know it would not be easy for you to understand these things right but I'm sure data security is one thing one drawback that you got exactly what is data security and why I am saying this right same thing in later videos we will discuss what is inheritance what is like you can say that virtual function and all will be discussing polymorphism data obstruction data hiding then you will get why I am saying right now like pop is not having these things right it's okay if you're not getting anything of these terms it's okay it's normal right because its first lecture of oop and definitely it would not be easy for you to understand everything in one video right but till now I hope the data security you got right now objectoriented programming is used to model now the real world projects right now first thing we'll see like what is object we know python is objectoriented programming and I think you have heard this line also everything is considered as an object in Python right why I am saying this let's see with the help of this example see if I take a variable like a is equal to 1 and if you print the type of uh this variable a then what you will get just focus on the answer see class int class because here we are having a class that is predefined in the library of python class is int and this a is what it's just an object of this class int if I'll not take this a if I like want to find out the type of this string hello now let's run this C Class Str now this hello is an object of class Str so this is built in class in Python that is why I am saying everything you deal now this hello is what an object they say is also an object everything you deal is in Python is what an object let's take if I have a function display and there I am just using the pass statement nothing I'm going to write and then I want to find out this type of this display function this you need to write down name of this function display let's run this and see class function so there is a class in build class function and this function is an just an object of this class this class that is why I was I was saying like everything in Python whether it's variable function or any string or not everything is considered as object now you got why we are saying like what is an object and why we are saying this so you got this idea in built classes we are having python many inbuilt classes right and the object you can use fine and see there is a class Str see you know this hello is what just it's a string if you want to find out type so the class will be string so if I use something like hello don't so the class Str that is having many functions lower title index and many function see right so these functions you can use on this object because this object is of Str class type right so if I use this function only lower and if I print if I run this C this is already in lower so it would be let's suppose I'll do this in capital letter and C it will print in small letter capital letter but don't lower means small letter so there are many inbuilt function also that you can call on that object with the help of dot operator right whatever the object dot whatever the function is there of that class so many classes and those classes are having inbuilt functions those you can use on those object right so I guess you have some idea now objects and all right now uh oriented oriented means in simple English language if we say then like it's interested in a particular thing or a particular person so we are basically interested in object that is why it is known as object oriented programming so are interested or main focus is in on objects right that is why it is known as oop like you know this shop is male oriented or female oriented means in this show of the product all the product you will get are of males not females male oriented female oriented like this so object oriented you focus on we are interested in objects that is why it is known as objectoriented programming right so I hope the answer of why why we need oop that is somewhat clear to you guys because we have done some advantage of oop not all because everything will be discussing later videos then you will get all the advantages and benefits of Pop if you you know understand to a certain level what is op and what are the advantages then definitely you will get why it is always better to use op and why in the industry uh you know in the companies they use this op approach to you know Implement project large project real world project right now let's take a simple example if a real world problem I'm taking if I am going to start a YouTube channel right so in starting I'm the only one like one man army so I can teach some subjects I am the editor I am thumbnail designer I am the social media marketer I am the instructor right but I want to start many courses C C plus plus Java computer network dbms operating system data structure web development course and many more courses then definitely if I am a oneman Army then it would be very difficult for me to manage everything right so this would become more complex if you want to grow your YouTube channel obviously you got it right for one person fine now what I can do to solve my problem I can hire like if I'm going to start uh another course and that is web development so I can hire one instructor that will teach this course right and maybe one editor that will do the editing as well as thumbnail thumbnail designing one I will hire social media marketer and I would be like manager right now my task is to manage these things now this manager like suppose the manager is me so I don't need to go in so much detail of how they are going to do their task I don't need to tell how to teach to the instructor how do you need to tell how to edit the videos how to design thumbnail to an editor I don't need to tell a social media marketer how to do your job right I don't need to worry about these things because these are expert in their job they know how to do their job better than me I guess right so this is going to simplify my task and simplify the relationship so the same approach or the same concept we can use to simplify our code to implement larger project to make a project more scalable the same approach right and see now one more thing if I want to like start one more course about Java so or before that let me just tell you something now let's take one thing like I'm taking this instructor so this instructor is having and see as we know objectoriented programming oop is used to model real world project right so let's create now a virtual YouTube channel so let's create a virtual instructor virtual editor virtual social media marketer and everything virtually let's create right now we need to model this these things in structure editor and all in programming right we need to model this thing in programming and obviously using oop approach we use we model right now this instructor this is Hamming some information right and it will do some task right so two thing what he or she has or what he or she does so it is Hamming obviously some information like name of the instructor maybe address phone number and like some attribute like has books then we can say like true having books has camera because to record the lecture we need camera and like has laptop that is also true or maybe something is false so it is having something some information right and it will do something what it will do teach so we can say like deaf teach we can define a function and here you can write down some statements and maybe other thing other function we can do like depth it will also prepare quiz so that is other thing so this is what it is having this is what it will do right now in programming terms see these are simply we know these are variables if simply I say because these are variables obviously and these are functions but in case of object oriented programming we call the variables as attributes and these are known as methods not functions methods and there is some reason because see these variables and these functions are not free floating in pop the variables we take like global data that was free floating move anywhere these variables these functions are associated with and entity that is instructor so these things are associated with this thing right that is why these are known as not simple variables attributes not simple functions methods right because they are these are associated with something these are not free floating in your programs right so in op we try to model real world object so and these objects are having something some information these objects do something so what they have that thing is modeled with the help of attributes and what they do that thing is model with the help of methods right so simply we can say an object is just a way of combining some piece of data and some functionality into a same thing into same thing like into a box this is same thing in a box only we are having this and this as well right now if I want to start another course like Java so I can hire one more instructor if I want to start another course I can hire one more instructor that is fine right so instructor suppose I have higher like Gia one more instructor payal maybe one more instructor so now see now these actual thing these actual person these are known as objects in objectoriented programming these are objects right and this this instructor this is simply a blueprint or a design this is known as class so class is simply a blueprint just to create objects so these actual things these are objects right like if you are going to build a house then the map or the sketch of that house is what a blueprint a design you have and using that design you can build a house so that house is object and that sketch or that map is what a class and see using that single map we can we can construct we can design multiple houses right so we have only one class we have only one design we have only one blueprint using that we can build many we can create we can generate many objects right so I hope you now you got the basic idea or an overview what is a class what is an object right and why basically we need object oriented programming right so now the overview of objectoriented programming like basically why we need this right and what is objectoriented programming what is simply an audio of class and object and this thing is clear to you guys right now in the next video we will see in more detail what is the class what is an object how to create a class how to create an object the syntax and everything right with the help of program right so now it's in the next two till then bye like it
