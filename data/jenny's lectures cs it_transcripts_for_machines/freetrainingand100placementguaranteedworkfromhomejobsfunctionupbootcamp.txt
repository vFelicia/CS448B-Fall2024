based companies and this is not only for cs and it students anybody from any educational background can be benefited from this video definitely this is for you you have just done your 12th you have a laptop and you have internet connection that's it you are at right place whatever i am going to tell you in this video definitely for each and every student it would be beneficial for you guys see if you are doing any graduation course or anything you are doing then definitely every student everyone wants a good job for every cs and iit student the dream is what to get placed in product based companies right and maybe you have done your graduation and you are still trying you are not getting you haven't you know uh still get a job and you are still trying maybe you are thinking that there are less job opportunities or no job opening right now but it's not like that industry has a huge demand of good tech talent see industry is having huge demand you have done your organization means you have the degree but still you are not getting a job so the gap is you don't have that type of knowledge yeah that is the harsh reality nowadays the college today you know they don't provide that type of knowledge that type of industry level knowledge that is required for the industry for that role no no yeah generally in colleges they focus more on theory not on practical part and this type of this type of thing happens right yeah that is the harsh reality and i'm telling you this thing from my personal experience right so now what's the solution obviously together to get a good job now student do what selflearning extra courses right they learn new skills they go to coaching institute and everything and for those coaching institute also you need to pay for college also you need to pay you know double burden you are paying in college also you are paying for the same thing you are paying in coaching institute also and after that it's not guaranteed that you will get a job or not right or you will get a good job or not now what if i say that yeah there is someone who will train you right and you don't need to pay anything until you get your placement until your placement right and there is 100 guaranteed placement maybe you will say it's not true and it is not possible but yes it is possible the platform i'm going to tell you in this video on that platform platform you will get these type of features and the name of that platform is function up function up is a organization which provides training now maybe you will say if they provide training then definitely they'll charge for this training no they are not going to charge you until your placement until you get your job of minimum 5 lpa after getting a job of minimum 5 lpa then you need to pay something from your salary 17 of your salary for 36 months you need to pay but after getting the job and that's fine i guess plus one more plus point is what for female candidates there is 50 scholarship going on right now means suppose after getting your first salary you need to pay 100 rupees just for example then if you are a woman you need to pay only 50 rupees so 50 to 4 female candidates i think this is a great opportunity for you guys and if you are a student if you know if you want to get a job in software development then definitely this is for you guys this is a great great opportunity and i think no one wants to miss this thing now the question is who is going to train you now their your mentors will be professional they are experienced they are industry experts they are itself working in the in those top tech companies in those industries in product based companies so they have experience of everything they are going to train you on every parameter like for interview preparation also they are going to you know tell you some tips and some tricks also everything theory part also practical part also because you know they have the experience of that kind of environment that generally college teachers don't have right yeah that is true so the time limit of this you can say this boot camp would be four months and you can see week wise what they are going to teach you in every week you can see here right and you need to you need to dedicate at least nine hours for software development right in these nine hours your theory sessions your practical sessions your you know doubt solving sessions your interview preparation everything is going to be covered in these nine hours right every day you need to you need to dedicate nine hours and what they are going to teach you in these weeks you can see the detail here and the last batch of function i've got 100 placement the average package was 11 lpa and the highest package was 24 lpo 42 and iit graduates and second highest was 18.5 lp and yes 40 were placed in u.s and singapore based companies right and 80 percent the job offered which are work from home jobs so if you want to work from home job yes that is possible here that is a possibility and if you want to work you know work in abroad companies like us and singapore based companies that is also possible here so these are some positive sides of function and i'm really impressed with these points definitely i think you should definitely go for this platform once you once visit this and if you find it you know it's helpful for you guys you can go for it right i would not say negative point but one thing is what for this training there are limited seats right what is the admission process for you know for this training first thing is that you have to fill a registration phone the link of that form you will find in the description box of this video you can go to that link click that link fill the form they are going to ask you simple thing your contact detail your educational background that's it simple simple things just submit that phone right next thing is they are going to evaluate you based on your these details right and if you are selected their counselor one person from their team is going to call you and whatever doubt you have you can ask your doubts generally students have doubt about isa model that they follow income share agreement that i have told you right like until you got a placement you don't need to pay anything after getting your first salary you are going to share your income with with them right like 17 of your salary up to 36 months so that is what income share agreement so you can ask any doubt you have you can ask to their counselor they are going to you know ask you a few questions general questions right right they are going to evaluate you and once if you are accepted by their counselor then they are going to assign you a test yes after registration process if you go through this test then your chances of getting you know in the function of training is going to be higher is going to be you can say increased so better to go for this test they are going to ask you simple question in this test simple aptitude question and your simple knowledge they are going to check right questions are not of that high level and if you pass this test then your interview phase is going to be there by the your mentors they'll ask you simple simple question like they'll judge you like how passionate you are for this training you are you're really interested for this training you're really interested to get a job in those companies and all simple questions in these simple parameters on these simple parameters they are going to analyze you after interview if you pass that interview then yes you are in now you are accepted for the training part now you can go through that four month boot camp the training and everything and see it's not like that for four months only they are going to assist you no you will get lifetime aluminized support and networking opportunity here so see their admission process is also tough only the hard working candidates would be accepted for the training it's not like that everybody who is going to fill that registration form they are going to they'll accept you and they'll provide you training no first they will analyze you they'll assess you you have to go through these steps and then after that they'll train you and one thing i like the most is there is no registration fee no training fee nothing you need to pay until you your placement until you get your job and after that you need to pay but that's fine so i think i have told you all the basics and important things about this function of boot camp and this platform if you have any doubt you can
