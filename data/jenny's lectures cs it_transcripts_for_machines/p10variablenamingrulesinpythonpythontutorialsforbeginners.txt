so in the series of learning python programming language in the previous video we have seen about variables what is variable why do we need variables how to create variables how to assign values how to use those variables in your program and all okay and we have seen one program also how to swap two numbers with the help of a third variable okay it's not like that we're using only third variable you can swap two number without using any other variable you can swap numbers but those program we can discuss later in some videos okay now there are some rules to name variables okay how to name a variable like we have taken a b c x y z or name age these kind of things no there should be some name of a variable so you have to follow some rules to name a variable okay so what are those rules first thing is what it is not a rule actually but you should take care of this thing the variable name should be meaningful see what i am saying is suppose uh let's take this example i'm asking from user what is your name okay whatever user will enter that name i'm going to store in a variable now the name of that variable should be meaningful what is your name so i'm asking your name so better to name take a meaningful name like name i'm taking although you can take a a is equal to what is your name so whatever name like jenny i'll provide so in a journey would be stored but that is not meaningful by looking at a if after some days if i look at this variable a by looking at this i cannot say which type of value is stored in the same and if i have taken name here then i can tell after a few days also whenever i look back at my code like this name is having name of someone so it should be meaningful if i ask like what is your age so better to take variable name age or you can take my age multiword variable you can also take but for that also we will see some rules okay it should be so like that what is your age and i'm taking name yeah it will not give any syntax error or nothing else you can take this variable name also but it is not meaningful like i'm asking age and i'm storing that variable in variable name name i think that's not meaningful okay so first thing it should be meaningful second thing is what now the actual rule comes in a variable name a variable name can have only alphanumeric characters like from capital a to z small a to z zero to nine numbers and underscore these things a variable name can have like for example we have h so it is having a two z numbers uh sorry a two z uh letters so if i uh say something like this like name one that is also fine if i am saying name 1 2 3 that is also fine if i say name underscore 1 that is also fine because underscore is also allowed ok so variable name consists of these things but no special symbol is allowed no special symbol other than this underscore is allowed if i write something like this name space one space is also not allowed you have to you know keep taking notes of this thing space is not allowed if i write hash this is also not allowed if i write something like this like age question mark the special symbol is also not allowed any special symbol is not allowed rather than this underscore okay now next rule is what a variable name must start either with a letter or underscore if i write something like this one underscore age this is invalid because it is starting from a digit so variable name cannot start with the visit yeah this is fine age underscore 1 this is fine it is starting with letter or underscore age this is also fine so variable name can start with must start with either a letter either small or capital or underscore okay it cannot start with the desert now let me give you some example of multiword name if i'm taking my age multiword name you can also take okay like my variable name my age like this thing so if i write multi uh word name then there are some rules also like some cases or technique also you can use first is camel case in camel case or in this technique what we do each word like i have this name my name so i'm having here two words one is my one is name so every word other than the first word will start with capital letter see first is with small then capital if i take like my variable name so i'm having three words my variable name three words are there so first word is having small letter next word is starting with capital letter next word is starting with capital letter so this technique is chemicals next is pascal case in this case every word is having every word with start with a capital letter like my variable name or my name each word will start with capital letter third is one is like snake case in this case each word would be separated with the underscore like my underscore variable underscore name three words are there each word is separated with the underscore so i generally prefer in this case to use multi you know multi word variable so i'm just giving you some example you have to tell me this is assignment for you guys like these variable names are valid or invalid see so these are some variable name like roll number having a space then id then s1 underscore name then no number with underscore then age with the double quotation mark you have to tell like these are valid or not and some more rules are one more rule is what uh there are some reserved word and python so you cannot use those reserved word as a variable name like in c and c plus also we have some keywords or reserved words those cannot be used as variable name like class in this case for example we have class is a reserved word so this cannot be used as a variable name okay so you can check out the reserved words those we cannot use as variable name fine python is case sensitive actually okay so in this case like if i'm writing this raw number and if i'm writing this role number these two are considered as different names because here r is capital here as small so python is case sensitive language so these variable name are also you can say case sensitive fine so you have to tell these are valid or not one more thing we have discussed how to assign values or how to create variables so there are some ways which statement is valid which is valid and which is invalid you have to tell in comment section one statement is where a is equal to 1 i'm assigning a value 1 to the c then 1 is equal to a this assignment or where underscore a is equal to 1 which one is valid which one is invalid you have to tell me in comment section okay so now i guess there are simple rules so variable i know how to name a variable that's it about for now it's about variables uh in the next video we'll see uh data types primitive data types in python so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
