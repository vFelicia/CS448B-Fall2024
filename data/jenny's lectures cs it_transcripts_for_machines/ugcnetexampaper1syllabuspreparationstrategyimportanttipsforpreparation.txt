so in this series of preparation of UGC net exam in the previous video we have already discussed how to prepare for a paper to write that was subject specific for computer science I have already list already discussed it now in this video we are going to discuss how to prepare for paper 1 so this paper 1 is general paper it is not subject oriented it would be same for every student who is going to sit in that exam right so first thing you need to take care is what many students think that it is very easy no need to study for that many students think that it is very tough we can't clear this thing we can we can't study for paper one how will I study so these two points are myths it is not too easy and it is not too difficult right because it is for every student so they the level is from easy to you can say intermediate some questions are easier I would rather say very easy some questions would be very easy some questions would be of intermediate level but it's not like that the questions would be of high level or you know very difficult fine but in my first attempt I have made this mistake that I thought this paper one is it would be very easy and I'm not going to prepare for this one I have just prepared for paper 2 and because of paper 1 only I haven't done well in this paper and I was not able to crack net examine my first attempt but in my second attempt yeah at that time I have devoted some time for paper 1 as well so I'm going to share my strategy also that how many days I have devoted for this preparation of paper 1 hole where I have studied and everything right so very first thing is obviously you should have flavors of this one just to download the syllabus you should have a hard copy of the syllabus of paper 1 there would be 10 units and from each unit they are going to ask five questions right so total 50 questions would be there and Marx would be hundred marks and all questions are compulsory right sometimes it happens that from one unit they ask three to four questions and from another unit they ask six six to seven questions sometimes it happens one on an average they are five questions from each unit so you should have the slippers it's not like that just watch the YouTube videos they have discussed the sabersense just you have just started preparing for that you have to do yourself some work you have to be self you know you have to be independent so please download the syllabus yourself analyze that slippers read that slippers which are the units right second thing is now obviously how we are going to analyze those you know units because some units are easy some units are difficult in which the theoretical sections are also there the practical sections are also there so you have to download for analyzing that you have to download previous l question paper at least for five years or maybe for ten years right but at least five year question previous education papers first download right and if you think that you are smart enough there is no need to study for paper one you can do what just in time or just set one R because for this yeah time would be sixty minutes you have to be only sixty minutes and two hours for paper to 3 R would be there and now it would be on computerbased the paper would be computerbased and there would be no gap between paper 1 and paper to write continuously for 3 hours there would be two papers but you have to make sure you have to be wood only one are for paper one and two are so paper 2 so set timer for 1 R take one paper previous L question paper and try to soul and see how many questions are correct right second paper also and see how many questions are correct at that time you will realize that where you are standing if you have to mean you need to prepare for paper one or not it's up to you only like maybe you are smart enough you are extraordinary students and without preparation you will get maybe 60 marks or 50plus marks in paper one that is also fine without preparation you are getting 50plus marks so likewise solve all the question paper all the pipe here question paper means tenth question paper would be there and see where you are standing if you are getting good marks like 50 60 marks then that is fine no need to prepare right and if you are getting less marks means obviously you will know now where your weak points and your strong points so now what you have to do from these 10 units when you will analyze when you solve the previous equation paper you will see that which type of questions are being asked from each units SI unit should be something like teaching aptitude research aptitude your communication your reading comprehension your ICT your you can say higher education and reasoning also maps reasoning logical reasoning and people and environment and government policies these 10 units would be there right so according to that you can decide which is easy for you and which unit is difficult for you for me easy units was actually teaching aptitude research aptitude and comprehension and ICT analogical reasoning you can see I was in teaching field so I was aware about something you know something about teaching research because I have been mtech so I have gone through the research process so I was also familiar with the research concepts comprehension is I think easy for everyone you are not supposed to prepare prepare for this one because we have practiced in your childhood many and seen messages one message will be there and questions will be there and from that message you have to read that message and you have to answer the questions right so I think at that time only you will you can answer the questions at least two questions would be very easy within the first two to three lines will get the answers maybe three questions would be a little bit tough you are not getting the answer but two questions would be very easy right but you don't have to devote much time at the time of you know attempting your having be able to manage the find how you should attempt the question paper that also will discuss in next video right and for me difficult was obviously be I was difficult data interpretation right maths was a little bit difficult match reasoning and higher education system people environment and government policies because see these are of you know higher education and people environment and government policies from these sections generally one or two question would be from you know general of a general awareness or current affairs regarding that right so obviously we are not much familiar with these kind of things the I in maths was also difficult and one is communication that is I can say it's difficult and I can't say it's easy but I put it in difficult section for me so according to you you how to decide in which section which sections are easy for you which are difficult for you plus in which section you are strong and in which section you are weak because you have to devote more time in preparing those units in which you are strong you have to focus on that thing just one more thing many students think that general awareness is also very important for this thing or current affairs and they devote much more time for current affairs and general awareness so there would be no such you know separate section for current affairs and general awareness from these sections only from these I guess they'll ask one or two questions that would be based on current affairs right so please do not devote much time to prepare for those things because in this case you have to know remember I think dates right and thus current affairs and general awareness this is very vast thing we can if we cannot set any boundaries and at that time only if you have read many many current appears in that case also it is not charities that you are going to solve and you can solve the questions in the exam I would rather say don't waste your time in preparing more and more in general right now see in this practical would be practical section would be your di your maths your reasoning and these all are what theoretical sections right so and I think teaching up into the saw substitude and these ICT from ICT they last simple you know computer related questions or many times simply they last the full form or even PDF at least two questions would be very easy so for computer science students it is a plus point because they know the terms they are familiar with the computer related terms IT terms maybe who those who are not from some little background maybe ICT would be in difficult section for those so according to you you have to decide which is easy which is difficult for you and in which section you are strong you have to devote much time on the strong sections and in paper please do not aim to solve all the 50 questions correctly right I'm saying correctly yes you have to attempt all the 50 questions because there would be no negative marking so at least try to solve all 30 questions correctly 30 to 35 if you will get 60 plus score that is considered as a good score and if you will get 70 plus that is considered as a great I think that would be helpful in clearing the jrf assurance but at least at least try to get 30 questions correctly means 60 marks in paper 1 and according to that you have to prepare your units it's not like that you have to prepare all the ten units thoroughly according to these questions means at least 6 or we can say 6 to 7 units from these out of 10 units you have to prepare thoroughly right you should do very good in 6 to 7 units maybe you are not very good three years that is fine now on another doubt of many students is that how many arts we should study for paper one or should we study paper one and paper to regularly for three to four months or should we study paper one in last for one month or fifteen days see it depends totally depends on you means every student is having its own you know his own plus points and weak points his own capabilities you I think you should better know your capabilities what I have done is in I were just having four and half months of repairing net examined in first two to two months and two and half months I just focused on paper one after that I used to prepare paper 1 and paper 2 as well as at the same time means daily one hour for paper one plus seven hours or eight hours for paper two and at last I devote 10 days for paper one so I think according to me you can decide it yourself I think 15 days are enough for preparation of paper one but you have to study regularly and sincerely in those 15 days if you are tired and you are frustrated only by reading your subject specific for subjects then you need to day one are you can do what you can solve the reasoning questions that is also fine or at last maybe you can devote 15 days regularly and sincerely for paper 1 so C it is it depends on you but please don't think that you need one month or two months for paper one preposition I think 15 days are in now from where you have to study paper 1c I have studied paper 1 from most of the subjects of most of the units from YouTube videos only there are many felons who are there who are you know providing lectures for preparation of paper 1 and these are very good right they also give you some videos on previous year question paper like so I was yes I was having study materials from a paid course also but I think seventy to eighty percent I was dependent on YouTube videos seventy percent I have prepared over from YouTube videos rather than my study material so I think that is in just solving the previous circulation papers and good material from YouTube some good YouTube videos that is fine for preparation of paper one I haven't record any books but yeah I have heard that on the net and I mean many videos that habeas Madonn which is good for paper one so if you want to go for any books and you can purchase that book because see I cannot provide you any review on that book because I haven't gone through that book but I think YouTube videos and so all the previous educational papers are enough to prepare for paper one and see these practical sections like di your reasoning and match these are you know timeconsuming sections and you need practice right and these are theoretical sections and they'll need less time to prepare and obviously in exam while you are attempting the questions they will need they'll need less time rather than solving these type of questions bi reasoning match especially these dia questions but at least c5 pressure would be there from this so at least two question would be there that would be one to progression would be there that would be very easy so you can solve those questions right but please at that time you are not you know you don't have to devote much time we don't have to waste much time to solve the equations maybe you think that you have prepared di well you have practice many questions so now in exam first of all I'll show di question and you have wasted much of your time in di a question because the 50 question would be there you will have 60 minutes right so almost one unit for each sorry one minute for each question because at last you how to devote five to seven minutes just to review your answers and just to see that how many questions are on attempting and you have to attempt those questions just to get by by guessing those questions those answers right how you should attempt that we will discuss in the next video that's it for this video now I'm going to see in the next video of tilde nobody take care
