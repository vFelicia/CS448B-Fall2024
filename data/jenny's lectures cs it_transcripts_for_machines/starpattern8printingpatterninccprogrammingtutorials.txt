in the series of learning programming in ca we are discussing printing pattern programs in c in this video i'll talk about how to print this pattern we'll see the logic here first of all in the whiteboard then i'll show you the output on my laptop using vs code editor right this is very simple to print don't just look at it and think it's very tough no let me clear out one thing it's very simple to print right how why i'm saying this see if you observe here then it is combination of two patterns which one this pattern is combination of one is this one this one right and one is this one inverted half parameter and one is this half pyramid combination of these two you combine this two will get this the only difference is what if we combine these two directly then two lines would be there having maximum number of stars here also five here also five right but here we have only one row having five stars having maximum number of stars right so you just have to change a little bit means combine the code of printing this pattern and this pattern and you have to change a little bit right because only one line we need having maximum number of stars fine now what change you do so first of all please watch out the videos that i have discussed printing this pyramid half pyramid and inverted half parameter i have discussed in detail because here i'll just simply write down the logic and we will discuss only the little change whatever you you need to do here right so please check out this video first i'll provide you the link of that playlist complete playlist see complete playlist in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let me just write down the code for this and this so now see this coding was to print this one the half pyramid right and from this to this this was to print this the inverted half parameter i have only changed a little bit here now i have initialized i is equal to number of rows minus 1 and i hope you got y i have done rows minus 1 because here i want only one line having maximum number of stars so we will completely print this pyramid and this pyramid the inverted half pyramid we will print only these four lines not the line having maximum number of uh that stars that is why i have done rows minus one if we take number of rows five means this loop would be executed only four times and that is exactly we want only four lines if number of rows are 9 then or you can say 10 then for this one we want 10 lines but from this inverted half pyramid we want only 9 lines we don't want the line having maximum number of stars right that is why ten minus one that is nine so this loop would be executed only nine times or uh if you have if you take five then four times only right now let me just run this one suppose number of rows you are entering before this you will write printf and number of rows using scanf you will take the value so number of rows i am taking five now pi is equal to one i would initialize with 1 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition 2 enter here j is equal to 1 now j 1 less than equal to i i is 1 yes condition 3 will enter here and star would be printed this one 1 star would be printed right now j plus plus j is 2 is 2 less than equal to 1 no condition not true exit from the loop slash n in the next line we are now right now i is equal to i plus plus i is 2 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition 2 again enter here and this would be step would be this step would be repeated right how many times till i value becomes 3 then 4 then 5 and 6 when i value becomes 6 then this condition is not real will exit from the loop means five times means five lines would be printed one two three four five till this we are done now we have to print this pattern now exit from the loop because condition not true now after this loop we have these lines means we have another four nu now i was would be initialized with number of rows minus one number of rows five five minus one that is four 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition true enter here j would be initialized with 1 1 less than equal to i is 4 yes condition 2 enter here and star would be printed right j plus plus j becomes 2 2 less than equal to four yes condition true again star would be printed now how many times star would be printed four times right when j value becomes five then we will exit from the loop means four star would be printed right that is why i have done rows minus one now i hope you got it all right now exit from the loop and slash n means we are into the next line now now i minus minus i becomes 3 yes 3 greater than equal to 1 again enter here and this loop the this process would be repeated until i value becomes 0 then 2 then 1 then 0 when i value becomes 0 stop it and how many times this 2 would be executed 1 2 3 4 means 4 lines would be printed like this and that's it exactly you want this pattern right so now i hope you got it how to print this pattern now maybe you are thinking in the previous video i have told you first analyze the pattern how many number of lines like five six then seven eight then nine then divide it into number of columns and the outer loop would be from one to nine means from one to nine number of rows should be nine but here number of rows are five and we are able to print nine number of rows right so yeah you have to think a little bit in a different way maybe some pattern is combination of other patterns also we have discussed simple simple patterns right like this and this in previous video also i have discussed a pattern that was also combination of two pattern full pyramid and inverted full parameter right so you have to think now a little bit in a different way in the complicated you know that patterns these are generally combination of simple simple two or three patterns right so just combine the coding of those simple patterns and that's it that is why i was saying these printing of these patterns are very simple i hope you got it now now let me show you the output on my laptop so now let me create another file pattern 11 dot c and here we have to declare i j one variable is space and one is two for total number of rows right and we will ask from the user enter number of rows using scanf obviously we are going to take the input and now for loop for the first pattern i is equal to 1 i less than equal to number of rows and i plus plus right now within this what j is equal to 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus and within this we will just print what star right and in the outer loop we have to print slashing now another that inverted half pyramid for that one also we have two we have to combine the coding right so one coding for this the half pyramid and this one is for inverted half gram so again i is equal to what rows minus 1 and i should be greater than equal to 1 here i minus minus right and within this another for loop j is equal to 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus and within this we are going to print star sorry not 8 its start and in the outer loop sorry note for loop we have to write down printf slashing right now that's it now let it should be number of its rows minus 1 right we are taking the variable name rows fine now let me just run this oh it's it should be printf where i have written this this is what printf sorry spelling mistake now again let me just run this now it is asking number of rows let's say 5 and you are getting this pattern exactly i want this pattern right now let me just run this for 10 number of rows 10. and this pattern you want right so if you don't want to change into this loop what you can do you can change you can just simply put rows till 1 and you can change into this for loop i till rows minus 1 that's it and now let me just run this for 5 number of rows and yeah exactly we are getting the same pattern right so now that's it for this video if you have any doubt you can ask me in comment box so now i'll see you in the next video with a new pattern till then bye bye take care
