so in the series of learning Python programming language we are working on a project Hangman game in the previous video I have just given you an introduction how to play Hangman game what is Hangman game right now I have asked you to draw a flowchart of this game before just you know start writing the code so how to draw a flowchart step by step see first thing is what you have to guess uh one player will guess a word right so we'll generate a word right so first is start the flowchart first step is we are going to start then what generate a word random word right you will be having a word list and generate a random word from that list now obviously in the last example we have seen Apple we have generated apple plus this would not be shown to the second player one two three four five these five blank faces would be shown only right because there are five letters so you have to generate as many blanks as the letters in that word so third step is this one after generating these blanks now user will guess a letter or maybe you can say ask a user to guess a letter now we will check the guest letter is correct or not if user has guessed X so we'll check if x is there or not for each position right so now check check if the guest letter is present in the word or not two cases can be there like maybe yes it is present or no if the letter is present if suppose I have guessed a so a is present so I'll replace this blank with this letter right so replace the blank with the guest letter right because that is correct if no then you are going to lose a life so lose a life right now when to when the game would be over if there is no Blank Space in this word right means you have guessed all the letter right then game over means you are going to win right one is one one condition is this so now we are going to check are all these blank spaces are filled or not so two cases can be there yes or no if no then again guess a letter so if no then again guess a letter if yes then obviously we are going to exit but second condition for game or Resort next is lose a life right so if you are out of lives then also game over and you are going to print a message you are going to lose so now it will be checked out of lives still any live remaining or you know life remaining or not you are out of lives or not if yes out of life then game over so here they are going to meet like like this and game over or print an appropriate message if no if there are still lives remaining then again what control will go here you have to then again guess a letter so I guess this is not too tough this is what a flowchart of Hangman game now according to this flowchart now we have you know divided or problem in simpler one now you have to write down the code right the steps you have to do what what first of all will generate a word from a word list this thing will do then we are going to replace these blanks so we have you know divided or complex problem into these smaller smaller problems so you have to focus first on this thing how to generate a word from a word list random word actually so you if you have you are aware about this random module then you can do this is easily right so what knowledge you have to you know till now what you have learned like random module for Loop while loop a membership operator also like in not in these kind of things you have to use to make this project right okay now in the next video we'll be seeing the complete code right so now I'll show you in the next video till then bye take care
