hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of cloning path and programming language in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise that was a simple one like uh you have to just write down a program to find out the number is prime or not right I hope you have done that now we'll be working on a project I think this is Project number four till now we have discussed in the series three project rock paper scissor one was password generator and one was Hangman game I think this is what one or you can check out the python playlist on my uh Channel and that is Caesar Cipher we are going to implement Caesar Cipher so let me just brief you first if you don't know what is Caesar Cipher and all about right so this is what basically a technique to send secret messages encryption techniques now uh nowadays like in WhatsApp also sometimes you got those messages like the messages are encrypted these kind of things like so whatever you will send the message as a simple text like I want to send hello so that is a simple plain message but that would be first encrypted into some other form then it would be sent to the receiver and the receiver can decrypt that message yeah we have some technique how it will be encrypted and decrypted that message so for this we have many uh encryption and decryption techniques one is Caesar Cipher this is the simplest one the basic one right so that you know hackers cannot if they are going to hack your message they are not able to get the message as it is plain text right they'll get some other C4 text like whatever we will send that is known as the plane text and after in after applying some encryption technique that text would be known as C for text or Cipher text you can see that becomes Cipher text and one is plain text like this hello is plain text so that would be converted into psycho text that is known as encryption and at the receiver end the ciphertext would be converted back to plain text that technique is known as decryption okay the basic one I'm going to tell you right now now what is the Caesar Cipher what encryption and decryption technique would be used it is the simplest one basically you can say it's a substitution Cipher so see how many alphabet we have like 26 so I'm writing like a b c d e something like this right so while encrypting there is a key right we are going to shift the numbers or you can see the shift key suppose the key is one shift key is one so now this a becomes B B becomes c c becomes D like this D becomes e f g so this is plain text and this is ciphertext if the shift key shift key is 1 we are going to shift these numbers right if the shift key is 2 so we are going to shift these sorry those not numbers alphabets by two so if the shift key is 2 then the cipher text becomes a becomes 1 2 C a becomes c b becomes 1 2 D like this and so on this is what encryption this is how encryption is to be done and at the place at the receiver end what the decryption would be done how if the shift key is to means C and D rather than a b we have sent c d so at the receiver end this is the c for text ciphertext the key is 2 so we are going to shift C and D backward to place so C becomes 1 to a d becomes 1 to B this is decryption I hope you got the basic idea of scissor Cipher right how the shifting is to be done while encryption and while decryption so the formula basic formula is for encryption the formula is it's like you can say X plus n more 26. here x is the letter suppose letter is a so X is a plus the N is the shift key shift key is supposed to so n is 2 more 26 more means module operator mode 26. right so this is the this is the case X means the letter or you can say that position of that letter because when we write down all the alphabet then index we are going to start obviously from 0 so 0 1 2 3 4 5 up to 25 Z would be having index 25. right so X means this a a the position is 0 0 plus 2 means 2 more 26. 2 more 26 becomes 2. right so at the place means two means now we will find out at second position what is the letter c so it would be a would be replaced with c right and the decryption for same is same like maybe x i but rather than this plus we'll do minus mode 26. so if you are sending a a becomes C if the shift key is 2 so x i means what is the position of that letter C is what index is 2 2 minus n is what 2 2 minus 2 is 0 0 mode 26 is 0 so at zeroth index we have a so at the time of decryption the C becomes that's correct so this is the formula and if by chance this this DN value this becomes negative so we'll do what we will add 26 to this number simple see if the cipher in ciphertext we have this this letter d so d for the for a position for D is 3 so 3 minus rather than 2 suppose rather than 2 and value the shift keys 15 shift key suppose 15. so 3 minus 15 more 26 minus 12 more 26 so if this value is what negative this t n value is what negative is so right now add 26 to this it becomes 14 now 14 divided 14 modulo 26 becomes 14. at 14 we will having O So D would be converted to O like this okay now let me just show you what kind of output you will get when you will run your project right it will give you some idea how to implement that thing what kind of exact output I want right okay so once you implement this thing the output should be something like this like type encrypt for encryption and decrypt for decryption so I want to encrypt first now type type your message so like hello Jenny a shift number suppose three any shift number the key you can give so the encrypted result is k h o r m h q b see the space is as it is hello Janice hello space Jenny and here we have space as it is so again it will ask IPS if you want to go again otherwise no yes I want to go again I want to decrypt now so type decrypt for decryption now type your message so I want to decrypt the same message so let's just copy paste this and type your message right and the shift number should be obviously same so it should be 3 must be 3. so here is the decrypted result that is halogen you want from say ciphertext to plain text now again if yes you want to go again otherwise no so no and that's it it will say goodbye so this kind of output I want so now we have to try this out so I hope you got what is C is a cipher the basics the introduction of this thing now in the next video you will see the solution we'll implement this project so now we'll see in the next video till number bye take care
