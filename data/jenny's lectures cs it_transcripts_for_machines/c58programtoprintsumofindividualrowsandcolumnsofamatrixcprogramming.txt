so in the series of learning programming in see we are discussing some programs on Matrix or you can say 2D array in this video we'll talk about a program where we will find out sum of individual rows and columns like this is a matrix 3 into 3 Matrix individual rows means this one row one 2 and three so sum would be for four for this Row for this row 10 for this row it's four sum of individual column is like something like this for this column it's three then 10 then five it should print like this individual rows and columns not all the elements not some of all the elements right how we will print this thing that we'll discuss in this video first of all ryun this program on this whiteboard then I'll practically also I'll show you on my laptop so now back to the program first of all we are going to enter this Matrix right just declare 3 into uh 3 into 3 Matrix and I and J two Loops as well as some no two variables for some one for rows and one for columns so I'm taking suppose S1 and S2 for rows and columns S1 for rows and S2 for sum of columns right or maybe for better understanding I'm writing Sr here uh this is for row and this is for column sum of rows and columns right now input or you can say read this metrix I hope uh everybody is clear with the syntax because we have used the syntax many times right I scanf IJ this is to read The Matrix 3 into three Matrix three columns and three rows right now we will access the elements and as well as we are going to print the sum right so obviously two for loop I should be Zer I I Less Than 3 and I ++ right now see I haven't initial initialized these two zero and previous videos I have told you you have to initialize sum to zero otherwise it will take any garas value why because I'm going to initialize it in this for Loop because I am going to print I'm going to sum the individual rows so after sum after doing sum of this row right that is four that sum of our variable should again be initialized with a zero for this row otherwise if you will not again initialize it with a zero then it will do what for some for first row it's four then in four only it will add these values maybe you're not getting this point right now but it's okay I'll ryun this program then you'll get it better right so where we will initialize these sum within this for Loop right Sr zero and s c is also zero right or you can initialize something like this sral to S equal to 0 right now another for Loop J equal to 0 and J Less Than 3 and J ++ now in this for Loop we are going to do sum right so sum of rows sum R plus a of I and that would be stored in Sr right and sum of column sc+ A of now for columns we will do what ji we will interchange it right and that's it now after this for loop after this inner loop we are going to print sum of row or you can say rather than writing this small I'm writing Sr equal to percentage D and sorry Sr comma s Cal to uh percentage D in one line line only I'm printing both the sum Sr comma s c right see I'm taking this Sr and SC like in capital letters just to make you understand like and these are some of rows and some of columns but according to the naming Convention of that variables you can take it like first variable first you know that letter of this should be small it's better to take small so you can take it in small letters also right or you can take it something like this like sum and row and sum and column like this you can also take right now let me just dry run this program for you then you will get the working of this form right see this I hope you got I have entered this one right now see I value is zero fine I less than three yes condition true enter here now Sr Sr and S C Sr s c both are zero initialized with zero within this four Lo right now J is also zero condition true yes again enter here now see SR plus a of i j Sr is zero plus a of i j i and J both are zero a of IJ means this thing 1 so 1 + 0 that is one that would be given to this Sr that is one now SC C plus a of j i now both I and J are equal that is 0 0 so same variable we will xess one and 1 + SC is z and again it will become one right now we are in this inner loop now j++ J becomes one condition two yes again enter here now SR plus a of i j j is now one now Sr is 1 plus a of 0 1 0 1 means this one 2 so 2 + 1 3 so 3 would be assigned now to Sr now SC plus SC is 1 1 plus a of now J I see it is for column right so that is why means we are accessing we we we have to access this two right or let me just change it I'm just doing it what uh five so now we we have to access this five for this column that is why I have interchanged rather than I I'm taking j i so now J is 1 and I is z 1 0 five this element five so 5 + 1 that is 6 and now SC becomes six right now again j++ J becomes now two condition true yes enter here now SR plus a of now J is 2 02 02 means this one so Sr is 3 3 + 1 that is 4 SC plus a of now J is 2 2 0 2 0 this variable you want to exess that is zero so value would be same six right now again j++ J becomes three but now condition is not true so exit from this Loop Inner Loop and after this inner loop whatever the statement that would be executed so now here obviously we have done sum of first row and sum of First Column this is four 2 1 3 and four and this is six yeah this so we have to print this one four and six that is why within this for Loop outer for Loop I'm printing printing Sr now output would be Sr equal to 4 and s c equal to what six that would be the output right but still we are in this outer Loop so now I ++ now I becomes 1 right now we want to sum of we want that it should give sum of this row and this column second one so that is why again we have to initialize this Sr to Zer and SC to zero if you will not initialize then it will take what 4 and six so 4 plus and 6 Plus so it will not give correct output that is why now I ++ i1 condition true again enter here now that is why I'm initializing this Sr and SC in this four Loop not here I hope now you got my point now again Sr and SC are 0 0 J is again now zero condition true again enter here now SR plus now Sr is Zer plus a of now I value is 1 J value is Zer so it will excess 1 0 1 0 that is this one 1 5 0 + 5 5 so it is 5 SC plus SC 0 + J is what J value is zero and I value is one so it will exess 0 1 0 and one this one this two because I want Su of second column now second row and second column so now 0 + 2 is 2 now j++ now J becomes one condition true again enter here SR plus a of I is 1 J is also one 1 one that is three means it becomes 8 SC plus both are one one that is this three so this becomes five again it becomes two condition true enter here Sr + a of 1 and now J is 2 1 2 1 and two this one 1 and two five 8 + 5 is 13 and sc+ now J is what two and this is it is 1 2 1 means 2 and 1 so I want to access now this five this five we are accessing although both value are same but I'm accessing this five let me change it it is 15 suppose right so now I'm accessing this 15 so 15 + 5 is 20 right now j++ J becomes three condition is not true and exit from the inner loop and now again we will print Sr = 13 SC C = to 20 now again I become two condition true enter here and again we are going to initialize it with 0 and zero because now we are going to calculate sum of third row and third column I hope you can dry run this completely at your own right no need to complete it here so I guess it's clear to you now the logic how to do sum of individual rows and columns right so now let me just show you the output on my screen let me do the Practical of this thing so now let me create one more file for you and I'm just writing what row column sum dot C right now we'll write main function and same we'll take an array of size 3 into three and I J some row I'm taking and one is some column I'm taking right I'm just writing here enter Matrix and and now I'm just writing the logic to read The Matrix within this for Loop we will use scanf sorry it should be address of a of I and J right and that's it now what we will do uh now we will do sum right so now again I'm just copying the full loop from above okay so the condition would be same within this outer loop we are going to what initialize what sum row equal to both would be zero some row and some column right now i j and here rather than scan F what just use the formula first of all sum row plus a of IG and here plus a of ji right and here I'm going to print sum row equal to percentage D and comma and then sum column equal to percentage D so two variable 2 percentage D first percentage D would be replaced with whatever the value in some row and second would whatever the value in some column variable right and I guess that's it it should be int main right let me save it and now let me run it I hope it will work say it is asking enter Matrix so I'm entering here what value 1 2 2 two this is second row 3 three and three this is third row so I think I should print the Matrix also then you will get it better let me write down the logic to print Matrix rather than scanf here we will write print F and a ofi right SLT and here we are writing print F slash okay now it should print the Matrix Matrix is I'm printing like this first of all it should print like this so now let me run it Center Matrix it is asking one one sorry see it is asking enter Matrix so 1 one one 2 2 2 3 3 3 see metrix is 111 first row so call the sum should be three for second row it's six for third it's nine right now for this column Matrix 1 2 3 sum sum is all the column should be like same six so yeah it is printing correct output so you can try it at your own and maybe you can modify it like some of rows columns as well as some of diagonal you can also print right so that is assignment for you you can print that thing and you can send me that program maybe you can message me on my on my Instagram account right so now I'll see you in the next video with a new program till then byebye take care
