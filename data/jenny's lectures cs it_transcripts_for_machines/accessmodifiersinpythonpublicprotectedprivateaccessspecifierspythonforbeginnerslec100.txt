hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing oops Concept in the previous video we have seen what are abstract methods and Abstract classes and we have also seen like what is abstraction basically hiding the implementation detail from the user or we can suggest showing the essential details to the user just showing the functionalities okay what to do not have to do just show the user what to do the functionality is not have to do those things right so that is basically abstraction but now the uh you know the thing is how we are going to hide actually the details from the user the implementation details from the user because in abstraction uh in general we can say more precisely if I say then in abstraction is a process where we just identify which things or which methods or which variables or which parts or which functionalities right is to be hidden from the user and which is to be shown to the user part users that is a theoretical process it's a thought process only you can say a thought process right but actually how we are going to hide those things in real life if suppose something is very precious to you right like some money or jewelry or anything so how we are going to hide that thing we generally put that thing in a locker we have a lock we have a key or we just have some xsco digital lock or something like this we put that that thing there in a log in a locker right but have this thing you are going to achieve in programming it's not like that we have actual lock we have actual key and we can put that thing on our program no right so how you are going to implement that security type of thing because abstraction encapsulation these things are data hiding information adding these things are related to a concept security right okay now for that we have excess specifiers I hope you have heard you have three type of access specifier public protected and private not in Python in every language like in Java also we have in C plus plus also we have these X specifiers right so first of all generally we will discuss what is public protected and private then specifically in Python how we are going to achieve that thing how we are going to apply these excess specifiers in your program right that you will see with the help of an example right okay now let's take one example um public transport buses and all so these are publicly available anyone can use that public transport anyone right so that thing is public so same like in program when you are creating a project when you're designing a software then you are working on a project then if you are following that oop approach objectoriented programming approach then obviously we will use those OP features definitely abstraction encapsulation some hiding features and classes objects and polymorphism these kind of things right so if you are following this op approach then we make some classes we create some object in classes we will have attribute of the classes we will have methods of that classes using object we can access those variables or you can say those member member functions and member variables so you can say attributes or methods of the class right we have a class and there we have attributes and methods attributes mean means what the class has and Method means what it does like if I am a class an entity Jenny I'm a class then attributes what I have those would be like class person what I have those are attributes right and what I does like I teach right I do cycling I do swimming so these are my activities these are my methods right or I have like laptop I have chair I have camera I have two eyes I have a nose these are attributes what I have right so now if these attributes and methods are public then anyone can use those methods and attributes means anyone means outside of this class also we can use these methods and attributes right publicly available five best thing you will get it you know when we will discuss practical just you know you have to be clear with this public keyword now protect Ive what see now public notice for everyone now suppose you have your own car right so you and your family member can use that car maybe your friends can use your relatives will ask you will borrow that car from you and can use right but it is not available for public it's not like that anyone can use that car so that is kind of protected right and private means what suppose like I have my own cycle so that cycle is private to me I you know don't allow anyone to write my cycle not even to my family member right so that is private to me my cycle right like if you have a gaadi we have a car that is kind of protected family members can use that car or friends and like this right so in programming also protected means if some variable or some some attribute or method if you have declared those method and attribute protected means we get this within this class we can use as well as the class the derived class of this class if I drive a class like maybe suppose my name Jenny and I or you can say female person so this class is derived from this class this is base class so any attribute or method which is protected Drive class can also use those protected method and attributes right only that class within that class and within the drive class but not outside of these classes we can use protected attribute and methods now private means within this class only within this class only means my cycle I can only use one cycle right that is like private not even the drive class can use those attributes and member methods if some attribute is private here then if we drive a class from here then that attribute will not be derived to this class using this class object we cannot use that attribute right so I hope you got the difference between protected and private public is I guess that is very common right okay now generalized that you have about public protected and private public means outside of the class anyone can use that outside of the class within the class as well protected means within the class and within the drive class private means within the class only right okay now we will see this thing with the help of program but actually let me just clear one thing in Python we don't have such you know uh strong concept of these public protected and private specifiers right obviously we have like public one but not strongly we cannot make a you know variable or method strongly you can say private right you can make it private but we have some method using that we can even use those private method attributes outside of the class right so maybe you will say what is the use of this this thing okay so let's create a new file here in the project abstraction demo only and let's name it access underscore specifiers Dot py simply you will first create a class suppose I am creating a class student right so let's have some attribute and methods of this class right let's have a Constructor and we are going to initialize some methods and attributes like suppose just passing name of the student right and how we are going to initialize the attribute name I'm taking self like dot name is equal to the parameter name is name only one attribute I am having and one function I'll have like maybe display so using a string we will just print the name like hi myself self dot whatever the name will fetch that name from student class this is the display right let's create a you can say variable sorry object of this student class right student and what you need to pass name so the name of the student is maybe like Rahul foreign if you want to print the name of the student then S1 simply dot name you can access this thing right as well as you can access the you can say this function also S1 Dot display the method also let's run this and see name Rahul and hi myself Rahul from student class right so not by default these attribute is name the function is display of this class by default these things are public all the attribute and methods right outside of the Class C we are using this thing is within the class this is the area within the class like these line tail Fifth Line and six seven eight these are outside of the class we are using outside of the class obviously we are creating object and we are accessing name and display so public like this is what publicly we are using fine so by default all the attributes and methods are public so this is public specifier or you can say Public Access specify next is protected now in Python there is no such keyword public private and protected unlike Java and C plus plus we have just underscore at Double underscore okay now let's take a protected attribute I am taking attribute like underscore roll number sorry here I will not uh specify sorry underscore Let Me Clear one thing to you just the parameter name no underscore underscore should be here because the attribute is this name so attribute we are using here so the attribute should be protected not this parameter name right so I am taking like self Dot and one underscore and uh I'm taking like row number is equal to roll number so now name is public and this row number is protected attribute or we can say this is public instance variable and this is protected instance variable instance means nothing but like object so like I have told you protected means within the class we can use and in the derived class as well so let's first create one more class that is derived class also so let's create one more class then you will get it better we have another class branch and this is derived from student class okay and let's not write down anything here just pass now see these are name roll number this roll number we can access within this Drive class as well right so let's create an object of derived class now now it's not like directly you can create the object of this because let's run this and I'll show you whatever you will get C student init missing two required positional argument name and dollar in line number nine when you are creating this object of Branch because this is derived from student class and in student class obviously whenever you create an object Constructor would be called init Constructor it will check in Branch class do we have init Constructor no so it will call instructor of super class super classes student class and in student class we have Constructor that is expecting two arguments name and roll numbers so that is why you need to pass your name and row number so name suppose I am passing like maybe Nisha and uh roll number like 22. now it will not give any error now with help of B1 if I want to print name okay fine because name is you will say it's public so it will not it should not give any error fine let's try to access protected variable also B1 dot what is underscore roll number now what do you think let's run this C Nisha and 22 we are able to access this row number as well outside of these classes outside of Drive class outside of Base Class now maybe you will say now what's the use of using this protected that is why I am saying to you in Python there is no such complete restriction of using protected and even private variables so it is responsibility of the program a good programmer not to touch not to you know modify not to access protected and private variables and methods outside of the class environment right like protected means we have a car that is I have given you the example protected but if someone got my key my car key any any random people any random person what my car like I lost my car key right so it is responsibility of that person to return my key and to not to use my car right so it's not like I have a complete control I have complete restriction that no one can use no public person can use my car if someday I lost my key then anyone can use my car so same in Python it is the responsibility of a programmer good programmer if you have seen like in a class we have variable protected method private variable private method so not to use those methods and uh you know attributes outside of the class environment okay so now like if suppose we have a function here here also outside of the class we have any public function and within this any public function it's not within these classes right here I am creating an object of Branch this class and within this function only I'm going to print B1 name and B1 wrote row number so maybe you will say like this is a public person show data is public person right and you can think like okay name is public transport but roll number is my car and this depth this show data is any public person right so let's run this and let me just show you the output it will not give any error and obviously it will not print anything because we haven't called this function we have just defined this function so to run this you have to call the function show data let's run this now see Nishan 22 so any public person is also using my name and roll number like my public transport as well as my car the same okay like I have lost my key so anyone is using so it is a responsible to that public person or the responsibility to the programmer not to use these roll number this protected kind of thing in this function right python does not provide any strict restriction right it's flexible it just these are just underscore double lens for these are just just a name convention okay now this is protected so better to use this protected variable within uh this class environment like in display uh myself this with roll number and how you can access the roll number self dot underscore roll number with roll number this from student class right not to access this thing outside better to avoid using this thing outside okay now if I create S1 Rahul and just pass the roll number like 23. okay and with the help of this one dot I am calling display so let's run this Nisha from the this public function and I myself traveled with roll number 23 from student class so directly we are not accessing roll number outside of the class we are just using we are just accessing that polymer with the help of the method which is inside the class so that is a good idea right and outside of the class environment we can modify these methods and variables suppose I want to modify let's just uh comment out this public function and before fetching this I want to modify S1 Dot name equal to it's not Rahul ICS so I want to modify the name that is also possible let's run this and now this time it will show you see ronak with roll number 23 right and now I can modify that roll number also S1 underscore number is equal to like 45 so let's run this and see what we are getting C columnar is 45. but better not to modify not to access protected thing outside of the class better to use within this class only right although we can access I have shown you I can modify you also right but a responsible programmer programmer would not do this thing right okay now this is protected in private now let's sorry let public and protect it now let's take a private attribute let's take a private attribute and uh suppose I'm taking self dot age age should be private so to make a attribute or method private you have to prefix that thing with double underscore sorry double underscore and I'm taking a uh attribute name age and here I am passing H so is equal to H so this is this is private okay now even the derived class cannot use this private you can say variable or private method let's do this let's make this method also private display so let's try to create S1 student Rahul 23 and next is age so let's pass age is like maybe 20. okay let's make first this public only let's print if you want to access this S1 note is outside of the class it will give a c student attribute error student object has no attribute underscore underscore H because you cannot access private attribute to private method outside of the class right but yeah there is a Technique we can access and that is known as name mangle that is why I have told you in Python there is no such mechanism or there is no such access specifier that completely restrict you from accessing private methods and attributes there are still some other ways you can use so using name mangling we can use private even private variables and Method now if you want to use name angling we can do with the help of three method like with the dir method and you can access let me just show you first how with the dir method you can use you can do that thing so we are not going to modify this thing that I have told you okay now see now and this private thing we can use within the class not even outside not even in the drive class so if with the help of like maybe B1 is equal to branch even if this is the drive class obviously from student class right so with the help of this derived class object also we cannot access this age right that will also give same error Branch object has no attribute age and even within this we cannot access age like if I am defining a function here diff maybe you think because we have derived Branch from students so all the attribute and method of student class are obviously of child class now so let's show print my age is and with the help of F string we are going to print hashed underscore underscore age and simply just here call B1 Dot show so maybe you think we are accessing within the class environment not outside of the drive class so maybe it will run let's run this still it will give error Branch object has no attribute name branch age right now see it has done mangling underscore Branch underscore and storage now what is my name angling I'll tell you but still you are getting an error right attribute error so in derived class also you cannot use now in Drive class we can use uh that um protected if you want to use like my age is this it will give error so my because roll number is protected underscore number it will not give any error okay we are we are accessing this thing so let us comment out this and let's run this now see my name my roll number is 45 and this roll number only I just want to show you because this is from the show function my roll number is test right and this is the display function we are calling from student class display right so protected we can use in in Drive class but private you cannot even use in Drive class that is the main difference between protected and private variables and sorry attributes and methods now even you can make this method private display and suppose let's comment out everything here and just we are just calling display underscore underscore display now this time it will give error because it is private see student object has no attribute and this one is for display so you cannot pull display function because that is private to this student if we have one more function like display private data that is public and within this function we are calling that private function that is display so my name my roll number and this one to access that private attribute also age this much years old with roll number and like this it will print and this display we are calling this and outside of this we are just calling that function S1 Dot display private data let's run this now you will not get any error see myself travel 20 years old with roll number 23 from student class now it is printing because we are not accessing private data outside of this class see we are using private data age as well as the function sorry the method within this class only not outside of this class now if you want to use this thing outside of the class obviously that is also we have one you can say mechanism for that that is name mangling so first let's do name angling with the dir method so how you will do that thing print just call dir method and pass the object of that class on which you want to do manually so on student I want to do manually because there also I there only I have private protected in public so there is no need of exiting that public thing with the help of mangling but specifically manganese for private things so dir and just pass the object S1 okay let me just show you let me just print see carefully now we have see it will show you all the valid attributes of that class basically of that class object so all the valid attributes are see you can say age but that is mangled and what is the mangling process all the uh you can say that attribute and methods which are prefixed with double underscore that are mangled and what is the process that would be prefixed with underscore class name underscore class name is student underscore underscore see underscore class name underscore underscore display so these are the this is Method this is attribute right but there are many method and attribute class dir Doc and many things as you can see here and see you can see also here underscore roll number that is also valid attribute and name is also validated but obviously that is public and so all the valid attributes so this we can access now how you can access that private method and attribute using this technique now let me just show you how you can access if outside of the class you want to access age then how you will print let's just remove this thing and I just want to print S1 DOT first underscore class name student underscore underscore age 20. now you are getting age we are accessing age that is private attribute outside of the class environment with the help of object still you are accessing but there is a mangling process so this is the process if you want to call that function also S1 Dot just prefix with class name underscore underscore display let's run this see age is 20 and I myself Route 20 year old with roll number 23 from student class so that is you can say body of this function age and roll number so maybe you will see now what is the use of this private and all what is the use of the double underscore directly obviously you cannot access those private things you can access but there is some method right like same I have told you it is responsibility of a programmer to not touch these private and protected variable and methods outside of the class environment not modified not modify these things right if I have my cycle that is private to me and I don't want to share that with anyone with like no one even no one from my family member because that is private to me I love my cycle but if anyone knows the code or the you know lock then obviously my family member can use that thing but it is a responsibility of the person who is using my cycle right to not use that thing because that is private to me same thing it is a responsibility of a good programmer to not use private and protected variables and methods outside of the class environment public you can use so I hope the Funda of access specifiers are clear to you guys it's just a name convention in Python not any strict mechanism or rule why so I hope you got the concept of access specifiers in Python so now in the next video we'll see encapsulation bye take
