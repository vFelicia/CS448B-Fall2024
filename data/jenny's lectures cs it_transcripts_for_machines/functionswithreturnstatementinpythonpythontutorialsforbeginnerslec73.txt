hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one project that was Caesar Cipher right until now in the series we have discussed something about functions as well right like what is a function basic and function without argument and functions with argument right and then types of arguments like keyword positional arbitrary arguments these things we have discussed but till now we haven't discussed functions with return value right means a function is returning something to the caller that thing we haven't discussed till now right so this thing we'll be discussing in this video functions with return value right everything like how a function is going to return a value and how this function will be returning multiple values as well right types of return statement like implicit return explicit return so everything about functions with return where we will be discussing with the help of example and program practical also I will show you right but before that I just want to tell you something to those who are interested to make their career in data science fit first let me just show you

let's okay as we know function if you have watched the previous videos in the series functions basically it's a block of code right which is going to perform a specific task when it is executed right how to define a function simply this keyword here we are writing a function name and if you want to parse some parameter then also you can pass one two three four edges any parameters you want then here we are having function boarding the statements this is what definition of functions but this is not going to do anything to do something whatever you write here to execute that task to perform that task you have to call the function so two main things are there defining a function and calling our functions how to call a function simply function name whatever you write here and arguments right and this is function calling right simple definition and calling of the function right now as many arguments as you want you can pass here multiple type of argument like positional keyword arbitrary this thing we have discussed till now right but see let's take one example if you are going to add two numbers so how you will Define a function div and suppose function name is ADD and suppose I am calling this function add and I'm passing two argument 5 and 4. so two parameters whatever you will write in these parentheses in these brackets while defining a function those are known as parameters while calling whatever you will pass those are known as arguments right so these are parameters A and B right and a plus b and just print C this is definition of function this is function calling right here if this function is not returning anything if you want to return if you want that the function should return rather than just print then another thing what we can do rather than print we can write down return and what you want to return this C return C so now this function is going to return whatever is there in this variable in C C we are having a plus b means 5 plus 4 is 9 so it will return 9 right so this 9 while calling where it will return to the caller so here we are calling this function so at this this line would be replaced with 9 right now there is a value so to you have to accept this value in a variable maybe in a variable so here we can maybe something like we can take a variable output and there we can just print output or simply here also print add 5 and for that also you can do right so in general a function is going to accept some arguments if any argument is not necessary that every function is going to accept some argument without argument function also possible right if any then the function is going to return sorry accept arguments process something based on those arguments or those parameters and return something or return a value where to the caller right so the value of the function is going to return to the colon that is known as return value functions return value and all the functions are having return value right maybe it's explicit or implicit so two types of return values or return statements are there explicit and implicit that will be discussing in next video in detail right this video is all about just to get you familiar with the basic return statement so generally I return a statement is a special statement that we use inside a function C make this point inside a function only if outside a function anywhere you write a return statement that will give syntax error so it is a special statement that we use inside a function yes right and what is the syntax return keyword and here we use return value whatever value you want to return but this thing is optional okay two things are there you can simply use return that's it with no return value or you can commit this complete statement do not write anything no return no return value in what the case is the function will return none this thing I will show you in practical right but you have two you know be aware about these things you can write down any return value and this return value is any any objects in Python we know everything is object so it can be a numeric value in flowed or complex value or any sequences or collection like list double set dictionary or any user defined functions module packages anything right or simple return also you can write or you can omit this complete statement as well right these many cases can be there with return statement okay now let's see this thing with the help of example or program okay so let's create a new file function with roton value right let's take the very basic and simple example what addition so we are going to call a function addition and suppose I am passing like 5 and 4 okay so this is calling of function now before calling you have to Define that function otherwise it will give error So Def same function name add and we are passing two arguments so just take two parameters A and B and suppose I am writing C is equal to a plus B and here only I am not returning I am just printing C right so this is the very simple example let's run this see you get the output is 9. now if you don't want to print and I want to return this value so just return statement you have to use return this keyword and return value what you want to return C right now whatever you will return this return c means it will return 9 so this 9 it will return this value to the caller caller is this one so here it will replace this with 9 but we are not printing nine here or we are not accepting that value in any variable so what output you will get C it will print nothing because we are not printing anything so one way is you can simply print here right so this this would be replaced with nine right and it will print 9. so let's run this see now it will print line or other thing is what if you are not printing here you can simply like take a variable and just store that value in this result and you can print here result that will also give you same result that is 9. so here we are returning something or rather than these two lines we can simply do so what return a plus b that is also fine we are having now less number of lines let's run this and this will also give you same result 9. right if rather than a plus b if I simply write here like I am writing C is equal to a plus b and just return nothing else right return but no return value we are providing so let's run this C in this case it is going to return none fine because we are we are using return statement and a return value is nothing so it will pass here none in result we have none and we are going to print none if you completely omit this line we are not Printing and we are not writing this statement even the return keyword in that case also it will return none because this is what implicit return two types of return I have told you explicit plus implicit explicit means we are specifying the return statement implicit means by default if you are not specifying any return statement by default thus python in Python this function will return none implicitly so here also it will returning none right on C now it will work fine okay invalid syntax it's RN let's run this and see nine okay if other than we can use this return statement if the special statement we can use this within the definition of the function right if other than outside of the definition I am using return or C or may be simply return so it will give syntax error see return outside function so we cannot use return statement outside a function this thing you need to take care so this is simple return a function with simple return value now one exercise for user you can say one quiz for you is suppose I am passing any line or suppose my name right and you have to convert that into title case title case means every word first letter would be capital and all other letters are smooth so let's write down this thing now we are suppose we are going to format our name so I'm calling a function format name and there I am passing my name so first thing like Jenny in capital and last name I am passing like Katrina all capital and general smooth so you need to format you need to convert this thing into title case right now title case means you can Google this out like this Jenny the first letter of every word would be capital and all the other letters are small this is title case okay Now define a function depth and the function name is format name right and here we are I'm passing two arguments so two variable to parameter first name last name right and there how to convert this thing we have a functional inbuilt function title so we just use that thing so first name I want to convert into title case so how to convert the name of the variable first name Dot title that's it same last name Dot title so it will convert both these into title case okay now simply return or simply print rather than return first print and suppose in formatted string I am printing first name comma last name right let's run this C okay it hasn't converted into in this because we are simply okay the names are same because we are simply what we are doing we are just printing F name and last name as it is after formatting after formatting this let's formatted F name save this in another variable formatted last name now what you need to print formatted F name comma formatted L name let's run this Cena Jenny J capital khatri K Capital otherwise all the letters are small right let's remove this comma as well let's run this see Jennifer 3 this is title case okay now rather than printing just return so rather than print simply replace this with return and as it is we can write down that is fine f formatted name f formatted L name now here we are going to print so before this simply write down print this is one way let's run this and see right now if you are not going to print here just because we know whatever this function is going to return that as a string so you can take a variable name here like formatted name equal to that's it and in print we can simply print formatted name see Jenny right so I hope now you have some idea how the function with return value Works how we can use this return statement just return keyword and return value whatever you want to return this return value can be anything numeric collection string or anything right different different variations on this return will be discussing in later videos right so I hope you would have a function with the return value works right now a function can can return multiple values as well and a return statement can be written can be of two types implicit explicit and what is difference between return and print this thing will be discussing in next videos take care
