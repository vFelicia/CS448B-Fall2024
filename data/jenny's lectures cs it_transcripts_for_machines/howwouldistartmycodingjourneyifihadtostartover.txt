hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in this video we will discuss if I had to restart my career or more precisely if I say if I had to restart my coding Journey from a fresh then what would be my strategy what I will learn which language technology framework or in which direction I'll go what would be my path or you can say what advice I will give to myself right so this thing we'll be discussing in this video so mainly if this is the case with with my with me then I'll Focus mainly on three things so basically three things we'll discuss in this video right first thing I will learn JavaScript definitely yeah no Java python or C++ I'll go for JavaScript because this is according to my personal interest I want to go in this development field actually right but apart from this interest kind of thing from joob point of view also this is a very good field to go into right because there are many job opening also for software developer jobs as we know salary is also good like you you'll get a good package so this is also a point to go into this field web development field right so I learn first JavaScript definitely right it's not like that this is the only way but it's my interest and definitely JavaScript is no scaling it is now everywhere everywhere almost right so the is having a very good score you can enter into this tech industry with this field also I mean using your development skills learn webd and you can enter into this Tech field and you can reach up to a very good level into those mang Fang companies as well right so yeah I know actually that another path is also there like uh go for DSA if you are good in that field that in that thing also DSA kind of thing then you can also enter into the these companies right like if you are from a good college and these type of companies the top tech companies are coming to your college for on campus placement so definitely in interview they ask DSA question almost in every round So based on that also if you are having one or two project you know and not very very good project but you have like yeah good project and you are very good in DSC in problem solving you have those skills then definitely you have a great chance to enter into these companies but yeah I know DSA is tough actually and it's not possible for everyone to master DSA right those algorithms and all so in my case I'll choose that second path first JavaScript in web I I'll go in development type of uh development field right then second thing I'll start working on projects yeah rather than you know uh devoting or wasting more and more time on those programs only like we do print hello world program or palindrome factorial Feb series pattern type of program and many programs are there these kind of and we we we understand and we we know devote so much time by uh you know to understand the concept behind these programs and you know just for writing these programs yeah that thing is also important right just devote you know dedicate your time for this thing also but not much much much time start working projects as soon as possible right because this is very important when you are going to work on a start making simple project maybe just only you know by that that front end only right by clicking on that button this would be be this would happen or redirect a page or these kind of things simple things then uh attach or work on back end also have some database for your project because obviously in industry or in real life that would be required you have to deal with data also so you have you have some knowledge of if you have some knowledge of database that would be good for you then work on back end also have some database SQL my SQL or mongodb or any other database right connectivity and all so front end as well as back end because see uh when we will be working on projects then these concept all these Theory concept these Loops concept or those programs you write in the beginning those concept would be more clear to you guys when you work on project so this thing is important right start working on Project as soon as possible I'll be doing this thing if I had to restart my my journey right I'll start making projects simple project then high level project intermediate level project high level project right and yeah once you will work in on projects then definitely you will stuck and you will have some doubts and you'll be frustrated but it's okay that is normal it happens with everyone with every fresher we can say or every beginner right so keep patience and everything will be fine there is solution for every problem on internet if you search properly right so second thing this thing I'll do working on projects right third thing I'll maintain definitely my GitHub this is very important nowadays this is very crucial please maintain your GitHub profile right whatever you do any project small project any project you have or whatever you have upload that to GitHub right maintain your GitHub profile file that is important one because nowadays your online visibility is crucial playing a crucial role right because sometimes it happens just by looking your get profile get a profile LinkedIn profile or if you have any other uh any other profile on any other coding platform right many coding platform uh also there nowadays so directly these recruiters contact you for you just directly got an interview call right they'll not check your resume so one thing one advantage of this thing is what you don't have to focus on your resume like how how should be your resume a perfect resume because directly you will get a call for interview just maintain your online portfolio nowadays this thing is important right rather than you know I guess focusing more and more on your resume so whatever you do any project or anything just just maintains that thing online whether it's your GitHub profile it's your LinkedIn profile or any other Professional Profile that is important one so this thing I will do definitely maintain my GitHub profile so these three things definitely I do if I had to restart my coding journey I hope these points will help you too right now if you want me to upload more these kind of you know videos placement related or career related coding related then you can let me know in comment section so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
