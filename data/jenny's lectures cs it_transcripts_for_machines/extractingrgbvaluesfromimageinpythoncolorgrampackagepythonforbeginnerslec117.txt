hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning path and programming language we are discussing total Graphics right now we have discussed some basics of turtle graphics and three or four coding exercises right now one more thing I want to tell you about a package actually that is very important and you that is I think quite useful and you should be aware about that package right so suppose you have an image and it's a colorful image right and you want to extract you want to know the the colors the name of the colors from that picture so you want to extract the exact RGB values from that image right then how would you know by looking at that image maybe you will say this color is pink but in pink also we have many shades in blue also we have many shades once you go through the TK color specification there you will get a list of colors and their RGB Valu so you can check out there there right so how do you extract the exact RGB values from that image right maybe you want to use the exact same color for your project right so first we will extract obviously we have to extract the RGB values or the we have to know the name of the color from that image right so let's take one image okay look okay so let's take this image by looking at this image we can see like there is Pink some blue golden and these kind of colors but you don't know the exact shade or exact RGB values of these colors in pink also we have multiple Shades multiple RGB values right so exact RGB values I want to extract from this image for these colors then how we are going to extract right so for that we have a package color gram right you have to install that package we are going to import that package and then we are going to use that package that thing I want to show you in this video how to use that that color gr package that is why useful right so you can take any image any jpg image right so let's first let me just show you what is this color gr package so in just Google you have to search just search this color gr package and at first you will get this py pii website right and here you have this project description and how to install this thing that also you have given the command pip install this package name right so this is actually a python library that lets to extract the colors from the images right so see from this image these are the colors 10 colors almost extracted using this colorr package from this image as you can see exact colors are there right now how to use this how to install with this Command right or if you are using py Cham then also I'll show you how to install this colorr package right and how to use first read this the description of this project right obviously after installing import that colorr package and the syntax is this colorr dot we have a method extract then first is the name of the picture sweet pick do jpg and then how many colors you want to extract that from that picture six colors right so let me just show you how to do this thing so first you have to install that thing if you're using the Spy charm okay so let's create a new project first like extract colors I'm going to name this extract colors right create this and see now we are having this project extract colors right so here in this project only let's create a file there will be writing the code so any name you can take I'm take I'm giving the name main do py right okay now let's see obviously you need a picture in this project only you have to copy paste that picture from you want from the image you want to extract the colors right so I'm going to copy paste this image to my where is my this uh project py Cham project see the py cham project is extract colors so this is my project and here I'm going to paste this picture JK the name is JK right so this is the picture jk. jpg fine now in pyam also you can see here in extract colors now jk. jpj we have a picture and main. py is a file where you you are going to write the code so first you have to install the color gr package so in py charm here how we are going to install let's go to you have to click on file then then setting right and then in Python project like python interpreter and for extract colors for this here in this I want to add I want to install my packet so let's choose this project and just click on plus and here you can search colorr color gr. py right so here you can just click install package right and see the package installed successfully now you're done now you can use this one so in this main do py let's first import this color gr right now how to use what is that that uh synx colorr dot we have a method extract then first you need to give the name of the picture JK dot jpg right then comma How many colors you want to extract from that picture so by looking at that picture we can almost see like maybe there are almost 10 colors right so let's extract 10 colors from this picture and you have to obviously we will store these to maybe like colors as you can see here the syntax colors is equal to this so same synx I'm going to take the same name colors or you can take any other name and if you print now if you print these colors simply colors so let's run this so actually it is going to take few seconds according it depends on the type of the picture or the quality of the picture actually righta after few seconds now this is the list we have got this is the list first is color gr py then color RGB in bracket we have R GB value then for Second Color the same thing we have so this is going to return this colorr do extract is going to return color objects actually color objects which is having RGB hsl value and the proportion of the image was that color What proportion of the image was that color right so obviously this is going to return not actually like colors color objects here in this variable right so obviously that is a list so we can access the object by their index like first color is from the list colors and at zero index so that is first color right so okay let me just show you this thing also I only want this RGB value because in your program also if you want to use these colors then obviously you will need this RGB value that's it right randomly if you choose from any list obviously from this list we cannot choose right so if there is a list something like this something like this color list is this one having RGB value in a list in a form of tle we have RGB value RGB value so from this list randomly we can choose these RGB values and according according to that colors should be generated but first of all you have to make this list and right now we don't have this list we have something different right we have the list like colorr dot like RGB value then some hsl value percentage value and all so from that you have to extract only RGB value right if you want to extract then how you will do that thing so rather than printing these colors what we will do now we know these colors are color object so first color if you want to print is equal to from this list colors zero right equal to now if you want to print the first color then see what output you will get here we have extracted 10 colors but only we are printing printing the first color so this is our first color everything like r value this value percentage and all everything we are getting ASL RGB and all right but I want only this R GB value only 202 172 137 then how we are going to extract this thing from this object right so if you print first color dot R GB simply this thing first color. RGB let's run this see this is RGB of first color and from this RGB this is RGB value from this RGB value you want to extract only R this 202 so how you can extract I hope now you got this first color RGB do R same we can extract G and B and then we can make a new color there we will add only R GB values that's it and we are going to append these thing into a list so for 10 colors you want to do this thing so rather than this what we will do let's take a for Loop for color in colors because all the 10 colors are color object in this lastest colors so for color in the in this lest colors right first let's extract RGB value so R is equal to whatever the color object first object color in this object in this this variable would be the first object color so color dot RGB do R right why I'm writing this thing see let me just show you the documentation first if you extract the RGB value then this is the method first color. RGB right if you want to extract hsl value then this is the method hsl you can extract this thing right or if you want to extract the proportion then this is the way first color dot proportion right you can check out this description and by looking at this only I'm getting the idea like this we have to use these thing like this right so if you want to extract the red then RGB dot R from this RGB do R this is how we can extract this is how we can use one more method we have colorr dot color so color do RGB the color represented as a named tle of RGB from 0 to 255 for example like this color do hsl color do proportion like this we can extract because the extract this will return these colors as a form of color object color objects so that is why we are able to access these things using the object color do RGB like this the object name dot RGB something like this right so color RGB do R same like this we can extract rgb3 values and we can make a like new color is equal to there R comma G comma B like this right and then let's make a list suppose color list empty list and in this color list let's append the new color right and now after this for Loop let's print this color list now let me show you see now this is a list of the colors having only RGB values right and we have here 10 colors right so if you want to check like if you want to check the first color you can just search RGB calculator and click on the first link and here you can just copy paste this and click enter so this is the color 202 172 and 137 so this is the color so I don't know in our image we have this color yeah obviously we have that is why we have extracted this color but where is this color I don't know actually right maybe the background color is this right you like this you can check out every color so this is how you can extract the RGB values from any image now we have this list and you can just copy paste this list in any program from here I'm just going to copy paste this all the 10 colors right and if you want to use this in my program so let's make like uh this color list now and here just copy paste this thing so this is my color list so now every time rather than you know executing this code extracting color every time from the image now we have the colors now we can use these colors right because obviously every time you you ex then definitely it is going to take more and more time so now from this list we can use these colors right so this is how you can extract RGB values from any image I hope now you got how to use this color colorr package and what is this thing right how to extract colors from any image so now I'll see you in the next R till then by bye take care
