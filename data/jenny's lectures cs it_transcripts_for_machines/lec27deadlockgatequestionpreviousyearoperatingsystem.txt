and available resources are M now you have to find out this value of M and the question is what is the minimum value of M see here the focus is on minimum value minimum value of M such that system is deadlock free and some extra I think is also given that any process can request for any number of resources obviously that the request would be less than or equal to its maximum so its maximum requirement it cannot exceed to its maximum requirement fine now before going to this question I am going to discuss with you one small question I suppose see in my class I have five students fine and all the five students needs suppose maximum three pins here the condition is same type of resources are there the resource type should be see fine it's not like that one is blue one is black and one is green pen so here also the condition is the source type is same okay the rule is what the faculty has to buy the pence and gave the pens to student in the class now you I have to decide how many how many pens should I buy so that I can fulfill their requirements now simple answer is you just buy 15 pins because five students are there all its three maximum requirement is three so just buy 15 pens and you can fulfill the requirement but see here the focus is one you have to find out the minimum amount minimum amount of pens maybe III buy 20 pence and that is also fine in the system is not in deadlock state if I have 50 pence that is great I am able to fulfill all the requirements but I have to find out the minimum amount of pen fine see now this is the maximum requirement now suppose each student each student has requested has requested me for two two pins so a location is worth now two pens two pens and I have given two two pen to these students suppose I bought 10 pens so here we have available s 10 pins okay just for example now every student has requested me for two two pins now I have given two two pens now I do I do not have any pin because I have given 10 pens to all the students and I have now zero pens now need of these to rent is what 1 1 1 1 and 1 each student need one one more pin because maximum requirement is 3 3 pens now if suppose ROM asked me for one pin then I am NOT able to fulfill that requirement I am NOT able to fulfil requirement of any student now system is in deadlocked State see no student at starting only no student can ask me for 3 pens let us suppose in starting only rather than 2 pens ROM asked me for 3 pins so here the assumption is what as soon as the process get all its required resources it will release it has to release its resources after some amount of time so as soon as it it you know ask me for 3 pens I give him 3 pens and I'll take back all the 3 pens that is the assumption that is to be followed we have discussed to this case in previous examples so if ROM asked me for 3 pens then obviously from 10 pins I can give three pins at starting handed I just take 3 pens back and drop got completed then again Sharman like this fine so so here the the worst scenario is what every student will ask its maximum minus 1 pens 2 2 2 2 & 2 now I have only 3 pens now I have 0 I cannot fulfill any requirement now suppose ROM is asking me for 1 X trap and I am NOT able to fulfill that requirement now suppose I bought 10 plus 1 means 11 pens suppose I have fine now the remaining is I have 1 pen now now I can fulfill requirement of need of all the students suppose Ram is asking for one extra pen I just give one extra pen as soon as Ram got Rumble get three pens it he has to release all its spin then I can take three back or you can say now now I have you can say one plus two is now three and RAM got completed now sham is asking for one extra pen I can human I can fulfill that Department with three pens now action as soon as Ram will go through and I just take back all the three pens now available is worth three plus two is fine like this I can fulfill all the requirements fine so the minimum value is what 11 and how how we will calculate the minimum value just look at the maximum requirement do minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 and just do the total of this one see this one is 10 then in this total just add one resource and that is the minimum value now discuss this case with this example this general scenario now here see maximum requirement is this one you have to find out value em see this available available I have 11 so this available should be either greater than or equal to this total if suppose I put 12 pins then also fine if I bought 15 pens then also fine but minimum is what this total plus 1 so this available should be either greater than or equal to this value so see here M should be greater than equal to see maximum is a 1 a 2 up to n from all the values from 4 P when it's a 1 so we do a 11 fine plus a 2 maximum minus 1 plus HB minus 1 like this up to what up to a n minus1 fine now now plus one like this plus one so this is the case now find out M should be greater than equal to now C over a 1 plus a 2 up to a n fine now how you can write summation of a of I and I should be from 1 to n ok now next is minus C this minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 how many times minus 1 is there n times right because see a 1 a 2 up to a n and minus 1 is with each a so this minus 1 is how many times n times so you can write here minus N and plus plus 1 fine so this is the formula have to calculate minimum amount of minimum value of M such that no deadlock will be there so that value would be greater than equal to this way now let us discuss one question with the help of this formula so now let us take one equation is given five processes are given maximum requirement of these processes are given and you have to find the minimum value of M or you can say available resources so that the system is deadlock free and any process can request any number of resources at any time obviously the request should be less than or equal to this maximum need of that process maximum claim of that process right now how to calculate by applying this formula see this M should be greater than equal to the summation of ao5 summation of I is equal to 1 to N n is what number of processes 1 to 5 here what will write you I n is what n n is about 5 plus 1 now M is greater than equal if you know the total of this one CI is equal to one to five means total of this maximum because a or Y is what this one now if you know the total of this one this would be twenty seven so this is 27 minus five plus 1 and M should be greater than equal to 27 plus 128 28 minus 5 is 3 so the minimum value of M is 123 you can calculate without this formula also you just do 5 minus 1 is 4 64 61 is 5 3 minus 1 is 2 7 minus 1 is 6 6 minus 1 is what 5 just do the total of these 1 and this total would be 22 and just add 1 to this and this would also be 23 so this is how you can solve this kind of numerical let us take one more example so let us take this question also like there are five processes each process demands three resources of same type see here the condition is these type of in this type of question conditioning resources should be of same type so what is the minimum number of resources and system for deadlock free condition fine see the formula is this one M is like greater than equal to this business fine you have to find out value of M should be greater than equal to summation of I is equal to 1 2 and n is number of processes number of processes are five processes 5 here high minus 5 plus 1 so M is greater than equal to now see what is this each process demands three resources this is the maximum demand you can say three demands for same resource type so here this this value is what 3 3 3 3 3 like this fine now if you a 1 is also 3 a 2 is 3 a 3 3 a 4 is 3 and a 5 is 3 because we are having I value from 1 to 5 so when you will do total of this 1 then you will find out what 3 into 5 that is 15 minus 5 plus 1 and this should be M greater than equal to 15 plus it should be 11 so the minimum requirement of resources would be 11 so that the system is in deadlock free condition this is how you will solve these kind of vehicle I hope you got the concept so I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
