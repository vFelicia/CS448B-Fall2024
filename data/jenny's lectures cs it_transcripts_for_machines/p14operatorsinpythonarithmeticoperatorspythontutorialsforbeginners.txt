so when the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video I guess we have discussed type conversion or type casting like how to convert one data type to another data type okay and with the help of one example like we have discussed how to add digits of a two digit number that program we have discussed right so the next topic is operators in Python see we have discussed water operator plus till now like if you use this plus uh for Strings uh then it will be a concatenation of two string it will concatenate these two strings plus also means addition right so these other operators are also there and like in C and C plus plus also we have some operators arithmetic relational logical and all same in Python also we have different type of operators all the operators will be discussing one by one right with the help of examples and programs we will see practical also fine but before they just want to tell you one thing after collaborating with gate academy an academy has come up with the biggest Initiative for engineering students and the motive is to empower Engineers for this an academy is conducting a free of host scholarship test on 25th of September at 11 am and the questions are curated by gate academy top Educators and if you take this test then you can apply for gate 2023 for free yes the top 3000 rankers will get their gate 2023 registration fee refunded by an academy that is not all first ranker from each branch will get their one year college fee you know refunded by an academy up to rupees one lakh and you also stand a chance to win scholarship from pool of rupees 30 crore so this kind of test has never happened and it is a wonderful opportunity for you guys so the link the enrollment link I'll put in the description box of this video and you can use my code jkl10 to enroll for this test so go and enroll for this test right now all the element links and details you will find in the description box of this video now let's see what are operators in Python what are operators in Python see operators simply what these are some symbols so these are used to perform some operations on maybe values or maybe variables like if I say like 5 plus 2 this is what plus is what operator and this 5 and 2 these are operands or values you can say or simply if I write like a is equal to 5 b is equal to 2 then I can say a plus b so A and B are variables okay so these operators are what used to perform some operations on on either values or variables okay like plus we have so like this we have more mathematical operators also okay now in this this plus and suppose I say 5 minus 2 this minus these are operators 5 and 2 operand A and B operand okay now there are multiple there are you know multiple types of operands in Python like assignment sorry the first arithmetic operators then relational or you can say comparison operator logical operator assignment Operator bitwise Operator and some you know special operators are there like identity operator membership operator so all these operators will be discussing one by one in this video we'll be talking about more arithmetic operators okay let's discuss so these are different type of operators arithmetic relational or comparison logical bitwise assignment identity and membership so this video we'll be discussing more about arithmetic operators I hope you know like in arithmetic we have plus so no need to explain like pluses for what addition obviously then minus subtraction then this is what star or you can say this is for multiplication this is for division okay and this is for modulus modulus means it will give remainder okay like five mode two means the remain if you divide 5 by 2 the remainder would be one so it will give one remainder now one thing in Python if I write 5 divided by 2 you are using python three point something 3.10 like three point X version we are using so here if you write down this thing if you print this it will give you 2.5 float number it will give you in Python three point x this divisor will also will always give you a float number floating Point number if I write something like this 2 divided by 2 for I would say 4 divided by 2 so this 2 divide this 4 cleanly it would be 2 but the answer would be 2.0 a floating Point number always in three point x in three point X version now if you wanna get integer value I want to get only 2 because it divides cleanly okay so you can use flow division one more operator is there lower division is you can represent that thing with 2 slash this is flow division so if I write here floor division two now it will give me 2. okay this is flow division next is power see Power is one means 2 raised to power 3. it's like eight four raised to the power 2 it will give 4 into 2 that is 16 okay now power here how we to you can calculate using an operator's power for power there is an operator double star so you you can write simply like print two double star three simple it will give eight four double star two it will give sixteen so this is what power okay I'll show you practically also we'll see you know the examples on our laptop but I hope you got this thing now if in one expression we have more than one operator like one expression I have there are two more concept when it comes to operator I hope you know you have heard this thing precedence and associativity so see suppose if I write something like this 5 plus 2 into 3. so here we have two operators into and plus so which one you will evaluate first if I evaluate 5 plus 2 first means 5 plus 2 is 7 into 3 it will give you twenty one second way is what evaluate this first means 5 plus 6 it will give you 11 so which is right obviously this is right we know some rules are there like board Mass rule which one to evaluate first so here also we have precedence of The Operators now this pin 2 multiplication is having higher precedence precedence Than This plus so what is that precedence chart for these arithmetic operators I am telling only arithmetic operators first obviously first would be parenthesis okay then there is power or you can say exponent this operator exponent then we have you can say like we have multiplication division flow Division and mode then plus and minus plus and minus are having least precedence I'm talking about only arithmetic operators not about all other operators in this video right now so this is the president of the arithmetic operators you can say we can write down here temtas parenthesis first exponent then multiplication division at the same you know level we have then addition subtraction at the same level we have okay now one expression is something like this this is the expression now so here we have okay plus minus are having less precedence than in 2 and this division okay but this multiplication and divide are having same precedence so which one you will evaluate first now so this confusion would be solved with the help of One More Concept that that is associativity when more than one operators are there of same precedence then associativity comes into picture now for this associativity is what for these operators associativity is left to right for plus and minus also left to right for this it is right to left for exponent of for power it is right to left okay for these left to right means you will move from left to right and whichever operator comes first we will solve that first so okay rather than plus and minus first we will solve multiplication and division because these are having higher precedence but which one from these two move left to right multiplication comes first so this should be solved first three into two that is 6. then this 5. this would be a 10 divided by 5 could be 2.0 because this is a division of flow division like this then only plus and minus are remaining so same left to right associativity move left to right then this 5 plus 6 this would be solved first that is 11 then here I have minus 1 plus we have 2.0 then this minus will be solved first that is 10 10 plus 2.0 and the answer would be 12 point zero like this these are very simple I guess arithmetic operators only the different and the more two new operators are flow Division and exponent okay so you have to okay you have to change you have to change some this expression I don't know how you will change but the answer I want it should give 11.0 maybe you can add like in case you can add a parenthesis because parentheses are having higher precedence if you add somewhere parenthesis then that would be executed first but you have to add some parenthesis here maybe one or two I don't know but the answer should be 11.0 let's try it so I guess that's it for arithmetic operators let me just show you these operators on my laptop so let's create a new file right click on this then new then file and name I'm writing arithmetic operators arithmetic underscore operators.py Okay so simply like if I want to print 5 plus 2 then simply you can just write down this thing into print okay and you can just right click and run this and it will give you seven okay so I guess these are simple plus minus and all let me just show you this divide thing okay division so it will give you 2.5 if I write here rather than 5 I'm writing 4 here and now let me just run this and it will give you 2.0 it is dividing it cleanly it should give two but it is in 2.0 so if you want that integer part only not floating Point number just use flow division okay double the slash it will give you two this is slow division okay now power what about power C if I write star star 2 then it will give you 16. okay if I write here uh star like uh 2 raised to power 3 I want to do it will give you eight two raised to power 3 it will give you 8 so this is what exponent or power okay now what are other operators modulo operator we can write something like this like five and this mode 2. 5 mode 2 the remainder would be what one so it will give you one it will give remainder fine and the expression we have discussed let me just write down that expression here see this was the expression let me just run this and it will give you what 12.0 okay in this expression it has applied that president said associativity rule okay that we have discussed so these I think arithmetic operators are very simple or rather than this directly writing this you can what you can do what you can just take a variable like a is equal to 5 and b equal to I am taking 2. and rather than this you can write down print a divided by B this is also fine on the variables a divided by B will give you 2.5 this is division or flow division okay so now one assignment for you is you have to calculate BMI BMI body mass index so what is the formula for that weight divide by BMI weight divide by height cos Square height Square height power 2. that is the thing like height I am writing your height into height this thing but this is simply you cannot write down this because because of associativity this divide would be executed first so you have to put this height into height into parenthesis height into height means height keep you high you don't have to use height into height you have to use power operator exponent operator okay so this is the formula weight in kg you have to take in from the user enter your weight in kg enter your height in meters in meters ok so height in meters would be in float okay so wait you can take an INT value and height you have to take float so you have to take you have to use input function take input from the user enter your weight enter your height and simple hint is what maybe sometime maybe you have to do some type casting type conversion and then use the operators we have discussed till now arithmetic operators and you just you can calculate this thing if you are not getting this point this you know exercise you can let me know in comment section maybe we can discuss the solution in next video okay so you have to calculate the BMI body mass index so in the next video we will see a relational operators or comparison operators in Python so now it's in the next video till then bye bye take care
