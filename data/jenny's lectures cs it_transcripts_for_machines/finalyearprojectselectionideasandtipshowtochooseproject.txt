in the previous video we have discussed some project selection tips for beginners right but now in this video I'm going to discuss how to choose a project and some tips for final year students and you can say as well as for pre finally as students right because as we know now yarn you are in final year and you are now going to sit into the placements and your projects are going to play very important role in your placements because you are a fresher and you don't have any experience so what you have to showcase in your resumes your internships any certification and mainly the projects right so your projects you know should be something very new or you can say something very innovative and great something which is and you know it's an eyecatcher for the interviewer right so now I assume that at this point of time if you are in final year then at least you have worked on four to five projects at least right and if you haven't done this thing then this is your biggest mistake right now I assume that if you haven't then if you haven't worked on any project till final year and it's a first project and still if you are in pre final year and if it is your first project then definitely you know you have gained only the theoretical knowledge you have learned the programming language is only to pass out the subjects you haven't gained any exposure any practical exposure and that thing is very important because see now you are in college so I think marks doesn't matter so much your knowledge and skills method right marks I know I am NOT saying that you obviously you have to gain that cutoff marks 65% 70% marks to sit in the placements but it's not like that 94% marks or 95% marks right I hope you are getting my point so you have to you know focus on your skills your knowledge your practical exposure and all these kind of things right so now how to choose the project if you are in final year so I that now obviously you are in finally here you have worked on four to five projects and now you know your area of interest right in which area you want to go so first point is now it's time to beep dive into your area of interest so now here you need you are not supposed to select any simple project you have to do some research some surveys and you have to deep dive into your area of interest right your project should be something very innovative very big and something new right so maybe some common areas or what you can say Android development app development iOS app or game development or website these kind of things right but if you want if you are not going to you know choose a project from this area and you want something different so the trending areas or what you can select cloud computing artificial intelligence blockchain that is very trending nowadays right and cryptography is also good and you can say a women today allottee is also good so you can select any area from this thing right so these are some areas and as well as and machine learning is also in training nowadays so you can select any area now now you have selected the area suppose you have no experience about this area but you want to work you want to do any project in this area right so now your very important point is what generally student ignore these kind of at this point especially you have to choose your guide carefully and your team member also now you know your classmates better and you know who can help you in this kind of project who is good in this area plus your mentor or your guide so now you are in final year or maybe in free pre final year so now you have the idea that which faculty you know as expertise in which area right maybe someone who is teaching cloud computing for cloud computing you can contact to that faculty right or maybe someone some faculty or still pursuing its you know his or her PhD in a particular area so that would be I think to beneficial for you to select those you know faculties as your guide because now they're pursuing their PhD so they are reading many research paper actually right to find out their problem statement or maybe they have found out their problem statements so they can easily help you to find out your problem statements for your project right so please choose your mentor carefully plus after choosing the guide second point is what you have to do regular meetings with your guide you know okay I guess you have four months to work on the project and final year right so please the problem statement the problem finding statement the first stage is very crucial for this maybe it's better to meet your with your guide regularly daily based on daily basis just to finalize your problem statement this is a very important point so it's not like that someone is strict so you are not going to choose that faculty as your guide and someone is cool so you are going to choose that faculty as they write I think you should choose a strict faculty as your guide this is my personal experience right because in that case you will be punctual and disciplined you will meet the faculty though your guide regularly and it is going to help you a lot in your four months right so please take care of this point now you have to read research paper I think the best technique to finalize your statement problem statement is what go through some research paper some recent research paper in that area means you can say from 2010 to 2010 years time span not very old research papers right we central search paper try to read try to find and try to find out the problems and try to implement those research papers maybe your guide will give you that you redress this research paper and come with your problem statement or come you know with your idea what you want to do so yeah I know it's very tough to read a research paper initially if you have read first time that definitely you are not going to get anything but as fine that is normally it happens with everybody when you will read second time third time then you will get something from that research paper fine and try to write down some points also while reading the research paper this is another you know you can say a lengthy topic how to read a research paper definitely I am going to upload a video in this topic but later fine so now I think according to me the best idea is you have to read some research paper in that area and try to implement those research papers fine maybe five or ten or research papers you read and then find out which research paper you can implement or maybe something some research paper you will get future scope right in last heading would be their future scope so in in that you know section they have identified that this is the problem in this research paper or in this research and I am going to do this thing in future so you can develop that thing also if you have got that future scope so you can implement that future scope you can take that future scope as your problem statement and make a project this is a very good idea actually but it is stuff I know it is stuff you have to devote your time fine and as well as now after the project try to publish a research paper that is definitely going to help you if specifically if after your graduation you want to do post graduation right that is definitely going to help you and in placements also in getting placements also if you are published a research paper means you have done something extra right because publishing a research paper is not so easy actually right so I have gone through this experience also maybe someday maybe in some another video I'll share that experience but that is definitely would be a plus point for you publishing a research paper on your project right and now suppose if you want if you don't want to select any this area and you want to work maybe suppose you want to build a website or you can say an app Android app so what you can do see try to learn the and frameworks there in android also everybody knows many frameworks are there so try to learn the recent frameworks and work on those frameworks and use that framework in your project this will show that yes you are a self learner you have done something to learn first of all that framework that is new framework right and after that you have done your project fine rather than just you know taking the common frameworks what everybody is using plus second point is what suppose one student has done in its application his application in Java and analyst another student has used quote link right so definitely quatrain is not in your syllabus and joy wise yeah it is very popular language but it is common language right and it is your curriculum also now definitely I would prefer I would be more interested in that project the student who have worked in Cote Ling because I know that courtliness it's not very easy to learn first of all he or she has learned that language he or she has put his efforts her or her efforts in learning that language and that then used that language in your in his or her project right so try to do these kind of things also or another thing what you can do you can you can merge like if you are developing any app so there you can merge cryptography also encryption and decryption some cryptographic algorithm you can merge two areas and develop something new or in Android you can merge something you know machine learning model right that is also fine so that is also something new right same for web development also you can work on any recent frameworks like react or angular angularjs and these kind of frameworks are very popular nowadays right so you can walk these on these kind of frameworks for your frontend and for back and I I guess nowadays in trending are Django and spring as far as I know some other technologies also there which is in trending so you can comment you can do the comment in the comment box so that so that other can also get some ideas about the trending topics right so the main motto is what you have to search for the trending topics right in your area of interest and next thing is what in your project you should you know implement many functionalities it's not like that your your project is just doing two or three things right so that is also very simple project you have to incorporate many functionalities in your project that first of all this then this it will do this thing then it will load this thing means at least maybe you can say 10 or 15 functionalities right so that is also a good project because see ultimately your project should show your capabilities your skills your aspirations to the interviewer because he or she is very experienced person and by looking at your project and when you explain that project he or she can analyze you that you have devoted this much as this much of time to your project and you have gained what you have gained from that project so definitely a good project is what you have devoted your time at least three to four months in that project and you have gained something from that project something new right you have gained some knowledge from that project it's not any traditional project like management type of projects this is also very important please don't choose the traditional type of projects and if you are choosing then it must have something extraordinary in that project you can just survey the website or the management type of project you are doing about that and you can you know research about that that what extra thing you can do you can add in that website which is very you know eye catcher for the interviewer which will add something which will add something to your project or something your resume right and next step is what I think your project you know should have visualization and it should be interactive right like I have gone through a video there I have you know he has developed a project path finding algorithm means on a map you will select two points source point and destination destination points and suppose you have put some hurdling that you have draw a line this is the hurdle right and he has implemented five to six path finding algorithm Dijkstra bellmanford and these kind of algorithms and when you select that algorithm then it will you you know it will show the working of that algorithm like a dice trial ever them you select it will show the working properly on the map that how he is going to find the path and finally when he has fine find out the part that algorithm then a line would be drawn like this that this is the shortest path from this to this right so this is also you know good factor if you can add some visualization to your project and it should be directive also so in brief if you ask me some tips for project selection for finally a students or prefinal your students just to go for the trending topics right plus use recent technologies recent frameworks new languages in your project right and please choose your mentor carefully these are very important points your project should show that you have worked hard on your project you have devoted time on your project and you have gained something new from that project you have enhanced your knowledge and skills after working on that project right don't go for the traditional and simple project please in final year and try to publish a research paper at least one research paper in International Journal or any conference on your project right so that's it for this video now I'm going to see you in the next video till then byebye take care
