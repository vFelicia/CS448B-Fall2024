so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing data types in c plus plus in the previous video we have discussed into data type so now the next data type is float these are uh built in data type or you can say primitive data type so you can say fundamental data type so in this video we'll talk about flow data type float double long double long is water data data type or you can say data modifier that we can use with the double we cannot use with any we cannot use any data modifier with float as we have discussed data modifiers are four signed and signed a short and long no data modifier can be used with float only we can use with double that is we can use long with double long double so these three we will discuss in this video float double and long double the range you can say the size how you can use this in your program everything we are going to discuss the precision the deserts significant digits right some interesting facts also i'll show you or you can say i'll tell you in this video about these things with the help of a program we will discuss these things right but before that just want to ask you one thing you all have summer breaks then how we are going to utilize your summer breaks and if you don't have then definitely you have weekend after a long working week right yeah taking a break is important but holding on to every opportunity that helps you become better is more important so that is why i have something interesting for you guys to do during this free time during this break and upskill yourself geeks four weeks is organizing a summer break challenge for the coming weeks they are hosting data structure and algorithm contest the dsa contest for a few weeks and these contests would be on every saturday 7 to 9 00 pm till 31st of july there will be nine contests of data structure and algorithm so participating in these contests will give you a boost in your confidence and definitely it will enhance your skill set of dsa which is one of the critical skill to get into the world of geeks apart from this the winners will also get some prizes the first prize the first position will get smart watch pens stickers and mentorship sessions on social media second position will get lenovo tablet pens and stickers and third we'll get earbuds pens and stickers so get ready to ace your game at dsa every saturday with geeks4gigs and see this event is invite only so if you want to participate in this contest you should contact to your campus mantri and if you don't have any campus monthly in your college or if you are working then you can use my code to enter so all the relevant details and the link the participation link i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is a float data type ok the size is 4 bytes float means it is used to represent the decimal numbers single precision decimal numbers floating point numbers like 3.14 we have float ah this is decimal so this is float and see the floating point number would always be ended with the f right otherwise if you write this thing how we will write this data type float then variable name suppose i am taking f or not f suppose i am taking x is equal to one point if you write down something like this then by default your this would be understood like it is double double number flow double and long double we have right so automatically compiler will convert it into float the automatic type conversion that we'll see later in the video but there is a concept of automatic time type conversion that would be converted into float and that after that it would be stored in this one so better write f at the end just to clarify that it is float right one thing this you need to take care we generally don't you know write this f we don't care but we should write this f to represent that it is a floating point number so how many bytes it would consider sorry how many digits would be considered as significant digits in flow up to seven digits like if i want to print this thing one two three point five six seven eight nine f and if you print something like this c out and f right sorry x definitely you use std colon colon or using name space std uh so it will print by default how many digits seven digits significant digits right so one two three one two three four five six seven these many digits so means it will print only this number one two three point five six seven eight seven digits are there right or more precisely if i say then if you print something like this then c out this c out will print only six digits in gw compiler automatically the precision of the c out is only six digits so it will print only six digits like one two three point five six seven right only this one you can set this precision like if you want to print more ah digits like a number is very like 0 1 5 0 7 8 9 this one and i want to print number something like this right so c out will print only six digits but you can set the precision of the c out and if you set like c out set precision p r e c i s i s i o n and i right here 10 then it will print up to how many digits 10 right so what it will print one two three point five six seven eight nine zero up to one it will print or it will round off this one would be two something like this because after that its five right but this float is having seven digits of precision only right so till seven digits if you are taking this float still seven digits it will print correct value like up to this one up to this up to 8 it will print correct value after that it may print some garbage value right because the precision of this float is what only up to seven digits so now i if you want to print a large number correctly suppose up to ten precision or up to thirteen percent up to fifteen precision correctly i want to print may be some scientific calculation we need large number so then we do not take float we take double it will take 8 bytes and it print up to 15 digits precision digits are up to 15 it is that is why it is known as float is known as single precision floating point number it is used to open single precision floating point number and it is for double so now if i take like double x rather than float if i take here double x okay if you write float here then better to write f at the last right i forgot this thing in double we don't write anything now for double if you don't write this set precision value and you write only these two lines c out x then what it will print so you need to take care of this thing the c out the default precision for c out is only six digit in gw compiler that we are using generally right so it will print only six digit one two three five six seven that's it but i want to print up to ten precision so just write down set the precision by default like manually you can set ten now it will print up to ten like nine 0 2 correctly correctly why correctly because now it is double right and the double can print up to 15 digits precision up to 15 digits right so if we write here 15 then what it will print 9 okay this complete number is having digit only 15 digits so it will print the complete number if it is having like 0 1 2 16 17 18 digits right so it will print up to 15 digits only up to 9 right and if you set precision like something like this 17 or 18 then it will print the up to 18 digits right but up to 15 it will print the correct value and after that three three digits would be any garbage value because because the precision for double edge only 15 digits right so if more digits you want to print precisely then you can take long double long double is taking 12 bytes and the present digits for this is 18 digits so it will print 18 digits up to 18 digits precisely the number right after that if you take the precision like the number is having 1 2 3 4 this one total i guess 21 digits are there so if you want to print if you want to print 21 bits so up to 18 digits it will print correct value after that it will pin some garbage value right so i hope and see if you are taking this number long double long double x at the last better to write l either small l or capital l just to indicate that this number is double in case of float just write f just to indicate that it is float number capital f 4 small f but if you are taking double then it's okay because by default the number would be considered as double by the compiler right i hope you go to these points some more points if i specify then how you can find out like the the precision for the c out is 6 that i will show you practically right not here and these numbers these you know data types are used to store decimal numbers and exponential number also in e form i guess you have some idea like let us take an example of exponential number if i have 1.2 0 e plus 4 this is exponential number this would be written as 1.20 into 10 raised to power 4 if you have minus 4 then 10 raised to power minus 4 right so if a large number is there that scientifically would be represented in exponential form see internally this floating numbers are stored in the system completely different from the int number how in number are stored right but you don't have to go into deep like how to represent this float floating point number because they have some scaling factor and all see if you take this number like 3.1456 so this number or 34.567 this number so the scaling factor for this says c it would be 0.3456 and scaling factor would be 100 right same you if you take this number something like this seven eight nine then this number would be zero point three four five six a seven seven eight nine and scaling factor would be something like this so see you do not have to go into this thing because internally they represent this number in binary form and the scaling factor would be in binary number also it is like the base in decimal right like 10 a super 5 10 raised to power 2 scaling factor would be 10 raised to power 2 10 raised to power 5 but in binary that would be in the form of 2 base would be 2 so this you don't need to take care like you don't have to go into this much detail how they are going to represent if you want to go in this detail then you can tell me in comment box we can just upload a separate video like how the floating point numbers are to be stored internally right but for the data types for the sake of data types you just need to know these fix and the range for this float and double would be so you can see the range because the number is very large so they have written in exponential form that i have told you you can write down capital e or small e that's same thing so for float is it is minus 3.4 e plus 38 to plus 3.4 e plus 38 and for double it's 1.7 e plus 308 to 1.7 e plus 308 now how you can represent this number into this you can just check out that i have told you you don't have to remember the range actually right but all the points you have to remember these things so let me just show you practically like these things so this is a program we have just taken three variables float double and long double right this header io stream in main we have float f4 rather than f i should write suppose i am writing x this number is float at the end i am writing f then double a this number is double then long number and last we are writing l right and simply we are printing simply we are printing like a you want to print so i should remove this command c out a we are printing a is double so let me just write down just to clear out let this is double double a the value we are printing then a is long double long double a and this is float x right so we are printing the values it's not f it's x we are not taking any precision value because these are all commented outlines right after that we will set some precision value this line like numeric limit this and no meaning also i will tell you but for now return 0 and that's it right so now if you run this program then what output you will get c for double a nine point one two three four six for this long double a triple nine point one two three four float a three four five six point one two so the main point here what you need to note is every number is having six digits only six digits i'm not saying after decimal six this you need to take care only six including the previous one which is before decimal also total deserts are six so c out is allowed to print only six deserts precision of c out is six digits only by default so double long double float it doesn't you know tense like it is double or long double or float see out only print six digits right now you can set precision value so if you want to set like let me just increase the size and here i want to set the precise value like set precision 10 but see it is what saying set reason is undefined because this is not in this header file which header file you need to include which header you need to include for this i o manage this header you need to include right in this header we have this function set precision right now it will not give any error right so and see one more thing i want to show you let me just remove this header file and we are writing c out set p r e c i see it is not giving any option to us right like auto fill options and if i include this header file include io manip this header and if now i want to write p r e s i c now it is giving you these options like you can just select this because this is in this header file i o menu so whatever is this header file now we can use those thing those methods classes objects functions in this program right so just click on this now i am setting this value 7 okay let's say 7 so all these things would be printed up to 7 digits see now this double is also having now seven digits up to seven digits the long uh double is also seven digits and float is also three four five six point one to three seven digits if i set this one to 9 we just show you the difference exactly let me just comment out this double and long double first and let me just clear the previous output now up to nine digits you want to print and let me just run this now see float value is three four five six point one two four one two it's one two three in float but one to four it is printing because after three we have nine so it would round off right so by default uh the floating precision i have told you is seven digits right so till seven digits it will print correct after that it will give some garbage value still seven like one two three it should be three but it is rounding off like it is 4 because of the 9 if suppose i change this 9 to 0 or 2 1 then let me just show you the output see now 1 2 3 1 2 3 then it is printing zero five but after one two three we have one zero and it is printing zero five any garbage value because the precision digits for float is only seven digits right but if now float is clear to you let us take double and long double right let me just run this they will print up to nine digits correctly you can see here last number it it should be in double it should be eight and it is rounding off because after that we have five we have does it greater than five or five then it will increase one so if i set the precision uh 15 right and the number i am taking like 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 right and long double also i am taking so now it will print see 15 precision up to it will print double a so long double we don't have any no problem because the present digits are 18 so in double we have 15 so till 15 it is printing exact same one two three 4 not 4 that is 5 because of rounding off but if i take this value 17 now let me just run this now you see the double value one two three four one two three four okay after that it will printing six one one two three four but it should print five six but it is printing six one right because up to 15 degrees it will print precise value after that any garbage value so same you can take you know set the precision like 18 digits so long double will print up to 18 digits you know correct value if you set the precision 20 then those last two does it would be any garbage value right but if you you can set the places in individual for float separate for c long double separate for double separate in c out in this statement you can write down this like c out for double you can first of all set precision digits like you know for double its up to 15 so up to 15 you can write down the digits for long double separate for float separate so this is for your assignment you have to take three these float numbers float double long double and you have to set the precision digits for ah float double and long double different for each not same here i am setting same for each this data type but you have to set different for each data type in separate say out statement you just said you can write down this function that's very easy i can i guess you can do this right so just try out these things i hope now this is clear to you if you want to find out the default precision for c out then what you can write down here if you are writing c out c out see outdoor precision you need to write down let me just save it and run see it is printing before double it is printing six i hope you can see this thing see before double it is printing the digit six so it is for this one the default precision four c out is six digits only as i have told you this is how you can right now if you want to find out the limit then see you can write down this thing let me just comment out these things right numeric limit if you want to find out numeric limit for float and these numbers so you have to first include this header l i m i t limits right battery down laptop the limits you have to write down and after that you can write down this line numeric limit then which data type limit you want to find out and double colon digits 10. so it is for decimal digit 10 is for decimal now let me just run this and show you what output it is giving okay see it is not printing anything see because after return 0 we have this line c out and return 0 means successfully we have exit did from this program right so it is not taking this line into consideration this is the thing so before return 0 we have to paste it right now let me just show you for float it is six see the limit six roughly we say you know six seven or sometimes it's eight right roughly we say up to 7 digits precision value is there if you want to find out for like double then let me just run this for double it's right if you want to find out for long double then it would be 18 c 18. so this is how you can find out the limit or you can say the precision for these things or many functions are there like maximum deserts minimum deserts you can find out this thing also you just explore these things you can just press ctrl and click to this limit and you can just read out what this limit is all about right so this documentation this type of thing you need to read out if you have time like you know if you want to know more detail like how these are stored what is the scene this header and all and you have time then the better to explore these things also right it's not like that i can tell you everything here and if you find out anything any problem then you can ask me in comment box you can just send us you know and send a screenshot and you can just ask me on my instagram account or on my this comment comment section so i hope flow data is clear to you now the next video will see cad air types and i'll see the next video till then bye
