are a beginner or your XP you are a you know an experienced person according to me if you ask me the best book then you can say the Bible of this data structure algorithm basically specifically for algorithm is for men but I guess a beginner cannot read that that is very tough you need a you know some measurement mathematical big ground you need for that and you must have some patience and time because that is very young people but if you are a beginner then also Sean C is a good book and the one more book is data structure to see by similar to topic that is the good food right or you can go for Suraj sapne as well right Mohit I'll get what motivated you to start you two lectures see this I just feel to spread the knowledge I have as much as I can right that's why I am stopping you do you

YouTube interaction video I guess how about master in data structure see here to master in anything you need to start from b6 right start from basics read out each and every concept in detail implement those concepts it's not like that you read out that concept and copy program for that concept from someone someone else and yeah it's done try to implement your own logic right practice as much as you can that is the only way that you can good in any subject not in data structure in any subject right start from the basics read out the topic thoroughly and I recommend you to read from books standards good books in first you know if you are not getting during the first few read of it second time third time still you're not getting you can go for up you know some of the videos you
