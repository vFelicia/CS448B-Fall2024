in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing about what printing pattern programs and see how to print these kind of patterns we already discussed three printing pattern programs so now in this video i'll talk about how to print this pattern first of all we'll see the logic on this whiteboard then i'll show you the output on my laptop using base code editor right please check out the previous videos first then you will get it better so now here i am taking number of rows 5 but we'll also discuss if user wants to enter number of rows 5 10 15 20 then how you will uh run this that code so here number of rows five right two loops would be required first is for these number of lines or you can say number of rows like first loop is we will take variable i so when i is 1 for this row i am just you know for a better understanding i am just writing down like this c number of rows i is 1 for this row then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 right and for these columns we have one variable that is j which is responsible which is for inner loop and which is responsible for actual printing j is equal to 1 here 2 3 4 and 5 like this right i hope you got it why i'm writing like this so now in the previous patterns we we are printing we are printing only this s trick or you can say star right but here in this one we have to print two things space as well as star it's not like that here also you can print star first of all we have to print space like in this line first of all four space then star in second line three space two star in third line two space three star like this we are printing and in the last line all the lines we are printing what star no space plus slash and three things you have to put in this program space the star plus slash and for new line i have five line right so now slash and we are putting an outer loop in inner loop what you have to put some condition right when you want to print space when you want to print star so in inner loop we have to put some condition now you have to think about that condition this is main thing in these printing pattern programs if you are able to figure out what condition you put that's it right the control is in your head after that so how to find out that condition see now think about it for this space for this location or you can say cell high value is 1 j value is also 1 for this i value is 1 j value is 2 for this 1 1 for this high value is 1 j value is 3 like this 1 and 4 for this i value is 2 j value is 1 for this it's 2 2 for this it's 2 3 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 2 4 3 like this it's 5 1 5 2 5 3 in these locations you have to print space otherwise star so what condition we can put c please think about it if i put like this i plus j less than equal to 5 in that case print space otherwise print start see now why i am saying this i plus j for this cell i plus j is what i is 1 j is 1 so 1 plus 1 that is 2 2 less than equal to 5 number of rows are 5 total number of rows 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition trim print space 2 plus 1 3 3 is less than equal to 5 yes print space 3 plus 1 4 4 is less than equal to five yes print space four plus one five five less than equal to five yes five is equal to five print space now for this cell value is what i value is one j value is five one plus five that is six is this condition true six less than equal to five no now print star let's check this condition is true or not for the second row two plus one three condition true print space two plus two four condition two print space three plus two five five less than equal to five condition true print space 2 plus 4 that is 6 condition not true print star 2 plus 5 7 condition not true print star i hope you are getting my point so we can generalize this would be the condition generally we can put this condition here i have 5 rows that is why i am writing here 5 if you want dynamically want to enter number of rows if you want to take a variable rows like 10 rows i want to print so what you can do i plus 1 less than equal to rows this i will show you when we will see the output on my laptop right so i hope you got it how to find out this condition maybe you are still confused like ha ha ma'am you can write how we are able to think i plus j less than equal to number of rows this would be the condition it's okay if you are a beginner in these kind of programs it's okay you have to practice ultimately when you will practice five or ten programs you will get after you will get like you will get what what kind of condition we can put here right automatically logic will click in your mind maybe if it's your second program third program or first program you are not able to you aren't able to think the logic like why i am putting i plus a less than equal to phi but you have to think over it this will come with practice only right you have to practice lots of printing pattern programs see now let me write down the logic i'm just writing down the main logic i'm not writing down the complete program so first of all the outer loop i'll i is equal to 1 i less than equal to 5 and i plus plus here 5 this is for to printing number of rows or number of lines 1 to 5 lines so that is why i less than equal to 5 right 10 lines 5 less than equal to 10 or dynamically if you want to take the input let me write down that thing also suppose i want that user should enter at the right time number of rows so you can ask enter number of rows from the user and you can take this input using scan percentage d and variable name i am taking suppose rows three variables you have to decide you have to declare first i j and rows so now here simply you can write down i less than equal to number of rows or you can start this two with zero also it's up to you if you start with 0 i i is equal to 0 i less than rows you can change this condition so you can do this modification at your own i'm just know here to explain the logic here now inner loop j is equal to 1 i am starting with 1 j less than equal to 1 number of rows right because see this is for outer within this i j should be repeated five times four times it should print space next time star in every row j should be repeated five times five times means number of rows time that is why i am writing here the same condition less than equal to number of rows right and now what j plus plus now you have to put some condition here what if i plus j less than equal to what number of rows then simply print space else what you have to print if this condition is not true print star in inner loop you will get this thing right and now after this in outer loop what you will print because after each line next line for next line we have to put slash n in outer loop and that's it now let me run this first at first see i value is 1 1 is less than equal to row suppose user is entering number of rows 5 number of rows i have entered 5 so i less than equal to number of rows condition true we are going to enter here now here j is equal to one j is equal to one one is also less than equal to five number of rows are five one less than equal to five yes condition true enter into the slope now see if i plus j now i value is 1 j value is 1 2 i plus j 2 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition true print space now space will be printed obviously i cannot print no space here so just let me do four space this underscore this is space space should be printed right space should be printed this condition true no else block would be executed now again j plus plus j is now 2 condition true 2 is less than equal to 5 yes again enter here i plus j now 2 plus 1 3 3 less than equal to number of rows 5 condition true again print space j plus plus 3 right now 3 less than equal to number of rows yes condition 2 i plus j 3 plus 1 is 4 4 less than equal to 5 yes condition true print space j plus plus that is 4 condition 4 less than equal to number of rows yes condition true again enter here i plus j 4 plus 1 5 5 less than equal to 5 yes 5 is equal to 5 condition still true print space now j plus plus that is 5 now 5 is less than equal to number of rows yes condition true enter again now i plus j five plus one is six now six less than equal to number of rows number of rows are five no condition is not true now we are not going to enter into if loop we are going to enter into else block now print star now print stuff right now j plus plus now j becomes 6 is 6 less than equal to rows rows are 5 condition is not true now out of this 4 loop after this for loop what we have written slash n slash n means cursor would be in this line now right no printing cursor would be in this line now i plus plus now i becomes 2 who is less than equal to number of rows yes condition true we are going to enter here now again j would be initialized with 1 again j is 1 same process would be repeated again then for 3 then 4 then 4 5 right when i becomes 6 this condition is also not true 6 less than equal to rows rows are 5 this condition not true we are going to exit from the loop i hope you got the working of this loop right now to explain proper no the complete working i hope you got it now let me show you the output on my laptop see now let me show you the output on my vs code let me create a one more file pattern let me name it pattern four dot c header file main function that is very important it's like a driver for this program i and j for two loops variables and one as number of rows fine we are going to take input from the user how many rows a user want right so enter number of rows fine we will take input using what's scanf percentage d address of the name of the variable is rows now outer loop i is equal to i'm going to start this loop from 1 you can start it with 0 up it's up to you according to that you can change the condition right i'm going to start from 1 i now what less than equal to rows and i plus plus right now inner loop is responsible for printing so j is equal to 1 and semicolon now j less than equal to same number of rows and j plus plus now in this we are going to put some condition suppose you have to print space or star if condition is i plus j right i plus j is less than equal to rows then what you will print printf just space right otherwise else what would be printed printf star i'm not putting any curly braces any finesse because i am using only one statement so no need to put curly braces i hope you got it because i already discussed when you were discussing it fails so now uh yeah one more thing you have to print in outer loop what slashing now slasher and that's it now we have to run this program let me run this and it will ask from the user enter number of rows 5 or 10 whatever number of rows you want you can enter see enter number of rows 5 i'm entering and see the output again let me run it for 10 number of rows now here this time i'm entering 10 number of rows and see the output right again suppose you want to run and uh for 20 see the output for 20 rows i hope you got it right now i hope you got how to print this pattern if you are not getting how to figure out this condition it's okay we will do more printing pattern programs and with practice ultimately you will get what kind of condition we can put to print that kind of pattern right so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
