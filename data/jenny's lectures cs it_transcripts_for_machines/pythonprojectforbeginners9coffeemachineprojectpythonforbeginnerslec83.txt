hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of cloning Python programming language in the previous video we have implemented a game that was a higher lower game right I hope you have done that project now in this video we'll be working on one more project and that is what we are going to make a coffee machine it's a virtual coffee machine right now first of all the project is you have to make a copy machine now first task is what you have to understand the requirement you have to understand the working of that coffee machine if you have seen if you are working or anywhere in office or anywhere if you have seen that coffee coffee machine then how it works obviously there are multiple kind of coffee machines so generally what a coffee machine do that thing right so maybe like it will ask you the option which which type of coffee you want like maybe latte espresso or cappuccino right you will give your choice then according to that it will prepare like if resources are available then only it will give you the coffee you will insert second thing you will insert coin the coffee machine we assume that this coffee machine the virtual coffee machine we are going to make is accepting only coins five rupees 10 rupees and 20 rupees coin right now you have to insert the coin it will calculate if you have provided enough money or not right and if you have inserted too much money then it will give you change and if you have inserted less money then it will give you like it will give you a it will print a message like that's not enough money and money your money would be refunded this kind of thing I think is understand just go on Google and understand the requirement of coffee machine right maybe my requirements are different from your requirements that is okay right so understand the requirement write down all the requirement on a piece of paper divide the complete task the complete copy machine project into different different tasks small small tasks and then complete one one task small task right and then ultimately you will get your project right okay now let me show you what the requirements I have written what I want in my virtual coffee machine see so if you run your project then let me just show you the output what kind of output you will get it will ask what would you like to have latte espresso cappuccino we have only three options we have given only three options right toward this virtual coffee machine so just I'm entering latte so it will ask please insert coin how many five rupees coin suppose uh five how many 10 Rupees going five how many 20 rupees points suppose again five so here is your rupees 25 in change means you haven't started too much money the cost of coffee is not that much and here is your latte right now again it will serve it will ask to the next customer it will serve to the next customer like what would you like to have and suppose if this time I enter cappuccino then see it will it will show you sorry there is not enough milk so if resources are not enough then it will show this kind of message and then again you'll ask what would you like to have right again if I ask for espresso so yeah there are sufficient resources available in that coffee machine to make espresso coffee so it will ask please insert coin again maybe I am entering like I don't know how much money is this you have to calculate the total and it will give you 165 rupees and change because you have inserted too much money and here is your espresso right and if I insert this report if I report then it will generate a report and it will show me how much water is left how much milk is left how much coffee is left in our machine coffee machine and the money the profit because we have stored to two customer so we have like received money from two customers the payment so it will add that money here like it is asking in the machine I am having right now 250 rupees right now again if you'll ask what would you like to have so if I enter o then it will turn off the machine and just exit from here right so this is the simple one so for this thing what you need to have first the database the resources because obviously in coffee machine we insert some water or the coffee beans right and maybe milk so according to your requirement latte espresso cappuccino according to that it will fetch milk water and coffee from the machine only and it will prepare the coffee and it will add and what it will do obviously from the resources available in the machine that resources for your selected rank would be deducted right and report will show how much resources are still left right so what are the requirements if you write down the requirement then these are the requirements I have written first thing it will ask from the user for coffee time and will prompt what would you like to have from these options and see this line is should be in Loop because it is asking again and again from the user see what would you like to have what would you like to have what would you like to have right second thing when you are entering report as an input then it will show a report something like this how much water milk coffee left and how much money is there in that machine right if you enter off then your program should end the execution right now if resources are available it will first of all it will check if sufficient resources are available or not for your selected ring right if resources are available then it will ask the machine will ask please insert coin and it will calculate the total money receipt right and it will accept only five rupees 10 rupees and 20 rupees going now next step is we'll check the payment is successful or not so if user has entered sufficient money then that cost of that drink would be added to the machine as a profit right and whenever you fetch the report then it will show you that money in the machine right if user has earned too much money then it will offer you change but if user has entered less money then it will just sorry that there is not enough money and money would be refunded right now next step is if payment is successful then you have to make the coffee and what is the process like in Virtual confirmation obviously this is not the real one so I'll not give you the coffee just virtual if payment is successful then you have to make the coffee and ingredient to make that selected coffee should be deducted from the resources from that coffee machine resources right and you will print a message like here is your the name of your coffee is selected like here is your cappuccino if you have selected cappuccino right so these are some requirements right now you can pause the video again you can just write down these requirements right now one by one we will Implement these steps these requirements so first thing is this one it will ask from the user what would you like to have let's create a new file here coffee machine project dot py right so and whatever your choice I'll be will be taking a variable to fetch or to you know store that choice in a variable choice now this line should be in Loop how many time it should be repeated we don't know so if you don't know the number of iteration then best is just use while loop but what is the stopping condition see if user enter both then program should end the execution so in choice we can enter these three things or we can enter report or oh here you can also write down if you want like press o for enter off to switch off the machine and enter report to get the report that also you can write down so suppose I have a variable if the machine is on so for that I am taking a variable is on is equal to true means at first the machine is Pawn so while is on till then it will ask from the user what would you like to have this line would be repeated right but if this Choice equal to equal to if you have enter entered O then it is the right time to flip this variable and it is right time right time to switch off the machine or you can say to end the execution of our program right so this is on variable will flip this variable to false right now is one is equal to false now while a Zone false then we will be exit will be out from this while loop and we will not ask from the user what we would like to have again right but next is if like obviously we will write down Health if or if rather than else if you write like if our choice is equal to report then it should bring print something like this the current resources available now where are these resources so we have a dictionary in a program we'll be having a dictionary named the sources and their we will have these things like water and how much how many how much you need like suppose at first I'll enter 500. or rather than this I'll just write 500 integer right just assume this is what in ml right now next is milk so suppose water I have at first 500 mL milk 200 mL and coffee is 100 gram I have so in report it should print using F string will be printing like water is equal to and obviously from where you have to fetch the water this value from here 500 ml from resources from this dictionary so how to fetch the value from dictionary name of the dictionary and here we just pass the key as it is so water and we will write ml same for milk and coffee so see it is giving error can you see this red lines here so I have told you in earlier videos like if here opening and closing quotes you are writing double quotes then within this we cannot write down double quotes within this if you need a string then you have to put single quote right if here outside opening and closing are single code then Within These you have to put double quote and this ml would be here now same for milk and coffee so see like this water milk coffee and money as well it will print money as well right so water milk coffee we can fetch from the resources as it is from this dictionary right now where is money so at first we are not having any like variable so let's take a variable profit and at first it is zero because no customer came till now so at first this money is equal to from which variable from profit we can fetch and you can write down like rupees rupees and from this variable you will fetch so like this but if we have entered any specific coffee like latte espresso Capuchin then what will happen see now we should write here L if because why so we want that only one condition should be checked either if O then no other condition should be checked if report we have entered report then no other condition should be checked right after this after this after checking this condition and if choice is equal to report then only it will print this thing and whatever you will write after these line that would not be executed right else now if you have entered a coffee name then what will happen now check sufficient resources are available or not so resources we have but obviously we should have ingredient to make latte espresso and cappuccino then only we can check if we have selected latte then ingredient of latte or water this ml milk this much ml coffee this much gram then those ingredients are order ingredient we can compare with these resources ingredient and then only we can check so we should have first a database of having the ingredient of ingredient of latte espresso and cappuccine right so same suppose I have a variable menu dictionary and there first thing I am having latte right and for this ingredient water milk coffee and Coast these four things we want right so the value value again I am taking in the form of dictionary right so the key is ingredients and now value the ingredients are three water milk and coffee so again a dictionary so these are example of nested dictionaries water 200 mL milk 150 and coffee 24 gram I want right okay now obviously ingredient as well as we have another key that is Coast and Coast for latte is suppose 150 rupees right so put comma here so same this is the key is latte and the value is again in the form of dictionary ingredient then again dictionary three ingredient and then Lata is having two key ingredient and Coast so this is a first entry same for espresso and cappuccino right so here are our resources here we have the menu the dictionary name and the sources for latte espresso and cappuccino the required ingredient and cost of the coffin rupees right now we can compare if we can check like resources or sufficient resources are available or not so how to check else first you have to fetch if you have selected latte then you have to fetch the ingredient of latte because this only we have to compare water milk and coffee so fetch ingredient of your selected coffee right now this is a dictionary so how to fetch we know from the dictionary dictionary name is menu and we will give our choice whatever Choice espresso cappuccino and we will so whatever you have fetched that let's suppose we print we have taken a variable coffee tie right so let's run this and see if the last photo you like to have suppose I am I'm using latte so it will give this ingredient of latte and post because latte is a dictionary and C okay latte we have given this latte so in this dictionary we are having ingredient as well as second key value pair is cost so it will give us it will get us this thing again it is asking what would you like to have if I enter cappuccino then it will give me the cappuccino ingredient and post right now if I enter report then it will show you the resources available water milk coffee and money is still now zero obviously at first it is zero so and if I enter off then exit so till now we are fine right we have implemented first point second Point third point now you have to check sufficient resources are available or not so how you will check this thing it will create a function check resources and there what you need to pass the resources that is available globally because this dictionary is global right so what you need to pass the selected if you have selected latte then ingredient of latte right and those ingredients are in this variable coffee type see this coffee type is a dictionary don't look at this error you just have to see ingredient this latte is having this coffee type we have stored whatever it will fetch in that variable coffee time this variable coffee type so in coffee type we are having ingredient two key value per ingredient these and secondary key value pair is cost but we want only ingredient we don't want post so again you have to fetch whatever the key ingredient is the key and the value of this key this one right so what you will write here coffee time and the key is what ingredients right now it will fetch this only water milk and coffee these three values only and it will pass these three values to this function right and that's exactly we want only three values note the cost of the coffee right so let's define a function here check resources and obviously you should have a variable check resources and whatever we will have one parameter to fetch the ingredient the name is order ingredient right this is a dictionary so now compare first obviously water with water milk with milk coffee with coffee right you have to compare like this water 200 mL we need water 500 mL sufficient milk 150 ml we need milk at first 200 mL sufficient coffee to 24 gram we need coffee 100 gram sufficient right so this is how you need to check so you have to Loop through for each item right so you have to Loop through means you have to take you have to write down a for Loop four item in in order ingredient whatever you have passed so if odor ingredient see this is a dictionary order ingredient right so order ingredient and whatever the item right now this Loop is going through is greater than resources and item if this is the case then what you need to print there is not enough and whatever the item the loop is going through so we are using a string here right and then it will return false right if this is the case then return false otherwise return means yes sufficient resources are available it will return this thing so say at first in order ingredient what do we have water milk and coffee this dictionary this is again a dictionary right so this is having this value now for item in order ingredients so first item would be water so first Key Water is assigned in this item so first is water right in item I'm having water so order ingredient item is water water is greater than resources water 500 mL 200 mL is it Greater no so again we are not entering here but now next ingredient is what milk because we are still in this for Loop then milk will be assigned then milk milk would be compared and third time coffee would be assigned to the item and coffee and coffee would be compared right and this if statement is every time false so we are not going to enter in the into the safe now end of this dictionary because we have looped through this through this dictionary till the end right till coffee now it will return true means yes ingredients are available if ingredient are available then it will ask from the user please insert coins from payment right because after that only the machine is going to make coffee so I hope this definition of this function is clear to you guys right so whatever it will return we are going to maybe store in a variable or directly we can write down a four if statement if check resources this so either it will return check resources function will return true or false So based on that if it is returning first time it is returning true so if true means we can enter into this if statement right and if resources are available then see if resources are available then next task is machine should ask to insert coin and calculate the total money received from the user right so next step is this now next we will suppose we will uh we'll make a function process points right so we will not pass anything here and let's define this function here will not pass anything so no parameter would be required and first it will print please insert coin right and we will take a variable total is equal to 0. now 5 rupees point 10 rupees and 20 rupees coin only three coin the machine will accept so we are going to take a variable coins and 5 and we'll take input from the user and we'll ask like so last how many five rupees coin right and obviously that would be in integer form so please convert it first type cast this into int so same for 10 Rupees coin and 20 rupees coin right and at last just calculate total so suppose I have entered one one coin of each right so total would be how much just calculate total so 20 plus 10 30 and 35 total is 35 Total Money received so how to calculate simply this first like coins how many five number of coins that is in this variable into 5. Plus 10 into obviously 10 and plus coins 20 into 20 so this is what the total money received I hope no need to describe why I have done into 5 into 10 into 20 that's very simple right and it will just return the total now it will return here to the caller right so suppose take a variable payment is equal to process coins right now next next step is what C we have done this fifth one we have calculated the total now check payment is successful or not so you have to check if user has entered sufficient money then the cost of the drink would be added to the money to the machine resources as profit if too much money then you should offer the change if not sufficient money then just print a message sorry that's not enough money and money refunded now sixth step you need to handle so means we need to check now if the transaction or payment is successful or not so for that also let's define a function Def is payment successful and what it will have it should have to check if payment is useful or not first thing we need the money received and the cost of that coffee we need two things to compare right right the cost of the coffee and the money received what the customer has given you how much money these two things you need right so say after this let's call the function is payment successful and what argument you need to pass money received is in what in this variable payment the total in is this variable payment and the cost of the selected copy if you have selected latte then cost of latte see this thing only the cost of Landing so this complete thing we are having this coffee type in this dictionary so but but I want to access only this key value pair the cost of the coffee not the ingredient right so what you need to write here the name of the dictionary is coffee type and they are just the key name cost only the screening post passes and it will fetch the cost of the latte if you have selected latte and then it will pass and the payment is what you will receive from here here the total what user has entered right now compare if this money received is greater than or equal to the coffee cost if this is the case then what would happen see if sufficient one is there then cost of the drink would be added to the machine as profit to the machine resources as profit right so profit we have a variable profit is now zero at first profit is 0. so profit becomes profit plus equal to whatever the cost of the cost selected coffee right but one thing it will be better because profit is what a global variable right and you are trying to modify This Global variable within this function means within a local scope so that is directly you cannot do you can access but you cannot modify it so for that I have told you we have a Global keyword so just use Global profit now this line will indicate that we are referring to a variable profit that is global so now we can change this this thing we have discussed Global keyword local spoke Global scope right now we have updated the profit okay and if too much money is inserted then you have to give change now how much change you will be having that money received minus whatever the cost of the coffee just detect the cost of the coffee from the vanilla brand that is your change and then print here is your rupees whatever the changes fetch the value from here using a string in change and just return right because we are this type of function we are creating like is payment successful we need to check paymentsexual means true it should return to you payment successful not successful means it will run false right now else if sufficient money is not there then it will print message sorry there is no that's not enough money and money would be refunded and it will return false dysfunction right so where we are calling this function it will return the value where to the caller so here I am calling this function is payment successful right so now see if payment is successful payment is successful then make the copy if payment is successful then you have to make coffee right so we will either we can write down like we will fetch this thing in a variable and then we can put another if that variable is true or false according to that we can make the coffee or if directly you can write down here if and call the function so definitely it will return either true or false so if it will turn to you so if true means yeah we can enter into this if below if false then definitely we are not going to make the coffee so if this is true then make coffee so let's create a function again make coffee what you need to pass here to make coffee obviously the ingredient of that copyright now first you need to pass the coffee name what you have selected like latte so that would be in this variable Choice what would you like to have and then ingredient of your copy now the ingredient are we have accessed in this coffee type in this dictionary menu and choice see now these are the ingredient so just pass the ingredient so you have to fetch the ingredient so name of the dictionary and name of the key as it is ingredients ingredients this key this value only I want so just pass this key right no need to fetch cost right now you are calling this function then let's define this function here make coffee and here we have we should have two parameter right so first thing is suppose coffee name and let's take name order ingredient same name also you can take because somewhere else also we have taken this name powder ingredient here that's fine you can take your same name so coffee name and the what you can write down here coffee ingredient coffee ingredient now to make the coffee virtually we are making so you need to detect detect the selected drink resources from the coffee machine resources right and just print a message here is your coffee name from water water would be detected from milk milk and from coffee coffee three all the items so you have to Loop through all the items so definitely we need a for Loop for item in of ingredient because right now in coffee ingredient we are having these three things water milk and coffee if you have selected latte so just detect these think from the resources available from the resources available from this amount right so you have to do like resources and item would be minus equal to Kofi ingredient and item for that particular item right so at first if first the water would be assigned to this item then resources item is water minus equal to means resources item is equal to resources item minus of ingredient item so water for water we have 500 ml so from 500 ml how much would be deducted Kofi ingredient and item is water so coffee ingredient water is 200 mL so this would be deducted and 300 ml left right like this same for milk and same for coffee and what it should print here is your coffee name and from Google you can just search like coffee emoji and from there you can just copy paste that that emoji right and maybe you can write down enjoy like this right so this function is not returning anything we are just printing here right so we will not take any variable or anything to except the value because it is not returning anything fine so let's try to run this now see what would you like to have I will have latte so it is showing me the ingredient and everything and then please Insert Coins so I'm entering five five so here is your 25 rupees in change because ghost of the latter is 150 and here is your latte enjoy now it will ask the next customer if I first of all I want to check the report the resources available water is only 300 ml at first it was 500 milk is only 500 M left and coffee is 76 gram left only and money profit is now 150 rupees now what would you like to have suppose I enter cappuccino so ingredient of cappuccino these are the ingredients so yeah water is available 250 ml but milk is 50 ml and we need 100 ml for Cappuccino so sorry there is not enough milk so it is working fine now next if I enter espresso so only water and coffee we need and yeah we have these things right so it will ask please insert coin so I am in I'm inserting less money suppose only one one of each so that there is not that's not enough money money refunded because we need 100 rupees and these are not 100 rupees so money would be refunded again it will ask so if I enter again espresso and money I enter like five five so here is your 75 rupees in change again because 175 is total cost is hundred here's your espresso you can enjoy your coffee now again what would you like to have suppose I enter report so water is 250 ml milk 50 and coffee only 58 gram and money now is 250 rupees now I have right now turn off the machine off and exit so I know this one is little bit tough we can say or tricky because many functions and you are you are you know um there is a coffee machine and you are obviously implementing a virtual coffee machine as it is so a real world entity you have and that you are writing in the form of project right so obviously that could be a little bit tough one and here we are using functions only because if you heard about object oriented programming then to you know Implement a real world thing real world entity or real world object or real world project in this form in programming form then the best Paradigm to use is object oriented programming right so yeah we are here following the procedural approach only using functions we are doing this thing that is little bit tough but if you use that oop Paradigm then it would be a little bit easier understandable more understandable for you guys right so that's it now from the next video we'll be starting oop concept object oriented programming Concept in Python right and then using those we will be implementing the same project again so there can be many ways to implement the coffee machine or many requirement or maybe you can modify this thing you can play around with this game this code I have only three choices you can have five choices you can have one more thing like mocha and that ingredient one more ingredient you can add one more resource you can add for that you need chocolate so you add chocolate so if you got this thing then definitely you can modify your project and you can make a better project or complex one right so if you haven't got this thing it's okay you can just write down the score on a piece of paper one by one you can dry around this and just take a break and you will definitely will get it right try this out at your own if suppose you haven't tried this out at your own you are just working with me then okay don't think that I got this project now that's it no now without any help again try this out write down the complete code again without any help right then you will see how many bugs you are going to get how many times we need to check like obviously you need to copy you need to check the previous coding and all fine so that's it for this video and now I'll see the next video till then bye take care
