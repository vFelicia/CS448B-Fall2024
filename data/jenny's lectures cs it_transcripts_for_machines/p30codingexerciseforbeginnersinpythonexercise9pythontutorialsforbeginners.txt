so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen what is multiple if statement the syntax how to use those multiple if in a program with the help of a program we have seen right so now we will see in this video One coding exercise now what is this you need to write a program that is for automatic Pisa order program right so these are python pizzas now what according to the user input you need to calculate the final bill now what is the what you need to take care see small pizza price is 100 rupees for medium Pizza 200 large Visa 300 right if user want pepperoni pepperoni for small piece eyes for 30 rupees and pepperoni for medium or large pizza is 50 rupees extra cheese for any size of pizza is 20 rupees right so need to you need to ask from user what size pizza you want to order right based on that you will in that bill first of all you will add these numbers then you will ask you want to add pepperoni now based on small or medium or large pizza you need to add 30 or 50 rupees in that bill now you need to ask you want extra cheese if yes then extra 20 rupees you need to add and after that you need to process the final bill and you will the output will be your final bill is this is this so in this whatever you have learned till now multiple if if necessary fails alif these things you need to use in this program right so first it's up to you you can just draw a flowchart just to make the clear picture of the program and then you can write down the program right now think and pause the video and try out this program so I hope you have done this program now let's write down this let's create a new file and according to according to size nine so first of all what we will ask from the user size size of pizza okay we'll take a variable and using input function we will ask more medium or large now at first bill amount is zero so we'll set it to zero now put the condition if the size is equal to equal to it may be small s or capital S capital S both means small so we'll take two condition if capital S capital s or size is small s this is logical or logical operators we have discussed if this is the case then we will update the bill now Bill equal to Bill plus 100 rupees it's not final bill starting at starting below zero now we will add 100 rupees if pepperoni he or she wants to add then add some extra rupees so like Bill plus equal to 100 right or you can say Bill equal to Bill plus hundred fine or simply you can just print that the small pizza price is 100 rupees now next condition else if alif for medium size equal to equal to capital M or size Maybe small m in that case I'm just going to copy paste this now Bill plus we will add 200. will plus equal to 200 and this is medium pizza and at last else or you can write down else if L if size is equal to large then uh Bill plus 300 or simply in else you can write down Bill plus equal to 300. if you want to put them in more condition like else if size is large l or l then Bill plus this else wrong input please enter a valid size right if user enter user you know enter any other alphabet other than this as mrl then you can print that thing here simply we'll just I'm just going to you know keep it simple so that's it these three are the cases now okay Pizza size suppose I have entered small pizza now they will ask if you want to add pepperoni so obviously in the same indentation will take a variable do you want pepperoni or not right so now we'll check if this add pepperoni this variable equal to equal to Capital y or it may be small y so we'll add two thing or the sad pepperon equal to small y in both the cases but for pepperon in case of pepperoni for small pizza it is of 30 rupees for other it is of 50 rupees so again you need to check within this if nested depends so again we'll check if same this condition size size condition so I am just going to copy paste this thing if size is small then how much you need to add plus 30 Rupees to the bill so Bill plus equal to 30. right else Bill plus equal to how much 50 rupees for medium and large pizza pepperoni price is 50 rupees okay now pepperoni is done now again you know they'll ask you want extra cheese or not so same we'll take a variable extra cheese do you want extra cheese right and sorry here we have pollen so here we will check if this extra cheese this is yes so if this variable is either capital y or small y because capital I small y both means yes small y if this is true then for all size of pizza for any size of pizza you need to add 20 rupees so Bill will update the bill bill plus equal to 20. okay now we have got all the condition now simply we will print the bill okay using F string we'll print the bill right so your final bill is this so please first of all dry run this thing write down this program with your hand on a paper then dry run this with you know the inputs maybe small pizza medium or different different kind of inputs and drier in this then compile and run on your laptop now let me just run this and show you what output you will get so I want large pizza large pizza price is 300 rupees do you want pepperoni yes do you want extra cheese no so your final bill is 350 rupees 300 plus pack for pepper only 50 rupees let's run this again if I enter small pizza yes small pizza is 100 rupees do you want pepperoni no and extra cheese no thin your final bill is 100 rupees so this is just a simple program it's not just a complete we haven't you know discussed all the cases if we haven't put if you don't enter s m l then what warning it should print if you don't enter y or n if any other thing you enter like L here if I enter a then what it should give right right so we haven't discussed all the cases my motto is just to you know get you familiar with how to use this nestative else if multiple if in a single program if you want to modify this thing you want to add extra cases you can just try out right so in the next video we'll see one more coding exercise so now I'll see the next video till then bye take care
