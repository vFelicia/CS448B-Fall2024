hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning pth and programming language we have discussed oops concept inheritance polymorphism and capsulation abstraction all the four pillars of O we have discussed and the last video was about method overloading and Method overriding right so now there is one small topic but it's important one that is Magic methods in python or we can say special methods or we can say Dunder methods in Python there are some magic methods in Python so this thing we'll see in this video what are these magic methods why these are called Magic methods or Dunder methods and what is the need of these methods when we use these methods and how we are going to use these methods right so these things we'll see in this video right but in one life in one line if I say then these magic methods allows us to use some builtin operations in Python like Len St strr and many builin operations are there in Python so these methods allows us to use these builtin operations right right with our own user created objects like we create class and we create object of that class right that is our own user created object so we can use these builin operations with our own objects now what does this mean the line let me show you practically this thing okay so first let me create a new file in our python project Magic methods. py let's see first see if we take a simple example First We Take we have a list okay like one zero or any variable we can have the in this list okay sorry list one equal to like this okay now if you want to find out length of this list then we know we have an inbuilt function that is len so directly we can write down what print and there we can just call this Len and on which object you want to find out uh this length list one the object name is list one and yeah it will run see it is going us it is going to give us three right and if you print this list like if I'm going to print whatever is there in this list then simply it will print 1 0 one these are some builin you can say operations okay in operator overloading also we have seen those those builin operations like add and addition subtraction multiplication these things we have discussed right and there a little bit we have discussed about Dunder methods okay now if I have a class see suppose I have a class and I don't have anything in class just I have a class variable that is name is equal to Jenny and I'm creating object of this class okay Jenny now I want to find out length of this name so directly if I use this Len function and the object is d right object name is D and this object of this class demo and within this I have a name so I want to find out length of this name so is it correct I don't know let me just check this out let's run this and see it will give an error type error object of type demo has no Len yeah this Len is predefined or builin operation builin function builin method but we cannot use this in this class right because see on this list type of object the list object is L one so L one if I say l one dot so these are the methods on this list builin operations we can perform builtin method so see we have Len l meth method but it is having double underscore before starting of L double underscore after ending L me prefix with double underscore and suffix with double underscore okay so these kind of methods are known as special methods see Le less less than equal to LT less than mul M for multiplication so these are the methods or you can say operations builin operations which are defined on this object okay this object list one is of which type if you want to find out the type of this object then yeah we have like this we can use this type and we simply print what is the type of this list one let's run this and see class is list type or you can say class because everything in Python is an object in is also a class St Str is also a class so this the class of this list one is list list and for this class the this Len function this Len method is predefined but on our class demo we have an object D of type demo on this class there is no builin or there is no lent method Len operation or Len function defined okay so now if you want to use these builtin operations on our user defined object then use Dunder methods here special methods Dunder methods comes into picture you can use this thing with the help of Dunder method okay now we know we have that Len function Len method okay so these Dunder method short form of the of this double underscore method is Dunder method so these are prefix and suffix suffixed with two underscore right okay now we'll see how to use that special length function here on our class object next thing if we print if we simply print our object d right let's just comment this out then what it will give you see it's just giving a the name of or the address of that object at this address nothing else but if you print list then it will give the value whatever is there in this object list one okay but it is not printing anything it is not printing the name like gen okay so we are not able to use Len and even print the these buildin operations on our user defined object fine now here these gender methods comes into picture now let's see one example we have a class we have a class author and here I'm directly using the class object so you can use this thing also but see I just want to show one more dender method that is in it suffix and prefix and suffix with double ERS this is also dund method okay it is a you can say Constructor fine and it is called whenever you create an object see we don't call this init function this in it method it is implicitly called or automatically called when we create an object when this line is to be interpreted this is automatically being called so one beauty of these Dunder method is what these are not being called explicitly by you based on your actions okay these are called implicitly so that is why these are known as magic method as well because you don't need to call these methods explicitly but these are called implicitly or automatically right so that's the beauty that's the magic that is why these are known as magic method like in villages you know wife directly don't call husband especially in front of inlaws maybe you have you know faced this kind of situations or you have witnessed this kind of situation and maybe sometime we just like and he's going to understand okay so wife is calling without directly calling right that's the sign language or you can say this kind of things so these kind of method like magic method we have I hope you are able to relate this thing I don't know okay so we have so three argument we have name book name and Pages now if I want to I want to print this D then I want this information should be printed something maybe like author name or book Name by this author this kind of thing but this time you directly print D okay name demo is not defined sorry you have to create object now the class name has been changed and it's now author so simply it give you have to call you have to pass these three argument first so name I'm just calling like I'm just passing uh Jenny and so let's run this and it will simply show that object at this reference I mean the address so we have an Str Str method and that is being called when you want to return a you know string version of any object and suppose I just want to print Str Str version of D so what it will give C same this and this okay so we have a d method Str Str right that you can Define here in this class underscore uncore we have C this St Str predefined so use this Dunder method and I want to return what something like this using F string I'm writing this return statement like selft book name and then bu and what whoever the author of this book self do name this thing I want to print so whenever now you will print this print D this method is going to be executed print so it will ask to this object do you have any Str Str version of yourself and yes the object will say yes I have Str Str version of myself so it will call this Str Str method and whatever is there in this Str Str method it will print this thing now let's now this time this print D will return what C python basic to Advanced by J so this is you can say beauty of Dunder method without this is there any Str Str version of this D there is no Str Str version so simply it will print that object at this memory address that's it at this reference okay so this Str Str will return string version of any object right so whatever method we'll call this Str Str this thing would be return now and now if you execute this Len on this D then see object of type author has no Len okay it's fine we can Define we can use Dunder method we know we have builin operation Len so we have a Dunder method Len that is predefined and it should return suppose it should return like self dot Pages number of pages in my book so whenever you'll call now this Len behind the scene this Dunder method L would be called and what is it is going to return self do pages so see 300 now L is 300s so there are many Dunder method so these I'm going to tell you because these are we going to use frequently Len Str Str and one more we have like call method if you will call this object D see d as a function I'm going to call this object so it is going to tell me the type error author object is not callable it's just instance or an object it's not a function that we'll call it but you want to make it callable then we have we can use a Dunder method or spe special method we have that is call this method we have and suppose nothing for suppose during calling I think rather than return just print this time so I'm just going to print high now this will print high see right so this call this this this ther method will be called when the instance is called as an function as a function so we are calling this instance or this object as a function so it will see The Interpreter will ask to the object do you have any call method or are you callable so yes I have a call method so I'm callable so whatever is there in this it will this thing same we have delete also we have a d keyword if you want to delete any variable just simply we will use like d d and the name of that variable so d d like this so let's run this see now obviously it is not going to print anything but after that if you print this D after deleting this D then it will give error see name d is not defined it's not defined now because you have deleted this right so if you want that when you going to delete some special message should be shown or some special thing should be happened then we can Define this also we have a under method D it's predefined so we can Define this and while deleting it should print like maybe author object has been deleted right so let's run this see 300 this this and when you're going to delete delete this D it is going to print author object has been deleted and after that again you are printing D so it will show error name d is not defined right like this we have many Dunder methods you can go to Google and you can just search like thunder method and python you can go for documentation so here we have this thing just write down Google Dunder method python documentation and the first link you will get and here you have see this tab special methods you can click in on the special methods and here you will get see new in it is under method right d we have it's called when the instance is about to be destroyed right so like this Str Str RP rpr it is called by St Str and the builin function format and print so this Str Str is being called by these builin function format and print right I have shown you this thing you can see here see this these are also l t l e equal to greater than NE this thing we have Al also discussed when we were discussing operator overloading so this ther method is specific specifically used in operator overloading you can go and watch that video see this thing we also discussed the schable object object dot this call this is also an method it is called when the instance is called as a function right L we have get item set item delete and these are numeric type also like add subtract M mode Division exor and these are all under method this ad we have discussed right when you just write down this thing like I'm just going to print 8 + 9 so this is an operator but behind the scene it is going to call which method this method this add this one okay because see on int I I'll show you int dot see on in int we have this add this stand method and many D methods are there if you want to check out you can just print what dir int on int class how many Runner methods we have it is going to print everything see these are rner method on many methods are there so I hope you got the basic idea of what are magic method and D Dunder method and why these are called magic method because these are not being called explicitly right and when we use these methods when we want to use those builin operations on our user defined objects okay then we use under method to give our own specific definition to these methods right so I hope you got this video now I'll next then by bye take care
