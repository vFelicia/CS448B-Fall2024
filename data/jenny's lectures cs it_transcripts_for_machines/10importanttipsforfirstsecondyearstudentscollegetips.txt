so in this video I'm going to discuss some tips for firstyear and secondyear students as well right because yesterday and I think day before yesterday I got some messages two or three messages from the students mum please give some tips for firstyear students as well as in comment also I got a message I were to comment that please discuss some tips regarding firstyear and secondyear students right so say for firstyear students basically maybe I have hundred off tips regarding you know category why study related tips general tips many kind of tips are there but in this video I am going to discuss some you know I thought very few important tips which are study and study related as well as general tips but both for firstyear and secondyear students remaining tips we will discuss in some other video right so see your primary goal to take admission is what to study and obviously ultimately to get a good job right so first episod you have to maintain your CDP from starting only from first semester only right it's not like that you have to maintain very good marks like 90 plus or 90% plus or 95% plus in every semester no but obviously in final year when you are going for any companies then they have some cutoff 60% 65% these kind of cutoff right so at least try to maintain your marks above that cutoff maybe I'll suggest above at least 65% marks should be there in every semester right and it's not a big deal it's not like that for these for the this percent is you have to study for 16 hours 18 hours so 20 hours a day know at this point of time you are mature enough and you can easily score at least 65 percent marks right just to have to take care of few things fine so first your primary focus is obviously to maintain your cgpm see it's your responsibility that you have to maintain a good CDP because when you are going suppose you get a job after that obviously it's responsibilities richer duty to perform well in the company right whether you are in a mood or you are not a good mood or whatever the things but the point is you have to perform there better right so they want a candidate that is obviously performing well in the CAD mix as well right I'm not saying that above 90% marks at least 65 plus or 60 plus marks right and that matters a load it's not like that your percentage is not going to matter right at least for getting your first job it is going to matter after that when you are going to switch in that is maybe it doesn't matter here I want to add one more point don't think that you are in the college just to take the classes to attend classes practical classes you just you know take the test assignments and midterms and the session ELLs and final exams and ultimately get a good job right yeah that is fine you are here to get a job but it's not just that thing right there there are many other opportunities in the college so you have to take advantage of every opportunity that is there in the college for you right and for that you have to learn how to manage time how to study obviously this is one primary thing right at a job fine that is fine right you have to be knowledgeable right now you how to manage the time between study and other things right other things means what it's not like that I'm not saying that you have to be just a bookworm right and I'm not saying that don't study and go for other things right just have a balance of these two things right here other thing means no smoking and please no drinking at the time of your college because obviously maybe you have taken admission and you are free bird now first time you are you know out of you're out of your home and you have no one to put restrictions on you means you have not obviously you are staying in maybe in hostel or PG your parents are not there with you right so it's not like that you are a free bird and you'll do anything many of the students to these mistake that just to you know showcase or just to flaunt they start smoking or they smart you know they start drinking please don't do these kind of things just to look cool it's not at all cool it's very dangerous right plus no smoking no drinking plus you have to take care of your health as well right start a daily routine to take care of your health like maybe you can do some exercise at least for 15 minutes regularly in morning or some yoga some meditation or maybe some other kind of things or if you want to join a gym then you can go for it but you have to take care of your health as well make it as a habit right so in short you have to stay healthy as well right next is you have to improve other skills apart from studying like your soft skills maybe you can say your communication skills and suppose if you are not good in English speaking then focus on this thing also right if you need to join any English speaking course just go for it it's fine but you have to practice at your home as well or maybe at your hostel like for at your PG right so you have to improve this thing also and you have to improve your communication skills these two are different things means have confidently you have to boost up your confidence how confident Li you speak with other people your posture your body posture when you are speaking with other people when you are talking to other person just look at you know into the eyes of the other person don't hesitate don't be a shy type of person right try to overcome your you know a public speaking phobia or you can say stage 4 BIA right this is also very important right you have to develop that skill also because in first year obviously many students are having a stage fear like when it comes to the presentation part suppose a faculty asks you to give some presentation you will say that in addition and no no no I can't do this right because you will think that I'm not able to speak even how will I explain the topic what students will think about me no just forget what other people think about you just other students think about you just do your own work right you have to you have to polish yourself compare yourself with you only that yesterday it was you and today what you have improved in yourself right just focus on this thing just forget all other things that what other people other students will think about me right so whenever you have the opportunity to speak in public or to speak on stage just grab that opportunity whenever you grab you have the opportunity to you know give a presentation just go for it right without thinking about other people just go for it and make it as a habit definitely it is going to help you a load in your you know third year or final your after your graduation as well in your job as well right so you have to make it as a habit you have to develop these skills also right in your first year or if you are in second year then also you can start building these skills right next is you can work on your aptitude skills right this is also very important it's not like that just to get a job this is very important because I know just to get a job it is not you know it's not compulsory to start it from first year only but these skills will definitely going to help you in many things like obviously in placement if you are going for higher studies then if you go for gate exam then also for UCC exam UGC net exam then also for GRE exam for any government examinee banking exam or any civil examinations in every exam definitely it is going to help you the FT right so just regularly devote at least half an hour or one hour for your active skills next very important point is what many students do this mistake that if you are sitting in the classroom and if faculty is teaching something so try to understand try to complete that topic in classroom Oni suppose you have 15 minutes of classroom 50 minutes class right and you have wasted your time just in you know you are not attentive in the class you haven't get anything of that lecture means you have wasted your 50 minutes there right and time is very important here fine if you are in class if you are on bunk that is fine because obviously you have to you know feel everything you have to feel that college life it's not like that you have to attend all the classes right you you can take you can have bunk bunk also that is fine but if you are in class then be attentive and try to understand try to complete the topic in the classroom plus don't hesitate and please ask as many questions as you can to the faculty because you have paid for it right you are paying for it now fine so you have to utilize your money 100% utilization or else I would rather say more than 100 percent so try to you know cover up all the doubts try to clear all the doubts try to ask the question to the faculty don't think that yeah this is a silly type of questions if I would ask this question then students will laugh on me right I am NOT going to ask this I am going to study from the book and that is fine if you are not get many students do these kind of mistake if you are not getting anything what you will think I will cover the topic after the class or from the book book only I'm not going to ask any question from the faculty you are a shy type of person please don't do this thing right you have invested your 50 minutes there so try to invest your time don't waste your time right if I know it's impossible to understand 100% topic in the class because obviously I was one of you I have done BTech I was in first year and from my experience I am telling you these points right whatever mistakes I have done and now I think that I wish someone would have told me these points when I was in my first year right so this is definitely going to help you right maybe you have at least you have grabbed 50% of the topic that is also fine right if you haven't if you are not you are not attentive in the class you haven't get anything maybe after going home you try to study that topic right so maybe it will you know you will take more time to get that topic I am NOT saying that you are not going to get that topic maybe you are smart enough but it will take more time why you have this state you are 50 minutes there again 50 minutes or one hour at home only right and so please try to cover the topic in the classroom only sixth point is while understanding the topic in the class make notes with your hand with pen and paper because whatever you will write with pen and paper it will be in your mind for longer amount of time right if you will not revise the topic on the same day after the class it's fine when the exams will come obviously you will do that what last night fight so when you will read out your notes your hand made notes then definitely you will get in less time and better you will get rather than the book right so this is also very important try to make it as a habit right next I want to say that explore the college all the activities maybe in your college many clubs and activities are there so try to explore everything don't just stick to the classes only right don't just stick to the study only explore everything try to participate in other kind of events as well maybe cultural events also right like maybe in singing or dancing or painting or you know sketching or maybe to create best out of waste these kind of activities right always trying to participate in these kind of activities right it will boost up your confidence because when you will participate in any event or activity definitely you are going to open up you are going to interact with other classmates or other students so you are seniors or more with faculties right so it is going to help you definitely write try to open up always you know talk with your it's not like that don't just be a reserved type of you know student at the class let like I'm going to talk with two or three people or these five people we are not concerned with other classmates no don't do this thing try to explore the college everything in the college right or maybe if you can you can say you can manage any event right if you get the support unit II that is also very good it will increase your management skills right you're leading skills you will get in touch with more people more figure B's right next important point is what you have to get in touch with your faculties I am NOT saying that you know that chap Lucy type of thing just to get some good internal marks or these kind of things I hope you are getting my point but you have to get in touch with the faculties in a good way we can see it happens with many students that many faculties don't even know your name you know at the till at the end of the semester right that is not a good thing you are in college get in touch with your faculties share your ideas maybe regarding any study type of thing or anything or general ideas or maybe regarding some events or some activities or any kind of thing right so that more and more faculty is you know know at least your face or your name that the address is the student in our college fine that would be beneficial for you next is if you are really very interested in study you are a study type of material and you want to learn something at your own then you can go for online courses there are many online courses available maybe if you are interested if you are interested in programming then go for one language right like in first semester in second semester you are having si so you can start learning see also right just to have a you know solid base definitely if you are good and see then you will get better or you will get easily C++ and in Java if you are not interested in programming and if you want to go for don't want to want to go for C then fine you can go for any other course right according to your interest but please don't waste your time fine especially especially those you know summer vacations after first year after first year also you can go for some internship program that is also a good idea right it's not like that after 30 and only you will go for internship or after secondary only when college will ask you to you know go for some internship that only you will go no after first year only you can also try for internship that is very very that you know very very beneficial for you next as you can read if you are not interested in studying if you don't want to go any for any online course that is fine just try you know try to make a habit of reading books books means it's not study related books maybe it can be some general type of books some novels you are interested in or maybe in some other subjects like you are interested more in to know more about earth or space or you can you know you can say you can study these kind of books also or maybe you are interested in Ayurveda then you can read Ayurvedic books also many types of books are available so according to your interest please read books make it as a habit write at least you will get many new things you know you can read books about any other places also other countries you you will get to know about other countries your you know reading skills would be improved your vocab would be you know improved many more benefits would be there but please make it as a habit at least for half an hour you can do daily write or maybe for some other skills you can go for typing skills if you want I think it's fun to you know increase your typing speed and I think everybody would be interested in typing right so you can go for this also right so these are some tips there are many more tips see for first year and especially for firstyear students so maybe we will cover these steps those steps in different video that's all for this video now I
