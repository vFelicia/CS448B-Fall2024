hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so this video especially for those students who are really interested in learning coding and want to make their career in this field okay I'm going to tell you a great way to utilize your summer break this time and what does it see code Studio by coding ninjas has come up with an amazing 45 days coding challenge so you can just during your summer breaks solve programming challenges and master data structure and algorithm because they have designed this challenge in the form of complete roadmap for data structure and algorithm so it is going to be started from 2nd of May till 16th of June right and each day they'll add a new problem and you will get complete day to solve that problem submit it and next day you will get another problem and these problems will be in the sequence of different topics aligned for data structure and algorithm so here you can master all the essential topic of data structure and algorithm and ready for your next maybe you know internship and job interviews and the complete roadmap would be something like this like on day one day lab problem on mathematics then they do also mathematics day three mathematics then sorting then arrays then sorting then searching then string recursion hashing after that link list stack queues then trees band research Heap graph greedy and dynamic programming so in this sequence one by one each day they'll add one problem and you will get one complete day to solve that problem and submit your solution right on the next day you will get one new problem so now how you are going to register for this contest what benefit you will get why you why you will register for this thing right so I'll be telling you everything one by one let's see okay so the link I'll put in the description box of this video to register for this challenge whenever you click on that link this type of page would be open to you and then you will click on login to enroll here you can start your code Studio with Google account Facebook or naukri.com account or you can just enter your email address right so I am entering my email address now it will show send OTP to my email because I have already registered for this code studio right on the scoring ninjas if you are the first time if you are coming you know here first time then once you enter email address it will here it will show continuance you will click on continue you have to enter your name and then OTP right after that it will ask one or two few questions like set up your goal or your default you know your journey you can just click there stick to uh default journey and that's it right and here I'll like click on send OTP on my email just enter the saute p and login right so that's it now this page again would be short but at this time here we have go to challenge so click on go to challenge and this is the 45 days coding challenge although it has not started yet because the first problem would be live on second of May it would be start from second book May but for your practice they have added three or four problems right so you can solve these problems and practice right okay now each day they'll add one problem so once you will solve those problems the difficulty level would be easy moderate and hard so you will get some point for easy problem you will get 40 points see as you can see here these four are easy problems so you will get here 40 points 40 experience point you can collect these experience points right so because they have you know add some fun to this coding challenge they have improved this version for solving the moderate problem you will get 80 point for solving hard problem hard problem you will get 180 point right why to collect these experience point because once you collect these experience point you can unlock the levels you can unlock some paid features see right now my experience Point are 125 so if you want to see then this is my experience history I haven't solved any problem yet these for goal setup and first login 125 points I got so levels you can see from here right I'm at level two now genius because level first is autocomplete right for everyone you will if you will log in here you will enter Then level one is auto company level two is what for genius time and space complexity basically it will compare your code runtime performance with your peers and you know it will give you where you are standing the percentile score because see these time and space complexity two are very important thing once when you will solve problem there are two approach one is simple one one is efficient one when you try to find a solution at first any solution like simple solution you will not care about time and space complexity but every obviously that interviewer expect you to give some efficient solution that take less time and space complexity right so this thing is also very important okay like this we have levels then if you get like uh 250 points then level level three would be unlocked and level three you will get video Solutions contest rating there like this there are up to 10 level level four if you have a low level four if you go to 500 experience point if you have collected 500 points then you will get this book cracking the coding interview questions for free like this up to 10 levels you will be here right so you will unlock you can unlock some paid features and have to gain these points just solve the problems right okay there are some frequently asked questions also you can go there and like like what is this 45 days challenge duration of this challenge is 45 days half this challenge will work this is also very important see you have to register that I have told you login and register accept this challenge then post it to your LinkedIn and Instagram account right and then start your challenge log in into the code Studio platform and start your challenge solve one problem daily and maintain this problem streak for 45 days because at last you will get completion certificate also so if you maintain this streak for 45 days then after completion you will get a certificate and then you will also get some coding ninjas amazing coding ninjas merchandise some vouchers some gifts Amazon vouchers like this so why you should take this challenge definitely it will help you to improve your you know thinking capability your critical thinking and develop a habit of coding it will improve your consistency right so and or see I have told you you can get an exact time complicity analysis of your problem and a solution in all the three languages C plus plus Java and python and this thing I have told you you can collect these this experience points and when you solve the problems and you can unlock some paid features right so how we are able to solve the problem just click on any program like this maximum distance and here you will get that problem statement where you can write on your code you can select your language like here it has photo is C plus plus you can select Java or pythoning which you are comfortable you can select that language you can write on your code and then seventh year okay now let me just tell you the profile how your profile will look once you'll click here you can click here your view profile and this type of profile this is your profile here how many problems you have solved that thing would be solved it will be uh seen here so in April like this is for April 23 but this is going to be started from May so I know from the next month they will add May once you will solve the problem on that day green mark would be there right and this profile would be shown to the recruiters the highest they can directly see your profile from here and they can directly contact you so by looking at that profile only they will you know get to know it's just an indication to those high risk and interviewer sorry the recruiters that you are a good Corner if you maintain the consistency and your profile is good see I haven't solved any problem that is why something like zero total problem solved let me just show you one more you know so this is the student this is a profile of a candidate who is consistent who has been consistent on this platform right sold you know three five four seven total problems till now easy moderate hard problems and ninja problems so see the Green Dot see the analysis better than 99 contest attended 13 attended and like the source this kind of profile so it's I think I would recommend to maintain this kind of profile if you really want to get a good placement and you can attempt this this thing on this contest on board Studio only right so I guess this is a very good idea to spend year to utilize your summer breaks just so you have to just solve one problem every day that's it so it will be you know like you know revising your DSA Concepts right so the link I'll put in the description box of this video the relevant links and the details the description box of this video you can go and check out now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
