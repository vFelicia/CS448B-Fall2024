so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen tuples in Python the next topic is sets in Python right sets are also used to store multiple items in a single variable name but how they these are different from tuples and list that also we'll be discussing in this video right what are sets how you can use these things in your program when to use sets over tuples and list right how this is different from list and tuples and basically you know different different methods in build function you can use on sets some operations like Union intersection different symmetric difference update many things are there like I hope you have read sets in mathematics these are almost same so these thing these all functions methods and everything we'll be discussing in this video with the help of program practically also I will show you on my laptop right now see sets are same used to store multiple items in a single variable name so how you will you can say Define a set same first thing you will take a name like I am taking set one right and now in curly brackets you will write down those multiple items whatever you want to store it may be integer the item set item can be of any data type integer string float Boolean right or it can be mixed data type right like in the same set I am storing first integer value then I'm taking like a Boolean value then I'm taking string value then I'm taking like maybe float value something like this so this is also possible or maybe if you are taking like 1 to 10 minus 10 0 53 the data this is what all the data data items are of integer type all the data Rhymes may be of string type it's okay everything is allowed right but one thing duplicate items are not allowed in set it's like we cannot write down here again one because one and one these are duplicates once you will print this set if you print this set to then only one time one would be printed right so duplicate items are not allowed in set but in tuples hand list duplicate items are allowed next thing these set items are unordered they are not having any defined order like in tuples and list why I am saying this if I ever said something like this this is my set set two and I'm printing this set so maybe you will get this answer to 10 0 minus 10 53 and 1. it is not a guarantee that you will get the same sequence of the order of these items or the same order no you can get this order you can get items in this order maybe you will if you will run this same thing you will get this order like 1 2 minus 10 0 53 10 something like this different order so that is why I am saying these items are unordered they are not having any defined order okay but in tuples and list items are ordered and this is what I'm these I am telling you the difference you can note down these things right next thing indexing is not allowed on set because set items are unordered indexing is one using index you can access these items like zero one two three four five so if I write like set two and index is two so maybe you are thinking it will give you this 10. but no indexing is not allowed why so because these are unordered they are not having any they are not having any defined order maybe you print this time this 10 is at first Index this time this 10 is at last index so that is why that is why you cannot exist set items using indexing because these are unordered I hope now you know how why indexing is not possible here right but in less than Tuple indexing is possible next thing is what these set items are unchangeable means you cannot change these items like if I want to change suppose at index 2 this is suppose I am saying this is 10 I'm assuming this is 10 I want to store here 30. this is not allowed why so because using indexing obviously subscripting is not possible here this indexing is not possible it knows it is not necessary that at second index we have 10 right so these items cannot be changed but you can change the complete set means you can add items after creating the set you can remove items for those we are having methods add and remove many methods that I'll show you practically right next property is what okay this I have already told you like this is also possible a set of having mixed airtime items or you can say heterogeneous elements are also allowed inside right now and see if I write like in this set if I'm writing here one then what do you think there is any duplicate item yes because here this is one this is true two means in mathematics true means right one only zero means false so it will while you will print this it will either show this one or this true only because this is also duplicator event zero or we are having zero and false these are also duplicate values right now let me show you this thing practically and some methods also like add remove this card clear these methods object right okay so let's create a new project new file and we are discussing sets underscore python Dot py right so let me just make a set and we are taking value something like this like 10 56 89 90 one is taking like Jenny and we are taking true okay let's print this simply set one okay this is how you can print a set so see First Property I'm telling you these items are unordered I have told you now let's run this end C the order of the items first we got true but we have written through in the last true the 1956 and 19 Jenny right so the set items are unordered they are not having any defined order duplicates are not allowed if I write here again 10 if I write here 1 and again run this see you will get 10 one time only and you are getting true you are not getting one here this one entry will duplicate ten ten duplicate so one time only it will show duplicate items are not allowed indexing not allowed if I want to X is like second item from set one and let's run this you will get an error like set object is not subscriptable subscribing this is what subscript so this is not allowed here this will give a type error indexing is not allowed slicing is not not allowed here like in Tuple and list all right if you want to create an empty set like set two so what you will do generally like that's it maybe you are thinking this will be an empty set so let's if you want to check the type of this how you will check data type of this we have type function type set one right and for set to also I'll be checking type right type set to fine so let's run this and see what output you are getting see the for first you are getting set okay the class is set for this one but for second set it is not a set it is a dictionary you have created a dictionary empty dictionary because this is not allowed in set if you want to create an empty set then you have to use set function like this there are two method to define a set with these curly bracket and with this method also set and in this bracket you can write down the values so two methods are there so to create an empty set you have to use this method only with curly braces in Python you cannot create an empty set that would be a dictionary now let's run this again this time C both are set and set the type of set 1 is set to a set if you want to change a value here then you can do like this let me just comment this out and uh I want to change like in set one at second index I want it should be 89 No it should be 99 at second index let's run this it will give an error take a set object does not support item assignment so you cannot change these set items are unchangeable but this complete set you can modify we have some method if you want to add a new value in this set so how you can add we have a method let me just show you we have a method set just the name of the set set one we have dot add method so here you can simply print like 99 I want to add 99 and do this and after that I want to print set one Cena be here 99 here right so like this you can add one item one item at a time right if you want to find out length of the set then also we have a method we have Len method and bracket you just pass the name of the set okay after adding 99 let's see now the length would be 7 how is the seven maybe you are thinking one two three four five six seven eight items you are having one item we have added so it should be ten but no because these two are duplicates so we are having only one two three four five six items right and one we have added seven so it will give seven so length you can find out like this right if you want to remove an item simply rather than add you can write down here remove and if you want to remove this one like uh 10 I want to remove so see what you will get here true 90 Jenny 56 and 89 right so maybe you are thinking 10 is 2 times so one we have removed so one should be Teno but duplicates are not allowed in set it will take 10 only one time only so n and it has removed that 10 so this you are getting right but the thing is if you will not if I am writing here like 67 68 but 68 is not there in the set so what it will give it will throw a key L exception or you can see an error right key error is 68 because 68 is not present here right second thing we can use one more method this card so set one same dot we have a method discard if you want to discard here again 10 same it will remove the item from this C10 is not there but if in discard I am writing 68 so it will not give any exception it will just print the original value of this set right this is how this this card is different from remove if this key this element is not present in the set it will do nothing right it will not show any error or any exception right if you want to clear all the element you can have you have a clear method set one dot clear now we do not have anything we have an empty set right we have a pop method also pop will remove any random item from this set and it will return that item also right so let me just run this so this time it has removed this true or one you can say let's remove these duplicate items and now let's run this C this time it has removed what any random item means we have 90 56 89 10 it has removed Jenny from the set right and it will return that item also right so you can if you want to print you can print also directly we can print that item Whatever item this pop has removed let's run this again see this time it has removed through and this is the set so pop will remove any random item from the list right and if nothing is left like you have popped every item like I have run this pop one two three four five six time and seventh time if you run pop then it will raise an exception right because now set is empty so pop cannot remove any item from the set and see one more thing why adding here items like set one dot add because it will not return anything so we cannot print anything while we are writing this ad so here we can add any immutable item that cannot be changed like tuples are immutable so if you want to add a complete Tuple so in add we can write down something like this 13 comma 14 comma 15. this complete Tuple I want to add in this set so let's run this C 13 comma 14 comma 15 this is completable this has been added here right but if you want to add a list because list aren't these square brackets what do you think it will add the list here or not no why so big is less star mutable we can change the list we can change the data of the list we can add remove right so this will give an error see type error and hashable type list because set use what data structure to store these item hash table right if you want to know more about hashing then you can watch out the video that I have discussed I mean you will find in that data structure playlist so I'll put that link of that video in the side button you can check out how hashing works so it use hash table to store these items right so list is not allowed so any immutable data item you can add here like Tuple for any like string or hint you can add or Boolean item you can add float value you can add but you cannot add any mutable data items right so these are some methods here but we are left with now some operations on set like Union intersection difference those we'll be discussing in next video so I hope you got basics of set in the next video the next part of this video will see operate what operation you can perform on set so I'll show you the next video till then bye take care
