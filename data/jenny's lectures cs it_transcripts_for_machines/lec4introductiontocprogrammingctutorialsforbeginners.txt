so in the series of learning object oriented programming in c plus plus from this video i'm going to start c plus plus programming language this video will be about introduction to c plus plus in the previous videos till now we have discussed what is object oriented programming how it is different from pop processor oriented programming and basic oops concept six concepts classes objects abstraction encapsulation inheritance polymorphism in brief we have discussed these concepts right just to get you an overview about these oops concepts not in detail in detail we'll discuss one by one in later videos right so this in this video we'll be discussing some basic points so you can say introduction to c plus plus programming language first of all why we need a programming language see if you want to communicate with your friend if you want to give some instruction to your friend like bring me a glass of water then you will say how do you communicate with your friend maybe you will say a language that could be understood by your friend in hindi or english like panic a glass law or being a glass of water right a language you need to communicate with your friend right so same we cannot say like hey laptop please add two numbers the numbers are five and four please find out the number is even old no computer is not able to understand these things the language of computer is binary language only zeros and ones so we have to say that thing in zeros and ones in binary language that computer can understand but we don't know how to say it in zero and one right but yeah if there is someone between us and like our laptop who can convert we are saying add two numbers the numbers are five and four and that that thing or that person the intermediate can convert that thing into machine code like zeros and ones and then give it to you can say your computer then it would be easy like a translator we have generally not we have but whenever some delegates come from like any other country then they come with their translators like if we speak in hindi they can translate it in according to their language and if russian comes then according to their language and something like that this like so to communicate with our computers to give instruction to your system your laptop we need a language programming language right and there are multiple programming languages fine before c and c plus plus java c there are multiple programming languages also right fortran pascal leda and bcpl basic many languages were there right so now in this video we'll be discussing about c plus plus programming language so i hope this is clear to you why we need a programming language right and see obviously some tasks human being cannot do better your system and your machine can do it better efficiently right so obviously we need and why we need system or computers in our life that i hope you are aware about that thing fine these are making our life easy so some basics about first of all who invent we invented this c plus plus who developed c plus plus it was bjorn and he was a danish computer scientist since 1979 he was working on this language implementation of this language since 1979 so first of all it was known as c with classes he was working on his phd you know thesis and he wants a language which also have features of c as well as some objectoriented programming concepts now how he was aware about these oops concept inheritance obstruction polymorphism because there was one language similar 67 similar 67 is known as the first objectoriented programming language but that was very you know slow for practical use that language and c was first fast language so he wants to combine c features plus the only the oops features of similar 67 combined and that language was firstly known as named as c with classes now when it was renamed c plus in 1983 right let me just write down some points here so where at a t and t bell laboratories where c was developed in new jersey usa and the name given was c with classes and it was just an extension of c language or you can say it's a super set of c language right means it contains all the features of c as well as some additional features like oops concept right but it is not purely objectoriented programming language because some features like friend and virtual classes i guess they violate those oops features right how that will be discussing later sessions when we will discuss friend and about friend and virtual classes right so it is not purely objective objectoriented programming language so it supports like it is just extension of c superset of c so c is what you can say comes under pop so it supports multiple paradigms processor oriented programming also and object oriented programming as well as right like in c we have structure in c plus plus also we have structure and classes as well but in c we don't have classes so it is a general purpose programming language now what is this general purpose programming language see general we can say general store when you go to a general store you will find everything there so general purpose programming language means you can write software here you can build software or applications for any domain like like in c plus you can write you can use it for system programming as well as system programming as well as high level programming like you can uh implement here uh or os operating system low level programming you can also do kernels drivers you can also write down editors in c plus and see as well as it is used to build translators your compilers interpreter these things as well as some games the ui desktop applications right for every domain there is something in this language for every domain you can create a software with the help of this language that is why it is known as general purpose programming language right and it supports multiple paradigms as well as it is you can say a middle level language or you can say intermediate language it supports both the features of low level language as well as high level language you can do also system programming with the help of c plus plus you can write down you can create operating system and for do system programming you need an extensive you know very high level of knowledge of your hardware right because you are if you are creating an operating system obviously you need you need to be very close to the hardware you need knowledge of hardware in deep right so it is close to a lower level programming as well right so it is middle level language as well as high level language application we can create like gui games desktop based applications right those things we can also do with the help of c plus they don't need uh like knowledge of hardware fine if you are creating operating system you are writing programs for drivers for networking you need that level of knowledge but for creating these type of applications you don't need that kind of hardware knowledge so that is why it is used for both low level you know creating low level application as well as high level application so it is middle level language fine now next point about c plus plus is and as i have told you named as c plus plus in 1983 right now why this c plus plus as you know plus plus is an increment operator which means we are adding one value suppose i am writing int a is equal to five and i am doing a plus plus it means it becomes 6 means adding something we are increasing the value that's why we are adding some extra features in c that is why it is known as c plus plus the idea comes from this this operator increment operator which we are having in c right and it is compiled language means we need a compiler to convert the whatever we write in this c plus plus into machine code we need a compiler right not an interpreter compiler means the complete code at once will be compiled and converted into the machine code so it is a compiled language and it is object oriented programming language why so because it follows the oops concept and what are oops concept we have discussed in previous video right classes objects abstraction polymorphism inheritance encapsulation and the latest version of c plus pluses c plus plus 20 which came in here 20 20. four major release was there c plus plus 11 c plus plus 14 c plus plus 17 and c plus plus 20 in 2011 2014 2017 and 2020 now next come will be coming in c plus plus 23 in 20 23 so the history will be discussing in a separate video so this is all about introduction to c plus plus language and the next video will be c will be you know discussing history of c plus plus as well as we'll see some features of c plus plus language right you can see how this is different from c language what differentiate it from the c language so now i'll see in the next video till then bye
