so when the series of learning Python programming language we are done with sets in Python so the next topic is Loops in Python so in this video we'll be discussing about for Loop in Python right okay now what is loop basically Loop is what when you are repeating the same thing or same action again and again that is what a loop nothing else right like if you want to print number from one to five so simply you are repeating the same action what you will do in Python if you I ask you to print number from one to five what you will do simply like print one then print two something like this until print five means same action here action is what print same action is repeating again and again here you're repeating the same action again and again that is not a loop that's it right like suppose if your mom is having a list to buy the things to buy from the supermarket and she asked she asked you like first thing is banana and he asks you like uh go and buy banana you go to supermarket buy a banana and come back to home then again the second item Buy Apple you go to supermarket again come back third item like maybe by dragon fruit so you go to supermarket buy dragon fruit come to home means you are in Loop you are doing same action again and again going to supermarket buy something and come to home kind of that thing right but the better idea is like you just take the list go to supermarket take a trolley pick the first item banana that item put in Trolley second item like mango like this all the items at the same time and come to home that is better option right so yeah basically I hope you got this what is a loop basically right repeating same action or same thing again again and again that is a Loop right so in programming also we have to do these kind of tasks sometime we have to repeat some statements or some instructions again and again some statements for again and again right so you can put so that is what a loop so you can put those statements under a single line like in a loop and you don't have to write the same statements again and again so this thing we can do with the help of loop how that also I'll tell you in that case you need to write down the Sprint only single time like one time not five time because yeah that is fine you can write down print five times but if I ask you to print 100 times 1 200 if I ask you to print one to two hundred one two thousand so it is not possible to write down thousand time print statement and that is obviously a you know waste of space right and waste of your time right so better to use Loops in Python for this thing we have loops in Python basically two types of loop for Loop and while loop third is also that is a nested Loop nested means what within Loop within a loop like you are you have written a for Loop within that Loop you have written again a for Loop or maybe a while loop right that is what a nested Loop but mainly two types of loop four and Y so in this video we'll be talking about four Loop so here four Loop is what in Python basically maybe if you have a red for Loop in other languages c c plus Java then it is not the same like like we have discussed in other languages right in Python this for Loop is more like an iterator Now what is iterator iterates you can say which is used to do some iteration iteration system is what traversing a sequence one by one reversing a sequence one by one that is called iteration sequence here is what now sequence in Python is what collection of item sequence data times or List double set dictionary that we haven't discussed we will be discussing later string is also a sequence so like this if we have a list something like this if we have like four names so this is a list or you can say this is a sequence collection of items right so traversing of this sequence traversing means go to first item then second item then third item then fourth item like this so this is what traversing this is what iteration and using iterator we do this iteration so that is basically in Python for Loop is more like an iterator right so we can say a for Loop in Python is used used to iterate over a sequence in Python right and do some specific action for each item or you can do some specific action on each item in that sequence right rough sequence may be a list or a set or a tuple or a string or a dictionary let's take one example how you will let's see syntax or for Loop you simply write this four you will be writing a variable name here any variable name in membership operator not in an in with discussed in here you will write that sequence name sequence then column sequence may be a list of this name or a tuple name or whatever you have taken that sequence name and here you can write down those statements one statement or multiple statements can be there this is simple syntax of writing a for Loop there is no specific condition like in other languages we have we have to initialize for Loop then we will be giving some condition then increment agreement and all so nothing you have to specify that's it you have to do in Python right you don't have to initialize any like variable name or anything fine now in this case suppose I have this list list one list one is this so what you will write like four you variable any variable name you can take like I'm i a b c d x y z anything so if these are names right or you can say here also you can take a uh that meaningful name names list name is names so I'm taking a meaningful variable name also four name not the same variable name that you have taken the sequence name that should be different here we have names here we have name for name in sequence name is what names for each name in names what you need to do here you can do whatever you want to do simply the very basic and simple thing and I just want to print print and I just want to print each name after traversing I want to print each name so print this variable name you have to write down here print name that's it okay I forgot the semicolon and please this statement would be indeed indented this indentation is very important otherwise it will be better you will if you will write them print here here without any indentation it will give error right so better take some indentation here now what it will give what is the working first names is what this so it would be here this complete list would be here or rather than this directly here rather than names directly you can put this list here that is also fine so now first of all this what is the internal working this this names would be replaced with this list now for name in names first name Jenny would be assigned to this name this is a variable name or a placeholder so in name first we have gen for Jenny in names so condition is true in operator membership operator that is that will give it a Jenny in Jenny is present in this list names so it will give true so enter into for Loop and print name so in name we have Jenny so it will print Jenny now again now next is Ram so next time Ram would be assigned to this name Ram in names yes true print name so next line Ram we appended like this next time Rahul would be assigned to this name next time pile will be assigned to this name all the conditions are to do and we will print till the end of the list it will print over the engineer Rahul and pile something like this so this is simple working of for Loop right it will do these actions whatever you will write here it will execute these statements for each item in the sequence foreign right if rather than this if you simply take string then also it will work if I simply take this string Jenny this is also a sequence so in names now we have Jenny string in name now what we have first time we will have J so J in names yes so it will print first J then e then n n y something like this right so if we draw flowchart or simply if we try to draw flowchart for this for Loop then that would be like for each item in sequence what it will do last item reached if this is true then exit from full loop right but if this is not true but this is not the last item in the sequence then what it will do whatever the statement is there that would be executed if this is false and then again will be here so this is kind of flowchart you can draw for this for Loop in Python right once last item reached exit from for loop I told you it is more like an iterator method that we find in other object oriented programming languages not more like for Loop right in other languages the for Loop is there so not same that for Loop but it's more like an iterator means we execute these set of statement once for each item in the sequence right yeah but also now how you will print like one two hundred and one to two hundred that also we can do for that we have another method in function here that is range function so you can use range function for Loop and you can print uh the numbers also right now let me just show you this thing with the help of practically we will see like a program with helper program I'll show you okay so let's create a new file here I'll be naming it for underscore Loop dot p y right okay simply first we will take any sequence let's take a list why Always list let's take a string only so I will be taking like name equal to and here I am taking Jenny that's it now for let's take a variable name let's take I in item you can take for I in this name then colon and you simply you want to print it that is the simplest action we can do print print but you have to put here variable name I right let's just run this and I'll show you c j e n n y you have traversed this sequence using for Loop that's what iterator do right iteration traversing or sequence and this statement can be executed once for every item in this this sequence so this time I'll be taking a list so now this time we have names this list and same you can do with this if you you can just variable name is I is fine let's run this and this time C Jenny Ramen right but within this you can also this is what the simplest thing we can do but we will use it during more complex actions and within this not exactly one statement you can write multiple statements also right and see the indentation part that is very important if you do not put here indentation that is by default actually because see whenever after this I enter Then cursor is here by default indented so simply like print right but if you do note if you remove this indentation that would be an error see indentation error expected an indented block after four statement in life so you have to be very careful about this indentation part because this will specify a block these whatever statements are indented that are under this for Loop right in C or C plus plus one another the language is for representing the block we use curly braces right but here we don't have such kind of thing simply indented means this this is under the for Loop and this is a block so rather than this we can also here print some other thing we can also do like if I print some condition if this I equal to equal to Jenny if this is the case Okay so Jenny is a string so we must put the same here if this is the case again I enter and again it is indented after if also we need some indentation right and simply suppose I print uh hey it's me nothing but simply I know that is not having much sense but taking just simple example so let's run this and see first name is Jenny after Jenny it will check if the name is this I is Jenny yes I in I we have now Jennifer's time Jenny would be assigned to the side right so it will print H me then Ram then Ram this is not true for Ram so sham and Sham and this is also not true for sure so after Jenny 2 print hates me right so we'll take one more complex example now so I am having suppose a list list one and I am having some numbers here like two three any number you can take like minus two and any number we can take then and I want to calculate square of each item square of each item in the list right so first we have to access each item then we calculate square right so how you can access each item we have a full loop here 4 like I in list one or if you take more meaningful name better to take meaningful names so let's take numbers right for I in numbers right you have to calculate squares so let's take a variable M Square only square is equal to this I and this is our operator 2. and simply I can print Square let's run this C 4 9 25 4 and 100 so minus two it's four only right plus 4 and 100. but I want rather than this I want list of these squares like this a list should be printed so that is your you can say quiz for this class so pause the video and try this out you have to calculate square but you have to print rather than this a list right now if you are blank right now so you can go through the list and list methods actually all the methods and you will find out appropriate method for this so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this what we can do we can take another empty list and we can add Square in that list and we can print that list so let's take an empty list is an empty list this is empty list we don't have anything right now after calculating this Square what we can do rather than directly printing what we can do in squares in that empty list so squares we can append that Square value so don't append this is the correct method and here we will put what you need to add here Square this Square do not get confused in these names this is squares list name is squares and square is a variable name in which we have square of each item so the square we will add here and rather than printing here after this for Loop we will print what Square this list that's it let's run this and see now here we got the list fine or if you want to print something like this uh the uh list of squares is and comma that is also fine here you can put that list name so see the list of squares says this so rather than just printing we can do many other things with this for Loop but that is what over a sequence you can use this for Loop here we have a range method so that also will be discussing so you have to take any sequence and for each item of that sequence you can do whatever you want to do the section these two lines are indented so this is what for these two lines are under in this four Loop this is what outside of the pole Loop because this is not indented right and if you if what if I put indent in the on this sign also this line would also be now a part of 4 new now let's see what happens see this line would also be printed five times because here we have five items for each item list of square is first four then four nine then this then this and then this right so I hope you got the difference so you can now try this out different different sequence like for tuples or sets different different things because we have taken only string and uh list so on tuples on set dictionary so I haven't discussed and you can try out anything while iterating over that sequence right so I hope you got what is for Loop in Python now next is we can also use else with for Loop yes four else you have must have heard if else but 4 else is also possible so that will be discussing in next video and I'll see in the next video bye take care
