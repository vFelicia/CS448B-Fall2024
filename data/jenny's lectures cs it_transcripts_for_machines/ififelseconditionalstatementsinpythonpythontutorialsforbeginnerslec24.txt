so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise live in weeks and we have discussed what are up string and based on that we have seen that exercise right so now in this video we'll talk about if statement and if else statement in Python these are known as conditional statements or control statements also we can say decision making statements simple if if else nested if else La LC platter these are decision making statements right or conditional statements so one by one we will discussing these statements in this video we'll talk about if and if else with the help of real life example as well as with the help of program the syntax when we should use if else when we should we should use if statement all the things we'll be discussing in this video right now before they just want to tell you one thing see the journey towards becoming a PSU officer or pursuing mtech from IIT or other Elite Institute is going to be long

subscribe today and start your gate and Esa preparation and to Avail these discounts use my code jkl10 so all the relevant links and details you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what are what are the this if else and if statement in Python see let's take one real life example whenever you go to generally you travel in Metro so there is a board like if your child height is less than three feet then no token required right you don't need to purchase any token or ticket anything right but if height is more than three feet three feet then you have to purchase token so there is some condition right in a real life also every day we are facing these type of conditions and based on some conditions we take decisions right like if you go to supermarket and your mom say please bring some you can say buy some apple maybe you'll ask if apples are not available then what should I buy then maybe oranges and if oranges are not available then maybe dragon fruit so there also you have to decide like maybe you are a coffee lover or but based on your pocket money you will have coffee maybe in Starbucks or at some store now that that decision is based on your pocket money right how much money you have so in real life also we are taking multiple you know many decisions every day so when we write program then also obviously we will maybe we are working on a project we'll create some product and all so to map these decision making these things in programming how you can write down these things so for those we have conditional statements using IF else using alif using you know multiple effects necessary fails else if ladder we can map these decisions we can write down these decisions in our programming in program in the form of programs right so that is why these are known as conditional statements or you can say decision making statements fine now that that let's take that that example that height height of your child so if I like if I draw a flowchart then obviously start and here we have a condition height is greater than three feet I am taking height I am taking in feet two condition can be there yes your child height is a greater than three or not or no if yes height is greater than 3 feet then token required to board Metro if no then no token required so this is how we can like we can you know draw a flowchart kind of thing right this is the case so to map this thing in program what we will write if else because here we have two choices yes or no so if or else if apples are there in Supermarket by apples by apples otherwise buy oranges two choices you have right if there is only one choice maybe your mom say if apples are available then buy apples otherwise nothing back to your own come back so that that we can write with simple if no else required but here we have two choices so if and else right now what is this General syntax of writing if simple we will write if and here some condition then Colin then the block of statement that should be executed if this condition is true that would be here we can write down like do this else colon do this right C let me just tell you one thing one thing is very very very important when you write if else in python or when you write programming in Python that is indentation because python basically use indentation to identify a block what is this indentation like if you write this statement then after some space this space before you know in the beginning of this line This is known as indentation right so if we write condition condition you can write down in these brackets also or if you do not put these brackets that is also fine in Python right both the cases are true but this space this indentation is must directly you cannot write down from here do this that will give you error I'll show you with the help of programming right what type of error you will get after else also you have to do some indentation and here if we are writing multiple statement like three statements so all the three statements should be intended leave some space here and then write down these statements right so those statements would be considered as block of statement after if right so this is General syntax of writing if now let me just show you uh this thing with the help of one program and practically we'll see this thing so here obviously this condition should be evaluated and should return either true or false based on true or true or false this the control will go either in this blue Orient this block right so like height greater than 3 so we'll enter height like height is 4 4 is greater than 3 or not yes so that will give you that will give true so true means token required Yes means this way will go right so here we are using these relational operators or we can say comparison operators we have discussed this thing like less than equal to greater than equal to or like less than greater than or double equal to like for equality check we use double equal to or not equal to these are some relational operators for comparison operators we can use while checking some condition while giving here some condition right now let's see with the help of one program and if you want to draw General flowchart for this if else then simply here we rather than height greater than 3 we simply write like condition here condition true or folds two cases can be there right not yes or no true true means here we can write if block statement if block statement would be executed here else block statement would be executed and after that obviously program will you know after whatever statements after those if else block that would be executed right right that would be executed statement out of if else look that would be executed right so this you can say General flowchart of if else right so let's create a new file and we will be discussing if else right so if underscore else dot p y right let's take height so directly when we are taking using input function we can convert that into integer because we know enter height whatever you will take using input function that would be string so convert that into int right now let's check what is the condition if height your child height child sided is uh greater than three feet let me just write down this thing enter height in feet right so if height greater than 3. feet right colon see as you can see whenever the cursor is here and whenever y I will enter I will press enter see automatically the cursor is here there are some space in the beginning of this line so that is what indentation that is very important then print what we should print height is greater than three then token required or we can say by token right enter now else we will write here no indentation before else colon and print note open required right okay let's run this and I'll show you first of all see it is asking enter height in feet I am entering 4. so by token because height is 4 greater than 3 this condition is true so control will enter here and by token right if I again run this and I enter 2 then no token required because condition is not true in this case so control will go in else part and no token required so this is simple working of a fence statement now let me just show you something if you do not put here that indentation or the white space then see you can see this red line here and let's run this see this there is something wrong here because this this is some Arrow there is something wrong here so it will give you glue and error is indentation error there are names this is indentational expected and indented block after if statement on line number three so after F there should be some indentation that is indentation block so that should be indented and if I write one more statement like print buy token token and now you can board the Metro right so see these both these statements are intended right so this would be considered as a complete block of statement after if so now if I run this and if I enter height like five so buy token and now you can board the metal these two print statement would be executed because this is now block of statements after if right but after this if I do not put any indented indentation it will give error let's run this C syntax error this is syntax error something here in else part because between if and else this print statement would not be considered now as a part of this if block right but if you are using IF else between if and else there should be nothing right and you are writing this statement so this is wrong better you put this in this block right so I hope you got this thing how to use if else now if simple if rather than else we have only one choice simple if right no else part let's suppose remove the sales part comment this out if height is greater than 3 then buy a token and this thing that is only case no else part let's run this greater than 3 means six so buy token now you can board the metro and if this is less than three like two nothing would be printed because there is no else part but but if I write one more line something like this print out of if block the statement is out of fifth law because there is no indentation here let's run this and height is now I'm entering two so now it will print out of if block this print statement only because these two print statement would be considered as part of this if because these are intended this is not intended so this is out of it if I do not put any indentation here so now this only would be part of this if block these two are not part of if block let's run this and if I enter 6. so height is greater than 6 is greater than 3 so only one line would be printed by token that's it right sorry buy token and now there is no else part so these two statements are part of program only so obviously after if those statement would be executed that are part of program normal execution of program would be there so these three statements would be executed right and if I run this and if I enter like height is 2 now only 2 statement would be executed now you can board the metro and out of if block these two only because now this print by token is part of the sift block right and if you do not put like these sorry the these brackets that is also fine because I am actually from C and C plus plus background so that is why I used to put these brackets let's run this there would be no error right height is 3 if I enter height 3 because 3 Less Than 3 no condition is not true so now know if block these two statement would be would be executed right let's do this thing and let's comment this out and if you want to put that condition also like if your child height is greater than or equal to 3 then you have to buy a token Less Than 3 then we need to buy so less than equal to greater than equal to this and you can put or if double equal to you want to check equality then double equal to also we can check but for equality you have to use double equal to not single equal to that is not that would be sub there would be some some error like if I put only one one equal to I want to check equality if height is equal to 3 but I only put one equal to so there would be some error let let me just run this and see it is showing here are some error if white is equal to syntax error invalid syntax maybe you meant double equal to or this instead of this so it is giving you some clue also you can read out these error and you can check where is the error so here it should must be some error so maybe it's not not equal to what double equal to which will be double equal to now it is there would be no error right if I enter write 4 then no token required because condition is not true height is not equal to 3 right so I hope now you got basics of if and if else statements and how to use them and what is indentation and how this indentation is important if before the site before writing this if we put space see here also in Python it will give error you cannot put any space before beginning of any line you can put space after you know at starting of those statement which are part of if block or else block right till now we have discussed till now if else on your if so see it will give error indentation error unexpected intent here height this this is the first line on unexpected intent so do not put any space here right so I hope you got what is if and what as if else how to use them when to use them and how to write down this thing in your program so in the next video we'll see when coding exercise based on these FL statements when I will say the next video till then bye take care
