so in the series of learning python programming language in the previous video we have seen input function in python we have seen print function and input function and we have also seen some coding exercise on those functions like how to use those functions and all now the next topic is variables what are variables in python how to use variables why we use variables and all this thing we will see in this video okay what is need of variable that is very important so now let's see we will start from this question why we need actually variables see if i write something like this see if i write this input what is your name means i'm asking from the user what is your name so it would be prompted on your screen what is your name and then we will whenever you run this then you will enter a name like suppose i am entering jenny and just hit enter button now that's it so see okay now this this uh jenny this name would be here this line would be replaced by this journey not actually but virtually like behind the scene it is happening but we are not storing this jenny anywhere means further in our program we cannot use this name jenny name because we haven't stored this name anywhere okay suppose uh i have some water okay now i'm pouring that water like this now it is spilled on the floor now if i store that water in another glass then i can use that water again okay so for that i have to take another container suppose from a tap we have opened the tap and water is you know spilling out on the floor if you use a bucket to store that water then we can use that water in future same in a container we are storing that thing same thing here also this jenny means it's nowhere now we cannot use this jenny name anywhere in your program so if i want to store that value i need a containers means in real life we need some container in programming we need variables so variables are nothing but containers to store some values values can be anything here and integer value like one two three numbers or strings or list or much more that also will see one by one but variables are just container to store some values in python okay now there is no need to declare any variable in python before it's used like in cb declare like in cnc plus plus there in the programming language we have to declare like if you want to take an integer variable then in a before using we have to tell the compiler like this is name of the variable this is data type of this variable but here in python we don't need to declare any variable before its use we don't need to tell any data type of the variable nothing we have to tell what you need to do you just write down the name of the variable okay the variable would be created you know at the time the moment you first assign some value to that variable that's it so suppose i want to store this name this jenny this value somewhere in the variable what you need to do before this you just write down the name of any variable any name you can take a b c x y z anything but better to use a meaningful name means i am storing a name so better to use a meaningful name according to that so name of the variable i am taking name name equal to this now at this point of time whenever you enter jenny when you run this program and hit enter button then this name this line would be replaced with jenny and this jenny would be stored in this variable name so now you can simply print this print and you can in print you can simply write down the name of the variable so it will give the result what jenny like you can take example uh in your phone book in your diary you are writing phone numbers you are simply writing phone numbers no you are not writing any name for those four numbers so in future it would be very difficult for you to find out whose phone number is this okay we cannot retrieve that thing you have if you have a list of phone numbers fine same if i write any name we write name associated to a phone number suppose i'm writing in my book i'm writing like jenny and the phone number i'm writing here right something like this now in future we can use this this number this phone number we can call this with the help of this chain we can identify like this is jenny's phone number same if you use this thing in programming we use equal to sorry this assignment operator so this jenny equal to this number so jenny is considered as a variable name in programming jenny equal to i'm assigning a phone number that's it now further if you want to refer this you can simply use you can simply call jenny okay so just a cont the variables are just containers to store some data values nothing else same if i write any variable for example you can take a variable number a is equal to 1 you can use b is equal to jenny or b equal to i am writing like uh pile it is a string string you can put in double go to single quote your wish see i'm not telling any data type like it is of integer type it is of string type or float type nothing else okay so no need to tell whenever you you know the variable this variable would be created the moment we assign first assign value to this that's it and now simply you can print print a it will print one if i print print b it will print pile yeah further we'll see how to type cast these things like from end to float or further we'll see more you know thing about these data types and variables but for this video you have to you know know the basics of what is variable how to create variable how to assign values how to use this these variables fine now as a name suggest variables variables means values can vary you can change the values of the variable these are not fixed at one time suppose i have a sign the value name is equal to input what is your name and then name or suppose uh i'm writing here something like this i'm writing i'm taking a variable name name is equal to jenny and then i am printing print name so it will print jenny again i am writing name is equal to jia and again i am printing print name so see i am taking same variable name but this the output would be jenny and jia this time it is printing jenny this time it is printing gr so we can change the values of these variables name is only variables values can vary okay so i hope you got what is variable why we need variables and how to use variables in python programming now one exercise for you is this is the case first it will ask what is your name then you will enter a name and it will print the length of that name suppose i am entering jenny so the length is j e double and y five characters are there so it will print five okay pause the video and do this now hint is how to calculate length of the string we have a uh inbuilt function that is l e n l e n this and whatever name or the string for the for which you want to find out the length you can put that thing here okay we'll see more functions and strings in later videos but for now this is the hint so let's pause the video and try this out so i hope you have done this see we'll ask will i use input function what is your name and whatever you will enter we will store that thing here in the name variable okay now len is a function to find out length of the string so in length i am you have to pass this variable name name you can pass so whatever it will return that also you can store in another variable variable name you can take anything abc xyz anything but better to take meaningful variable name so i am taking length and finally you can print length so what would be the output first when you whenever you run this what would be prompted the message on the screen what is your name what is your name this would be printed and suppose i am entering jenny and hit enter button then what is behind the scene process this jenny is here now so now the jenny would be assigned to this variable name in this name we have jenny so in length i am passing name means jenny i am passing so it will calculate the length that is one two three four five five now this five would be assigned to this variable length and i am printing this length this variable so what would be printed 5 so let's create a new file right click on this then new file and variable in python dot py okay now what we will see will take a variable the variable name i am taking name is equal to input what is your name okay and we will print now at this time name fine now let's run this it is asking what is your name and i'm entering here jenny click enter and it will print jen jenny has been stored in this variable name name now see rather than rather than this now i can take again i'm taking name equal to suppose i'm taking here jia and again i am printing print name let's run this again and see so first it will ask what is your name i am entering jenny so first it will print jenny then it will print gr because that first time the value in the name variable is what jenny now we have changed this uh value in this variable that is gr so this point of time in name we have g so it will print g gr okay now how to find out length what you can see we can use a length variable name or any variable name you can take l you can take but l would be not so meaningful by looking at that we cannot get like l is what length is equal to we can use a function lan and in lan we will pass the variable name name and just print length rather than name we will print this time length this variable so let's just comment out these line to comment outline we use hash symbol in python let's run this now it will ask what is your name i am entering jenny and it is printing length five again enter i'm entering pile again five let's take another name having different length jia it is printing four okay so you can check out this thing and one more thing we can do something like this suppose we have just done this thing hash and here also we have come committed out everything i am taking simple variable a is equal to 1 b is equal to i'm here i'm assigning a value like vyansh and i'm printing print a and print b so let's run this what it will print one and we aren't so any variable you variable name you can take no need to tell the data type the a value is one so it will print one b value is vyance in the string so it will print b simple okay but see if you want to concatenate these two thing a and b that could give error suppose i am writing a plus b i want to concatenate but it will give error let's run this and see type error it is a type error unsupported operands for plus one operand is int one operand is string so one is into one is string so we cannot concatenate this is type error type error it is not syntax error because in print syntax is same like in plus we have something on the left hand side something on right hand side syntax is correct but type error is there so it cannot concatenate these things both should be same like what should be string or concatenation plus can be used to concatenate strings only okay and see in this case it it can be a case like name is equal to input what is your name okay now rather than b is equal to vyan so at this point of time i am suppose rather than am taking name name plus b see the difference now let's run this what is your name i'm entering my name is one now at this time concatenation is possible c one and beyonce so name at name we have one plus b is string beyond so it has concatenated but you will say that one is integer now at this time how it is possible i have told you whenever we have discussed input function by default input function returns string so whatever you will enter one two three 4 or anything abc simple a character also a it will consider everything as a string it will return a string so at this point of time this one would be by default this one is a string that is why it will not give any error so one is a string we aren't just a string so it can concatenate these two things okay i hope you got my point
