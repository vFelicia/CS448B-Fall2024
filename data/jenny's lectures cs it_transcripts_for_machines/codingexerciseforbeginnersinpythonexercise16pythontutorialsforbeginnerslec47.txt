so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen range function in Python So based on that we'll be using we'll be doing one more coding exercise so this is very simple although you have to write down a program to sum to find out some of all the even numbers from 1 to 100 including one and hundred right so hint you just you can use range function but some of even numbers only from 1 to 100. in the previous video we have seen sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100 but this time only even numbers so there are two ways to do this exercise so I think this this is very simple no need to give you something so let's pause the video and try this out so I hope now you have done this let's do this there are two ways to do this exercise right we will discuss both the ways total is equal to 0 and in range one two one zero one one way is we can do something like this we'll be doing from 2 to 1 0 1 and will increase will take the step size two see by default first would be two what it will print first would be to I then I plus k k is 2 2 plus 2 4 then 6 then 8 all the way till 100. right so these all are even numbers you got even numbers now you can simply do total okay first I in I we will be having two second time in I will be having four so the PSI would be added in this total and we will be getting sum of even number only two five five zero second second way is if you do not provide here this third thing so till 1 so now it will print what one two three four five till 100 write the range but I want to do some of only these even numbers so yeah we have an idea okay sorry here what we can do we can write down we can check if this I we can check the number is even or not if this I mode 2 equal to equal to 0 means it will be completely divisible by two then definitely it would be even number so there only then only we will do total okay so this total would be now in this four Loop indented right and after that we can simply print this okay I hope now you got this the second way is this let's run this and you will get the same two five five zero so I hope now you get familiar with this range function how to use this right so I hope you have done this exercise successfully so now we'll do the next video till then bye take care
