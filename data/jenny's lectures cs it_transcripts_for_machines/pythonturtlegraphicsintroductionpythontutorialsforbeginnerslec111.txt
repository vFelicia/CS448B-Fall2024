hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed modules and packages in Python right so now in this video we'll be discussing what is turtle module from this video onwards we'll be discussing about this Turtle modu right because we are discussing this thing in deep so it would take like two to three videos at least to cover this thing in detail right so what is turtle module how to use this how to check if this module you have in your you know uh system or not because generally this Turtle module is preinstalled it's a library which is preinstalled in your python when you install python then it's automatically installed uh in your python right so don't need to install it separately but if you don't have you need to install it separately right how to check that also I'll show you the command right and how to use this that also we'll see right now till now we have discussed we have return program we have uh you know created projects but with those project in those project output was on that particular you know that black screen or that console in the form of text only we get output and all right but now we want to use Graphics animations right some interesting we want to do so for that we need a you can say a module or you library that is turtle and it is very simple one that is why we are using first we are you know learning this Turtle module have you heard about a programming language logo that programming language is you know widely known for its use uh of this Turtle Graphics right and that was logo was generally for you know basically was for kids to make the language or you know interesting so it's a preinstalled library right and basically it is used to create different kind of shapes images geometric animations like you know uh like Square draw a line rectangle triangle simple simple simple uh you know uh you can say drawings or simple shapes as well as to the complex one right we will be discussing everything one by one first we'll start from simple one I have to draw a line then like a circle triangle rhombus and then more complex shapes we'll be discussing more complex geometric animations actually animations also see right so this Turtle Library contains all the methods and functions that you know we need to draw the images shapes or drawings or pictures right now this Turtle Graphics is similar to a you can say virtual canvas on canvas actually we draw something painting or and drawing or anything so it's like a virtual canvas for us right on which we are going to draw our pictures or shapes or images or drawings anything right and it also you know provide us a on screen pen actually that pen is actually a turtle you can say right that we use to draw okay those shapes or designs fine so it's like a turtle with paint brush on his back so whenever the turtle will move that paint brush will obviously draw something so if turtle is going this direction then paint brush is going this direction so means like a line then this way this this like this so it's like a turtle actual turtle with a paint brushed on his back this kind of thing right so you just have to import this Turtle module and all the methods and functions you will get you can use all the methods and functions of this Turtle Library which we will use to create our shapes and drawings and everything right now first let's check if this is installed on your PC like in your python or not this Library so how to check I'll show you okay so uh let's create a new project rather than creating a file we creating a new project right and the name I'm giving Turtle project so here we have a turtle project and in this project I'm going to create now a new file turtle1 dopy but first let me just check if you have this uh using that on command prompt if you want to check then how you have how to check what is the command so you just have to search for command prompt CMD and here do you have have python in your PC so if you want to check the version then how you can check python Das Dash version so I have python 3.1.8 right so three is like major minor than patch this is that you can say that pattern now I want to check I have this module or not so how to check just have to use Python hyphen M module and module name is Turtle so see if this command will give any error then it means you don't have this Library preinstalled so you have to install it separately right for that also if you're getting any error I'll tell you we'll make a separate video but see right now I have this kind of thing so yeah I have this Turtle Graphics python Turtle Graphics it's kind of a virtual canvas and on this this drawing and all maybe you think that it's not showing any turtle and all so it's showing this Arrow but yeah this arrow is like a virtual pen or a turtle we can change the shape of this arrow that Al I'll show you but if this kind of things if it is showing then definitely it's preinstalled and you can just import it and you can just use it right so now see as you can see here we have multiple Turtles on this canvas like one turtle is chasing another turtle there are many turtles so this thing also we can do we can create multiple Turtles on a single screen right now how to use this thing let me just show you so first if you want to use any method or any function of a preinstalled library or a module then you have to import that module first so just import name of the module is Turtle see it's case sensitive python is case sensitive so you have to be very careful it's turtle in small case it's not like that if you write down capital T turtle and if I run this then let me just show you what kind of thing you will get see module not found error no module name Turtle right so you have to be very specific while writing the names and all it's small T see it's not giving any error now right now import totle means now we can use any functions or methods which are in this Turtle module right okay now see if I write down here so obviously you need a screen a virtual canvas right to draw something so there are also multiple ways I'll show you everything so there is a method see Turtle obviously to use any method or function from this module first of all you have to write what is the syntax the module name dot we have a see method as you can see get screen right let's run this so it will show you the screen okay let me just show you see but the screen was just blink and disappear so you have to hold that screen for that also we have like a turtle dot we have a method only one method I'm going to show you right now but one by one I'll show you everything right there are multiple ways to hold that screen so we have a method C exit on click so whenever you will click on that screen at that time only it will exit so let's run this now see it's a virtual canvas right and this arrow in the center by default it would be in Center so it's kind of pen for us or you can say it's kind of a turtle it's a turtle maybe you are thinking it's an arrow not Turtle but you can change the shape of this thing it's like pen for us right so when you you click here then it will exit fine okay now obviously exit on click would be your last method so after getting the screen if you want to move your turtle forward then how we will move Turtle dot we have many methods and things here so I'll show you one by one every method but simple one I'm going to show you in this video then in later videos we will be discussing complex one so forward we have a method forward see forward and bracket you will write down the distance distance in unit or you can say this distance would be in pixels so I'm suppos WR 100 so it is going to move your turtle forward 100 pixels right on the screen like one dot is one pixel then second dot second pixel like this right so 100 pixel now in which direction your turtle is heading head like my face is in this direction so I'll move forward means I'll move in this direction 100 steps right if my face is in this direction forward means I'll move in this Direction only 100 steps right so let's run this and I'll show you see now initially here was the turtle and then here is my turtle right 100 steps fine if you want to change the shape here so we have like uh we have a a method shape shape see shape and then you have to the name so turtle I want to change this to Turtle see now as you can see it's a turtle now so maybe you're thinking you how how do I know all these thing like forward shape and what should I give here turtle and all so obviously I don't remember everything few functions only I remember but what you need to do you don't have to remember everything and every method and everything here we have a python documentation just go there on Google you just have to search turtle python documentation and the first link is this turtle turtle Graphics right so there see using this we can make these kind of shapes as well Turtle star so here you here you will get the tutorial everything about Turtle see forward so this is like basic thing forward Left Right everything I'll show you so here you will get all the methods let me just show you see forward if you click on forward it will show how to use this Turtle dot forward and in bracket you have to give distance now here we have small form uh you can say short hand or small form of these methods like rather than forward complete you can just write down FD that is also same so Turtle Lo FD distance distance is a number integer or float right so it's move the turtle forward in the specified by the specified distance in the direction the turtle is headed so backward if you want to move the turtle to move move backward then there is three method you either you can write down backward or BK or back and just provide distance so here you will get everything every method right and I have also shown you that uh what shape method that also I'll show you this see Turtle State this is visibility this is appearance so appearance of turtle means shape this is a method shape Turtle Lo shape and the name you have to give here now what is this name what name you can give here so can I give name as equal to Jenny and it will change the shape to Jenny no there are some specific name only you can give and these are C you can give out of these names Arrow Turtle circle square triangle and classic right so first go through this documentation it's not like that you have to go through this documentation properly each and every method and all and then only just use tole graph and try to write down program no just write down start writing programs what you want to draw like a square for that what method you need like move Circle forward then you have to turn that Circle so for that you can check how to move Turtle forward how to change the direction like angle and all left or right and all practically you have to do practical parall okay so this is how you can use this shape so whatever method you need for your project you can just go to this documentation and you can just read out if you want to check what is the shape of my turtle then simply you don't need to provide any parameter here just have to use this shape and see turtle and it will give you shape it is not printing because obviously you have to print this right what shape your turtle is having see it's Turtle right because we have changed the shape to Turtle if you don't change this to Turtle then by default if you want to print the shape then it's an arrow and it's classic classic right so if I change the shape to Arrow then what shape you will get it see this is Arrow shape it's something different from classic one right it's an arrow so if you move forward then obviously Turtle dot we have see this BK back or backward either now this time let's suppose we use BK and 100 or we can say 200 let let's run this see it has moved from Center first of all 100 in forward Direction then backward 200 pixels right if you want to change the angle like I want to draw a we can say a square how you will draw so let's pause the video and try this out you have to draw a square let me just tell you first if you want to move the direction of that thing Turtle then there is one thing we have like turtle uh left and right we have two methods left and right so let me just rather than backward let me just use left suppose left and in left in bracket you have to give angle angle I'm just giving 90° or not 90 let's suppose give 45 it would be in degrees by default 45° let's run this see first it will move forward then it will change the angle to 45° as you can see it is tilted towards this direction 45° right if you want to move after that again in forward Direction then just again after uh you know doing the left again forward see 45° then forward like this if you want to move this to right direction then just rather than left you can just to write and just give angle rather than l f proper you can just write down short hand LT or RT if I after moving forward if I want to move the direction to right so RT and let's suppose give 45° and again move the direction move this forward 100 pixels by 100 pixel see I hope you got this why you are getting this kind of line right so now pause the video and try to draw a square right so to draw a square first move forward 100 then first let's change the shape to Turtle to get a feel of using this you know Turtle Library so let's change the sh to Turtle then move forward 100 then turn left or right so I'm just moving this left to 90° then again move forward same side would be same for square 100 then I'm going to move this again left LT 90° I hope you have done this then again move 100 then again left 90° then again move 100 I hope it would draw a square let's run this I don't know see it's a square right or you can do it by like turn right then right then right then also this also you can do rather than turning it to left right now your assignment is you have to draw see we have done with square so now you have to draw triangle right plus uh you can say rectangle and pentagon or maybe you can do hexagon as well so these simple shapes this is is your assignment you have to try these out because in next video we'll be discussing more complex type of thing right and see I have told you to hold the screen like there are many methods exit on click or maybe we have one more thing that is one method is done so this also will do same thing either you can write down this done see let's run this right so now just or we have one more thing one that that is main Loop this method is also there so let's run this it will hold the screen right let's just click on this exit but whenever you click on the screen it will not exit exit on click if you use this method then only if you click on the screen then only it will exit if you using main Loop or done you have to close this right okay but one more thing I want to tell you it's not necessary to call this get screen method right if you don't call this your program will run fine see maybe you think now we are not calling the method get screen then how we are getting this screen so this screen would be automatically created you'll get the screen automatically whenever you call the method which are associated with the screen and some screen methods are see we have these some screen methods window methods of turtle screen or screen on python documentation you will get so all these are screen methods see method specific to screen it's buy exit on click setup title these kind of and we are calling these methods exit on click we have called that thing right but we have called that thing also main Loop or done these are also screen events right so whenever you call these thing like we have called main Loop so automatically it will give you screen if you call here exit on click then also defin automatically the screen would be there if you're not calling that get screen method right you click on the screen it will exit so no need to call the that method get screen separately right and maybe you are thinking somewhere in videos you will get like after importing turtle you have to create a turtle object like Turtle T is equal to you have to call a class in this module we have a class turtle and you have to create this one to get a turtle right but separately there is no need to create Turtle object if you run this see now we are getting two turtle one is turtle one is Arrow because one is by default the arrow here and another object we are creating Turtle object so we can see here by default you can see here we have two Turtle object right so this kind of thing this this is what we are calling Turtle class and we are creating the object so this is what object oriented approach we are using so this approach we use when obviously this is more powerful than the previous one we were using we are not creating any Turtle object or anything because by default we were getting one turtle and that's it for us but if you want to create more than one Turtle 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 many turtles on a particular screen on one screen only then then you have to create those Turtles separately Turtle objects you can say right so in that case you'll be using object oriented approach so from the next video we'll be using object oriented approach only right we will create a turtle because maybe we will be want two Turtle three Turtle more complex drawing or animation if you will do then maybe for that or maybe are you know creating any game then also maybe you are maybe you need need two turtle one turtle is running one turtle is chasing like another turtle like this specifically if like if you want more than one turtle on your screen then we will use use that object red approach right otherwise simply for the demo purpose there is no need to create any Turtle object by default an an unnamed Turtle object would be created whenever you call any any method related to turtle and that is like forward Left Right whenever you call these objects automatically you will get a turtle and that's I have shown you we are not creating any turtle and still we are getting Turtle because we are calling these methods which are specific to Turtle methods Turtle right and no need to get the screen separately many methods to get the screen we have a screen class also right so from that class we can create a screen object and then we will use that screen object so this is how we can create our screen object right with this screen class this is also Al fine this will also show you a screen right now rather than this we can just rather than Turtle dot this we can just use S1 screen object dot exit on click see this will also work fine so there are multiple ways to get the screen and anything like to get the turtle to get the screen to hold the screen so so you have to explore these things we cannot discuss everything in here video practically I can show you all the methods and everything just go to documentation and explore all the methods right if you want to control the speed of the turtle so then obviously we can control the speed of the turtle and what is the method Turtle dot let's just first delete this thing and I want to control the speed so speed and in speed how to give this thing so obviously there we have a speed method see here Turtle motion here we have speed method so speed you can give an integer in the range of 0 to 10 or you can give a speed string now speed string is this fastest fast normal slow slowest so zero means fastest means if you give zero means there is no animation takes place mean that is fast test you cannot even see the moment right one three means slow six normal and 10 is fast right so you have to give between 0 to 10 if you give a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5 then speed would be Auto automatically set to zero right and these are the speed string rather than the integer you can give you can write down fastest fast normal slow slowest right so I'm just writing the speed one see as you can see the difference right okay S one is not defined so for here we have to use Turtle do exit on click see now it's slowest right we can also change the color but that thing we'll see next video how to change the pen color how to fill the color in that image and all right how to draw a circle okay let's draw a circle now we have a um method directly here Circle see Circle right so just give the radius here so radius is suppose 100 let's run this see because first we were writing here this thing speed one then forward left so four it will obviously one by one execute all the commands so it will create a square first then it will print the shape then it will print Circle so see as you can see after just printing the the square simply it will draw the circle taking a radius of 100 see this this distance is 100 so this is what you can say radius 100 and it will draw a circle right because we have move this this we have moved this Turtle for over 200 pixels so definitely it is we can say it is 100 and the circle radiuses we have given 100 so definitely this is radius of the circle and it is circle so this is how you can play with your game and you can you know draw different different kind of images and all or shapes so more about total Graphics we we will see next video right and there this is the simplest one we haven't used any object oriented approach we haven't created any Turtle object by default the turtle object was created only one object and the unnamed Turtle object and that we were using so in the next video from the next video we'll be using that object oriented approach we'll create we'll use the classes and objects we'll create Turtle object screen object and how to change the color and everything we'll be seeing animations and all right so now I'll see you in the next Tut then byebye it
