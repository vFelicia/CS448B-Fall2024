so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing file handling in c we have discussed basics about file handling why we need files what is a file what is a file pointer what is f open function right now in this video we will see how to write something to a file means how to write a character how to write a string how to write a number to a file there are many things we can do with file like we can create a file the file you know functions we can create a file we can open a file we can read something from a file we can write something we can append into a file and six modes are there in the previous video i have told you r w a r plus w plus a plus right so and the functions f open function like uh those functions which are you which are used to read and write something to a file like f put c f uh put s f print f f scan f f get c f get s all the functions so in this video we will see one thing one operation that is how to write into a file we will see that program properly here first of all we will see the logic here then i will show you practical also on my laptop right and here we will see three function for writing we use what writing into a file we use f put c f put s f print f all the three function and what is the difference between these you know uh functions all the things we will discuss one by one right but before they just want to tell you one thing if you guys are planning to take gate 2022 exam then i think it's only one month left so it's right time to start your revision and go for test series so here an academy is going to conduct all

box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's write down a program here i'm not writing the complete program like header file and all that we'll see when we will see the practical i'm just writing down the logic here so first of all see what is the case here this is a hard disk and whenever you execute like you're on a program this is a main memory so some memory would be allocated to that program in ram this is a ram volatile memory right so here suppose i want to write something into a file so two cases can be there first file exist second case is file do not exist don't exist both the case we will discuss right so if suppose file exists and in this already existed file i want to write something so what you need to do first of all we need to create a copy of or we need to load this file into this memory so you can say copy of this file here right and then this is what you can say buffer and we write in this buffer by writing some commands and that after that this would be updated to this file right if file don't exist we don't have any file here so first of all we are going to create a file then we will open this file open means one copy of this file to here in this memory that is what opening a file then we will write into this file and that would be updated here two cases can be they can be there right so both the case we will discuss here now see if you want to write something into a file means you are going to open that file into write mode right now first to access any file right to process something with this file to do something with this file we need a file pointer that we have discussed in the previous video right file type of content so how you will create that pointer in main function i'm writing like f y l e strict fp this is a pointer or you can initialize this pointer with null here right now we have created a file point that means here we have fb right so now this fp is going to point a file type of object in that file type of object we are having the address of this buffer and then we can coordinate with this file this is the process you know excel actual process that we have discussed in previous video right now how to create this file type of pointer and this file type of variable sorry and this fp is going to contain address of this file type of variable so this would be this process would be you know this would be created when we use f open function f open means simple terms we can say just opening a file so here we are writing we are using f open function what is the syntax first you will write down the file name i am writing suppose file name is abc.txt right or any file name you can take here i assume that this file is in the same directory where i'm writing the program right where we have this you know vs code editor so you don't need to specify the complete path i'm just specifying the name of this file if that file is some other location you have to specify the complete path like see then everything the director name and everything and after that the file name the complete path you have to specify right but here i'm specifying only the file name i'm assuming this is a file we have created already this file right now in write mode i want to open so now this will do what it will create this type of object right and it will open this file or you can say this file open means load this file the copy of this file here this is what simply opening a file and it will return the pointer to this file type of variable so where we are going to store that address in this fp this pointer now this fp is pointing to here right now see what is this w mode if file exists if file exist then the content of that file would be erased the previous content and it would be opened here the copy would be opened here whatever you will write that would be written in this file now means it's type of overwritten the previous content would be erased and now you can write down your fresh content if file don't exist then first it will create a file here then it will open that file here means load that copy of that that file into the main memory two cases can be there right for w w mode i hope now you are clear with w mode if file exists the content would be overwritten in it simply open the file if i don't exist first it will create the file then it will open the file right so now abc.txt file it now it has been opened here it is known and you can see we can call it a buffer now i want to write three functions can be there to write something f put c if put s f printf printf means simply when you write something to output screen so f printf means f means file you want to write something to a file same put c write a character to a screen but f put c write a character into a file put s means simply put s write a complete string on output screen right f s means write the string into a file that's it so now if you want to write down a single character we can use f put c suppose i am taking here i am taking a character i am asking from the user or i am simply writing here care ch is equal to simple character a i am taking and i want to write down this character into this abc.txt file so simply what you will do here you will write f put c what is the syntax that function name here simply the character the character is in this variable or you can write down this variable name ch and here what the file pointer name file pointer name is fp right you can only access this file with the help of this file pointer this is very important that's it now at last obviously we are going to close that file f close this is very important f p whenever you execute this thing a would be written to this file right i'll show you that thing also but or simply if you don't want to write down this thing simply you can write down here also a i am writing here directly so it will same it will write a there but single character if you want to write down a single character but a complete string if you want to write down then what you will do see or you can take you can take the input from the user rather than taking directly here simply you can just declare a variable ch and before writing this function here you can write printf enter a character you want to enter into the file scanf percentage c and ch right now you can write down here ch that that's it now if you want to write down a complete string like i am taking care str and i am taking jenny khatri this time i want to write down the string now f put c will only write down a single character so two cases can be there either you can use f put s simply what is the syntax f s here you will write that string like jenny khatri but that that is i am i have stored the string into the name of the variable is str so simply write str comma fp and that's it it will write down this complete string into this abc dot txt file simple or you can write down that string here also in double quotes you can write down here janik three fp that is also fine right if you want to you know use f put c here rather than f put s to write down a complete string then what can be the center what can be the syntax character by character we will write so you are supposed to write down a loop right half you can do that thing suppose i am writing 4 loop i is equal to 0 and i from here to from 0 to up to string length right so how to find out string length strlen function is already there just pass the pass down the name of the string and i plus plus first of all we are going to declare the psi variable also otherwise it will give error now in this loop we can use f put c simple str i and fp that's it this go loop is from i 0 from 0 to up to string length right string length means string length of this would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. 12 right in string length this function is not going to you know count that null character now string is nothing but it's like a null terminated character array by default compiler will terminate the string with the null character also right here we have a null character also so the string length is 12 till i becomes 12 it is going to you know write down str i means str first of all str0 str 0 we are providing the address so at str0 we have j so j would be written down the file which is pointed by this fp right and that is abc dot txt so first of all it will write down j then e then double and then y then space and this thing right so using f put c also you can do this thing next why we use now f printf function see a printf function is it is formatted output formatted means this is used to for a string or a character this is used for a mix data type like we can write down number also using f printf string also character also float also just you have to specify the format specifier percentage d percentage f percentages percent is c that is why it is known as formatted output function that's it i hope now you got it so now suppose i want to write down a number also and a string also so string we will take jennifer only and number i'll take suppose int a is equal to 10 i'm going to write 10 and janika three there so for that thing we can use f print of a single using a single f printf function we can write down number also string also just to have you have to specify format specifier now what is the syntax here f printf the function name here the file pointer file pointer is fp now format specifier first first suppose i want to write down a number so percentage d then string then percentage s to form specify here you will write down the variable first is for percentage d means number so that the variable name is a here we have this is what integer and now the string str comma str sti means we are passing the address of base address of the string that's it right so it will fetch the string and right into that file so within a single using a single function we can write down both the things and simply f close fp so it will write down 10 plus jenny khatri into that file and it will close that file i hope now you got what is this write mode what does f put c function what is f potence function and what is f printf function and the syntax of everything means now you can write down something into that file a string also a number also a character or a float some if you want to write down float variable that also you can take that float value and here you can just switch by percentage f the variable name if you are not taking means you are not you know taking the compile time initialization at runtime also you can ask from the user using printf and scan and that's it i hope that you can do that variation you can do yourself right this is for your assignment you have to do this thing and one more thing you need to take care like if because of something we are not able to in this f open function is not able to create or open the file which is already exist here right now what would be returned by this function in fp now we are having null right so before writing the logic you can check if f p is equal to equal to null simply you can write down printf no file right or some error is there whatever you want to print you can print that message and here exit means we are going to exit from there only if something is there in fb means the file has successfully been opened so the this fp is having pointer to this and now you can write down this thing so this is also very important so here also fpfp is equal to you can initialize it with null right so you can check this condition also now let me show you practical of this thing so now let me create a new file file write dot c right so now here i am writing in main first of all we are going to create a pointer file fp is equal to i'm initializing it with null right now here what you are i'm doing right i'm taking a character care ch is equal to a single character right i'm taking a right this thing i'll write in into the file so using f open function we are going to open this file f open and here what we will pass the name i am taking abc dot txt right in double quotes you are supposed to write down the name right and in comma i am writing this in w mode that also in double quotes so whatever address f1 function will return where i am going to store that address into file pointer fp right so right now i don't have any abc file on my that you know in that directory on the desktop i have a c program folder and there i store everything you know my programs have been saved c program so here we don't have any abc file you can see here right so if you will open this into write mode then this abc dot t dot txt file will be created first and then open i will show you right now i am going to check if fp is equal to is equal to still it is null then printf error i'm just printing error and exit right so if this is not the case then what i will do f put c and the character is in the variable ch comma where i'll i'll just write the file pointer name and after that f close fb right that's it so now let me run this first of all and i'll show you the file will be created there so let me just run this so for this exit one this ah directory sorry the header file we are supposed to include uh include stdlib dot h right now let me just run this again and this is successfully it has been successfully run and no output is there on the screen why so because the character will be in that file abc dot txt so now let me show you that file abc.txtc in my this c program folder here we have abc.txt file right and let me just open it and here you will find out a on vs code also you can open this file here only you can open this file see i'll show you this file here see abc dot txt let me open this abc dot txt and a successfully we have written the character here right now if put c is clear now rather than a character i am going to write down a string str and here i am taking the string is length is 50 is equal to jenny khadri or rather than taking this from the user i am going to ask right so this is the case here now here i am writing printf enter the string and just using get as function i hope you know how to use gettys function because we have already discussed and str the name of this variable right now how you will write down this complete string using f put c how you will write down we are supposed to write down a for loop here i is equal to because uh f put c will write down only a single character and i not equal to strlen string length string length of str semicolon i plus plus right now before using this we are supposed to declare first this eye before using it right and now rather than the ch now here we are writing str and in bracket we are going to pass i right that's it now let me run this again and see in abc already we have a character a but that would be overwritten now because we are opening in this uh right mode so now let me run this again and see what output you will get here okay this stl you know strlen function is declared in which header file string dot h so better to include that header file also because we are using predefined function right string dot edge now let me run this again now see after running it is asking enter the string so i am going to enter like jenny's lectures right and enter and now let me show you this file abc dot txt here you have you we have you will have jenny's lectures spelling is jay and why it's not a night it's okay but i hope you have got like a is not there now it's overwritten and now we have jenny's lectures right now see rather than f put c you can directly use what i'm just going to comment these lines out and i'm just writing f put s just pass the str the name of that variable you have taken and pointer file pointer and semicolon that's it now it will ask you enter the string let me just run this and see it is asking enter the string at this time i am entering uh i am viral on instagram nowadays i hope you have seen that video so now let me just run this there's nothing on the screen i am viral on instagram that is now in abc dot txt file c and jenny's lecture has been overwritten right that is i know when you are writing in w mode that content would be overwritten right if you want that the previous content is also there and one the next content is also there now new content you want to add so you are supposed to write down this you know supposed to open this uh file into append mode a that also will discuss now this is clear to you now we will use f printf function so here i am writing i am taking one more variable into a is equal to 10 so we will write down the number also and string also right or maybe we can take character rule so character c is equal to s right now enter a string okay rather than f put s we are using here f print f so in printf first we will write down fp then format specifier first suppose i want to write down the numeric value then i'll write down string then percentage c character right that is what is known as formatted output function so now just the name of the variables we have a then correct a string we are having in str variable then comma and ch semicolon that's it and if close we have now let me just run this again nothing would be displayed on the screen just enter a string and i'm right down here i'll write down jenny khatri and now let me just press enter and let me just show you the file abc dot x3 10 jennifer three and s right so i hope now this is clear to you how to write something into a file all the three function f put c f get s f printf and the w mode also right so i hope now this uh right mode and these three functions are clear to you as means how to write something to a file that is clear to you guys now in the next video we'll see how to read something from a file so i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
