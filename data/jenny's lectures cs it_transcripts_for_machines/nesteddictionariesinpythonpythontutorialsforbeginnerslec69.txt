hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language previously in previous video we have seen uh basics of dictionaries like it was like introduction to dictionaries what is a dictionary why we use dictionary how dictionary is different from list apple and set some builtin function with the help of program we have seen and after that we have done one coding exercise as well right grading system right now One More Concept is what nested dictionaries or nested lists and dictionaries you can say we can list we can Nest our list into a dictionary and as well as we can Nest a dictionary into our dictionary okay what is the meaning of this thing I'll discuss this thing in detail but little bit about nesting of dictionaries and list we have discussed in that video also when we are discussing uh introduction to dictionaries like what does dictionary in python in the previous video now in this video we'll see in detailing what is a nested dictionary how to access elements of an insta Dictionary what is the syntax how to write down a Next Fitness to dictionary now what is the meaning or you can say how this nested nesting of dictionaries are useful the application of this thing right some builtin function that we how we can use those builtin function on nested dictionaries right this thing we'll be discussing in this video with the help of program okay now see what is the meaning of this nested dictionaries nested means nested dictionary means dictionary within a dictionary that is simple nested dictionary right a dictionary can contain another dictionary that can contain other another dictionary that can contain another dictionary right to it to an arbitrary depth we can say so multiple level of nesting is also possible right I hope you are getting simple nesting is what a dictionary within a dictionary that is nested dictionary that's it what is the syntax see simple dictionary how you will write like key and value suppose key one value one key two value two this is a simple dictionary but if the keys rather than simply these values are maybe like integer or numbers or anything which can be modified right if we write rather than value here I am writing another dictionary here also I'm writing like maybe it was one more dictionary so rather than simple values in keys I am writing another dictionary so this is what this is a dictionary suppose the name is so data this is a dictionary and within this we have two more dictionaries so this data we can say it is a nested dictionary because it is containing more dictionary and rather than this suppose we have E3 and here I can have list nesting of a list within a dictionary is also possible as we know nesting of a list within a list is also possible right so this is what you can say Panda of nested kind of thing nested dictionaries and nested list now how to Nest a dictionary within a dictionary how to Nest a list within a dictionary how to apply those builtin functions on this nested dictionary how to access the data of this nested dictionary right this thing will be discussing with the help of a program practically I'll show you right and say I've told you this nesting can be of multiple levels like within this dictionary suppose this in this I am having like suppose within this also I have a key one and that key is also a dictionary E2 value 2 comma see this is the dictionary within this I am having this dictionary and within this dictionary I am having one more dictionary so this can be your two up to multiple levels within this dictionary also we can have a one more dictionary I hope you are getting this is what you can say level of nesting this can be up to multiple levels right okay now let's see this thing with the help of program okay so let's create a new file here and what we are discussing nested dictionary so nested dictionaries dot p y right simple example we will take first of all what we will do dictionary same we will Nest a dictionary within our dictionary right let's take we have a dictionary we are having a student data the name is student data and this is the dictionary so here either like in the previous case we have seen we just write down here the key like name and value is like suppose Ram okay then maybe age then roll number and course like this key and value pair but rather than k n value pair at this point of time we are having these values not as a string but these values should be dictionary right okay so now key I am taking suppose name of a student roll number or anything you can take or one two three also you can take any integer it's up to you so RAM and the value I am taking in the form of dictionary like one student the information of that student now name of the student is I am taking as a key and here I am taking roll number first key and then roll number is suppose 10. then comma then I'm taking like age and age is suppose uh 20. and then I'm taking suppose opted is suppose python right so see this is another dictionary same here comma then for second student suppose I am having one student Mohan I am having the same information is 20 then age of Mohan is like maybe 22 and courses let's suppose C plus plus or let's suppose Java like this so this is what nested dictionary we are nesting a dictionary within our dictionary right okay now how to access this thing if you want to print this thing let's simply print print student data let's run this see RAM and this is one more dictionary then Mohan second key and this is value is in the form of dictionary right now individually if you want to access like student data and for Mohan only I want to access so just provide the key name Mohan in bracket and C this will get if you want to access only mohan's age or mohan's roll number so first pass like student data let's print print then the name of the dictionary student data then first subscript pass name of the key Mohan and in second subscript Mohan then roll number so roll number this I want to print let's run this see first a student data Mohan the record of one will be printed and next only the age of Mohan sorry roll number of movement roll number of 1 is 20 so 20 would be printed so this is how you can access right if you want to add like I want to add roll number sorry phone number of Mohan how you will add we have have to add we have discussed this thing just name of the dictionary student and pass the key Mohan right now in Mohan within Mohan this is one more dictionary so in this dictionary I want to add phone number so one more subscript and there what you want to add phone number just write down this thing and equal to what phone number you want to add nine eight seven six like something like this and now let's print student data and just I'm printing student data data of Mohan okay let's comment comment out first this line and this also now we are modifying nested dictionary so let's run this C here we have added phone number as well so if you want to print one data so it will show course age roll number and then phone number also this is how you can add if you want to add something if you want to delete from nested dictionary that is also possible suppose I want to delete Mohan or phone number Mohan is not interested to you know provide his phone number so let's delete the phone number of Mohan particular so student data then directly you cannot write down phone number here suppose I am writing here if you want to delete phone number you say maybe you are thinking Del name of the dictionary and phone number just write down this thing but let's run this see it will give error key error phone number because here you are providing the keys of student data right and in student data this dictionary we are having only two piece RAM and Mohan these are keys of student data dictionary RAM and Mohan and this roll number age course these are keys of this dictionaries dictionary name is Ram roll number age course these are keys of this dictionary Mohan right so student data dictionary is not having any key phone number right this Mohan this dictionary is having phone number because we have added this thing for number right so if you want to delete first provide the name of dictionary Mohan this thing then second subscript phone number right and then if you will print uh sorry the student data of Mohan let's run this in first we are having phone number and after deleting phone numbers agent course this is how you can delete and with pop also we can delete but if you want to return return the value whatever value have deleted if you want to return that value if you want to print that value then use pop function if you don't want to return if you don't want to print whatever you have deleted just use Dell function I hope you got the difference between Del and delete so if you see this Del will not return anything but if you want to return if you want to print whatever value you have deleted then use pop function so pop function how we will use rather than Dell suppose I'm using pop functions or student data Mohan from this dictionary I want to delete phone number so first student data provide the name of the correct dictionary Mohan then Dot pop and within this pop you have to provide what key you want to delete I you want to delete phone number so let's provide this phone number now you can if you print this thing so Pope will return the value whatever value it is going to delete it will return that value and after that we'll print data of Mohan so see first without deleting this print statement then we have executed pop function phone number so it is going to return this phone number pop function is going to delete now after deleting just print Mohan data and there is no phone number right so this is how you can remove if you want to delete something from here right if you want to add access remove delete I hope you got the basic idea of nested dictionaries right now if you want to Nest a list within a dictionary how we are going to Nest that thing see let's just comment out this code and now we are nesting a list within a dictionary right suppose okay we are planning a trip to Gujarat so suppose take this example travel data this dictionary I am taking and within this dictionary now I am going to Nest a list so I'm going to Nest like in Gujarat in the state which cities or which places we are going to visit right so the key is state name and there here a list of places we are going to visit like the list of places we are going to visit right and let's take another state in this state also if we'll go we are going to visit maybe like which like this right so this is what a list this is also a list so we are here this is the example of nesting our list within a dictionary so let's print this if you print this travel data simple travel data let's run this yeah my mistake here definitely first item then comma then second item this is a syntax error let's run this now see Gujarat and list of places Rajasthan and let's talk places it is going to show you right so like this in the in values we can write down list and dictionaries as well rather than just numbers and strings okay now within this see within this list also we can have one more list that is also possible and within this list we can have one more dictionary also so this is a level of nesting you can try this out now this example of nesting of a list within a dictionary but we can also nest a dictionary in a list or if suppose if you want to access like okay now if you want to access Rajasthan this this values of Rajasthan the places that we are going to visit when we go to Rajasthan is then here in bracket just pass the value I mean the key value of Rajasthan so let's print this it will only print Jaipur and udaipur we are going to Nest we are going to nest what uh we are going to Nest dictionary within list okay so same example we will take lights let's just remove the comment of this thing so here we are having dictionary within dictionary but I am going to have dictionary within a list so this should be a list so just remove the curly bracket and square bracket so this student data is now a list and this should be now dictionary so now this will give error because the syntax this is what key and value pair and the syntax is of dictionary but the student data is in our list and a list syntax is what simply in bracket like one two three or if you want to add string then Jenny if you want to add one more list then also possible three comma 4 like this so this is the syntax of list no key and value pair we can add list within a list is also possible but this is not as much useful useful as we have list within a dictionary or dictionary within a list or dictionary within a dictionary that is more useful so nested dictionary is basically it's a great way to store and represent structured information right because we are placing the data we are you know putting the data in the form of key and value pair so more structured in more structured where we can put data in a dictionary like we have in a real world data arrangement in the same form we can put so that is more useful okay now let's remove this thing and put the correct syntax so rather than this key we will add in this dictionary one more e n value pair name and name is RAM comma okay and remove this one now move on remove this key and as a key value pair just add this thing name and Mohan roll number let's say this now that's fine we are having two dictionaries within a list okay now if you want to access let's delete just this thing now you know we can access the list values with the help of index we don't have to provide any key because the list is not having any key so print student data if you simply print this thing student data let's run those so it will give a list of two dictionaries okay now student data at zeroth index what is that zeroth index that I want to print so at zeroth index we are having information of ram at one index we are having information of Mohan so that it will print if you want to if you provide index 2 it will give error index out of range because there is no to a second index only two entries we are having so zero and one index like this is also possible dictionaries within list right and for better understanding you a simple convention is you can write down how a list then dictionary and within this just add these things something like this so this is one dictionary then comma then this is second one so this I think would be more readable right this is simple convention just to make the data more readable so this is a list student data in which you are having first dictionary this one second dictionary this one okay now I hope you got what are nested dictionaries how to Nest a list within a dictionary how to Nest a dictionary within a list and all and multiple level listing is a multiple level nesting is also possible suppose this is a list within this we have a dictionary and within this dictionary I want to add a phone number and phone number phone number in the form of list like two phone number Mohan is having two phone numbers so something like this one is this comma second is this sorry here we have come so this is what again a list within a dictionary so multiple level of nesting so if you want to print phone number of Mohan so simply student data index 2 and there just provide the name the key phone number because this is dictionary so phone number is the key and let's print this okay list out of index because it's not 2 indexes one let's run this C Mohan phone number at index one we have this dictionary in this data and within this dictionary I want to access the phone number the value of this key phone number so it will give this thing the list of list of phone numbers so I hope this is not almost confusing if it is okay just take a break and then try this out with different different examples right because based on this only we will be discussing one coding exercise in next video based on this we'll take this example only the student data so I hope you heard what is nested dictionaries and how to Nest a list within a dictionaries and all right now in the next video we'll see one coding exercise based on this video only based on this nested process nested Funda will see one more exercise in the next video now we'll see in the next video bye take care
