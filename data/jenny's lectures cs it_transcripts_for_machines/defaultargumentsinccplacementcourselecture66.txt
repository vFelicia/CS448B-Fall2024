hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the c one C programming language we are discussing functions in C uh have discuss till now you know in functions introduction to functions and then have to first parameter in function like value and right a small topic that I was about to mention in previous video but I forgot that is default argument value default arguments right so it's a small topic but yeah it's important one so this thing see in this video what are default arguments how to fast and when to fast them some ADV of using default argument some draws with proper example I'll show you right so let me just tell you just try to relate this with a real life example suppose see I generally eat two chapati daily right so my mother know that I eat two chapati so she make only two the for daily right by default I don't need to tell her every day like I want but if someday if I'm more hungry and I want te then specifically I mentioned that I on that right so on that day that default value two is overwritten by the value provided by new right so this kind of thing so generally uh when we deal with these projects and programs also so generally most most of the time most of the cases values for some argument are soon right like maybe rate of interest 10% or any any of most of the time supp rate of interest is so you don't need to tell every time that 10% rate of interest 10 you just give that default in the fun right or like this text when you Cate text and suppose in my company most that having 6% 10% 12% so by default the text rate for that is 12% that in that category so when you calculate that some for those by default that text 12 right so in those cases default arguments are needed you don't need to pass those arguments again and again just pass default argument but how to pass default argument when to pass these default arguments when to you know Define these default arguments right this thing we'll see in this video so let me just show you this with one example I hope you uh now know the difference between argument and paramet arguments when we call a function then the actual value you pass those are known as Al and parameters are those variables that we take it those function definition or in function declaration at that time those variables are known as parameters let me show you the single exam so let's cre a new file here so here we have let's take a simple uh example any example you can take see when I was uh working in that PJ then I I I used to teach civil and mechanical so in my class there were you know void so tech there was only one girl and civil there was only four or five girls so suppose if this is the case so I want to write the name of every student using a function then if all are boys then I'll pronounce like Mr Right and if there is a girl then miss so by default you can pass that prefix value Mister right while greeting those students let me show you this thing with example I have a function suppose greet and there we have you have to pass string name and I have string prefix means Mr message or doctor or any prefix you want to apply so suppose two thing I have only name and prefix right and this is declaration so you can omit this name and prefix just provide string and string that is also fine just data type right and in main I'm calling this greet I'm just passing like any name Rahul and uh Mr prefix is Mr Mr Rahul right and then just Define it so these are parameter here these Rahul Mis these are arguments and in definition or in declaration I'm taking name prefix name prefix these are variable sorry these are these variables these are known as parameters right or formal formal parameters and these are known as Rahul M these are known as arguments or actual parameters right so I'm just printing C out like high and whatever the prefix right and then name so either we can use this only and name or we can concatenate this concatenate with one space and concatenate plus name right this way is also fine if you're using like class the string so better to include specifically that string head it's always a good to use string H file if you're using St right now this in this main after successful completion it will return zero and this GD is returning nothing so the DAT type is return type is vo right let's R this here we are not using any default value we are providing both the values Rahul mister and all right let's run this so see hi Mr Rahul let me just decorate it a little bit with the space right so now if in my class I have 60 students and all are 59 are boys and only one is girl so rather than passing every time Mr here suppose I pass uh I call this function again like another student bod and name is bod and Mister so same let's run this and see Mr Rahul Mr B so every time you are passing Mr right so in most of the cases this argument value would be Mr Mr Mister so rather than repeating this again and again just pass it as a default value now where to write this as a default value either in declaration or definition but but it's always a good practice to write to provide default values default argument values in declaration or prototype not in definition right you can provide it in definition right but in that case if you're providing default value in this function definition then function definition must be before function calling right it's always a good practice to I'll recommend to use this thing default values to provide default values in function prototypes so function this string prefix default value for this I am going to provide is equal to always m not always most of the time M because I have one girl in my class so for that I'll you know use a miss right so here no need to provide this argument value for this argument let's run this and see what output you same hi Mr Rahul hi Mr mode so we this is default argument so default argument is a value automatically assigned by the compiler if while calling the function you don't provide any value for that argument for this we are not providing any value so it will take automatically assign this value to that argument right so this is default argument value I hope you got this but there are some rules see default if suppose suffix also you want to use so if I write something like this suffix and suffix would all be different every time like surname of each student is different most of the student so I cannot provide a default value so what do you think will it work suppose you think this Rahul it will take Mr for prefix and just provide suffix for Zo right but this time give see more than one instance of overloaded function we why so because while you're calling this function whatever you will pass those would be those values would be assigned to the parameters from left to right so in name in name Rahul would be a sign this Roy would be assign to prefix right but we have one four that is suffix so let's in definition also you have to change it suff after name just plus with space and plus what suffix will give that will be printed oftr see default argument missing for parameter three for parameter three default argument is missing because in this case this Rahul would be assigned to this name this Roy would be assigned to this prefix now it is expecting one more parameter one more argument for suffix and you have providing only two right so these values would be assigned from left to right so you cannot leave it like this default argument should always be at the end right if you want any default arguments then that will be in the end if you have provided here default argument then after that all the argument or all the parameter you write here that must be default you cannot take any this argument positional argument here right so for this you can fix this ofix is equal to just provide a space so for default it's space right now it will run same thing but it will give now hi Roy Rahul see and Mr Bol why Roy Rahul because I am just printing High then prefix and in this case prefix is Roy Roy and name is Rahul right and no suff suffix is like space on and if I call this for like greet and I think the name of that girl was shrishti and now prefix is Miss right and suffix also suppose I'll give I don't know her surname so let's use Kumari here okay let's run this and see hi Miss sishi Kumari Mr binod hi Roy Rahul so let's delete this right so these values default Val Val are overwritten here right this rather than this mis now for this function called prefixes Miss right so these are not constant argument because the values can be changed the values can be overwritten if you provide your specific value then default value would not be used right your special value your specific value you provide that would be used while calling right so in this case if you want to provide Rahul and Roy for suffix then you cannot provide here Rahul and simply Roy you have to provide Mr also for second argument and then you can write here like Roy now it will work fine see Mr Rahul Roy right so I hope you got the this uh the fun of uh default arguments so this question is for you you have to solve this what would be the output of uh this thing pause the video and try this out and uh write down the answer in comment section see here we have first of all control will go to the main function then we are calling the sum we are passing three uh argument one to three so before it it will check where it is defined but it is defined after that but yeah it has a declaration before calling so that's fine in declaration we have 1 2 3 three parameter but one is default for third one I'm providing value zero right and return type is in so now it will go to the definition part and x y z three are argument we have sorry three parameter we have here we have parameter x y z are parameters 1 2 3 are arguments and return X+ y + z right so here it will it will call the sum function with 1 2 three value default value is zero for Z but it will it will use three in this case in second case we are only providing one value some one so it will give error why so because one will give will be given to X for y we are not giving any value yeah for Zed we have default value but but for y we are not giving any value right so it will give you error to few arguments in function call right at least you have to pass two argument because one two two parameters are not default only one is default so it will give error in this case you have to provide at least two this Su three four see that will work fine because X would be three y would be four you are not giving any value for Z it's okay we have default value zero right so let's run this and see what output you're getting here okay we have Mr semicolon here see 6 six and seven right six six and seven right other than zero also you can take any value but after this you cannot take something like this or if you modify it a little bit for second argument you give default value for third not you're not giving any default value in that case let's run this and see what error you are getting default argument missing for parameter three in this in sum for parameter three for this so after providing the default argument after this if you have any parameter that those all the parameter must be default so you have to provide a default argument after this default argument can be at the end right like in the tail of the parameter list default argument should be in the tail of the parameter list right so just by adding any default argument you can just increase you can just you change the capab capability of the function right just by using a default argument and you have to write down less code right the program would be easy to write so it helps in reducing the size of the program also but execution time will be a little bit more because if you're not providing any argument value for this then the compiler has to copy that default value to this parameter right so execution time will be a little bit more right I hope you got now what are default argument values or default values these are not constant values because you can overwrite these default values and rather than in declaration we can have have default value here as well but in this case it will give error because if you are using this default value in function definition then function definition must be before function calling right you can just change it and you can just run the sensing right so that's it for this video now uh in the next we'll see maybe some coding exercises on based on functions right so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
