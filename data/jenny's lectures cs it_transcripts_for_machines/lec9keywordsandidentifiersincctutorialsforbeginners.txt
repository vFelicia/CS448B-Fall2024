so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language in the previous video we have discussed constants and variables in c plus plus in this video we'll talk about keywords and identifiers in c plus plus see these two are very important part of a c plus plus program you cannot write a program without these two things keywords and identifiers you cannot write down even a simple program that program to print hello world without using keywords and identifiers right so these things are very important you can say building blocks of uh c plus plus program so i'll show you these things i will discuss first of all keywords and identifiers i'll show and i'll tell you what are keywords what are identifiers and we'll also see some important facts about these things especially about keywords right that i'm damn sure 95 of you guys don't know about these facts right so this video would be really very helpful for you guys and i'll show you more precisely if i say i'll show you these facts on my laptop now while writing a program i'll write a program i'll show you these things all the interesting interesting facts all the points about keywords and identifiers right so now first thing we'll discuss what is identifier see in this program in a this a you will call it as a variable name right so this is nothing but identifier if i take a function in this suppose i am taking a function void display and we will define this function here suppose i am writing c out hi right and before this function we will call this function here display before calling you have to give what prototype or you can say declaration of the function void display that's it right so if i i'll ask what is this display you will say its name of the function name it is name of variable it is name of a function if i declare any class something like this class and my class name i am taking my class and here we will take data members and member functions so my class will say it is name of a class so these are nothing but identifiers identifier is what you can say just a sequence of characters that will form a name user defined name whatever user defined name we will you know give in a program those are identifiers it can be name of a variable name of a function name of class name of object name of namespace name of any function or what we can say name of macros any user defined name you take that are nothing but identifiers simple so this is identifier this is also identifier this is also identifier name space name that is also identifier right if you if you will create a object of this class suppose i am taking um how to create object the name of this class and name of the object suppose i am taking m so this m is what name of object so this is identifier nothing but identifier right so some rules are there to form uh these uh identifier because these are just user defined names we give to anything in a program so same rule that we have discussed in variable like identifier can contain letters a 2 z a 2 z digit 0 to 9 and underscore no special characters are allowed it must start with either a letter or you can say this underscore cannot start from a digit right and you can say space is not allowed between these between suppose i am taking my class this name so you cannot take my space class this would not be valid right yeah my underscore class this would be valid you can take underscore right that is valid space is not allowed right any special symbol like comma dollar hash these are not allowed while forming the name of an identifier rules are same as the rules of you can say uh as we have discussed rules of naming a variable almost same right so now what about the length of a name identifier name how many characters you can take long length of your name like only genti gente khatri namjanti country lamba length of the name how many characters you can take so specifically c plus plus do not impose any restriction on the length of the name but generally first 30 31 characters are considered as significant right so first 31 character name can be and a name can contain 31 characters right so now this is i hope you go to what is identified right now what is a keyword see keyword or reserved word you can say or reserved word means have some special meaning to the compiler and these are written in small letters we cannot use keywords as identifiers right so iron if keywords are having some special meaning to the compiler they are already reserved they are already defined compiler know the meaning of keywords right you cannot redefine those keywords this is the list of keywords in c plus plus we have in c we have 32 keywords so c plus plus is super set of c so those 32 would be in c plus plus plus some extra keywords are also there here right and some keywords for added in c plus plus 11 version then 14 then 17 then 20. so this is the list of all the keywords i think total 95 or 97 you can count these keywords i guess these are total 97 keywords right some are these some uh in keywords we have something like this a and d and or or you can say not or these kind of things not i think eq for eq and eq these are simply alternative of those operators like and operator logical or operator not equal to operator but rather than those operators we can use alternative something like this we can also write so these also comes in keywords they are having reserved words right so see now let's see see this program and how many keywords are there in this program generally we know keywords like int is a keyword right so in this program how many keywords are there if i say see int this is a keyword right or is this main is a keyword is include a keyword you have to tell these thing without referring to the list of the keywords you have to tell because generally 1999 students used to get confused in these things they think that main is a keyword they think that this include this is a keyword this io stream this is a keyword no the c out keyword no these are not keywords this you need to take care these are predefined identifiers two things are there keyword and predefined identifiers these are simple identifiers but predefined predefined means already defined have some meaning right so see if i write in my program if i write rather than a if i write in main equal to 10 and if i print value of main here i am printing main what do you think what output you will get here you will get 10 yes main is not a keyword see keyword or reserved words you cannot use keyword as identifier i have told you if main is a keyword then this would give error but main is not a keyword main is predefined identifier you can use it in your program as a name of a variable simple variable and it will not give error but i i'm damn sure 99 percent of you guys haven't tried this thing you can try this i'll show you on my laptop also there are some other predefined uh you know uh you can say identifiers let me just show you these things on my laptop then you will get it better i hope basic query is clear to you guys what is identifier what is keyword and list i i have already shown you i'll show you i'll show you again also that list okay let me create a new file keyword and identifier.cpp right and same i'm writing here include i o stream this header and int main and simply we are printing like end main i am taking is equal to 89 semicolon enter c out main and endn i hope you got the mistake i have done in the program as well as on the whiteboard right we have to use std namespace so before this i am using std and endl is also in which namespace std so we are writing this and now there is no error so see main we can take main as a name of identifier as a name of variable and it is printing 89 it will not give any error main is predefined identifier so here is a list of predefined some predefined identifiers i'm showing you so anything you can take if i'm taking here like not main again we will take int c out now let me just show you one interesting thing c out is equal to 45 right and maybe you will think rather than writing std here simply we can write map using name space although it's not a good practice to write this thing but still we are writing because i have got many comments rather than writing this you simply write using namespace std okay we are writing using namespace std right now it is giving error why so because we have take see out and seen these are also predefined identify these are not keywords so you can use it you can use these thing as a name of variable generally we don't use this thing but if we use then what happens still i'm using this namespace std but still this c out would be considered as c i hope you can see this whenever i'll move cursor to c out it is showing int c out it is not considering the c out from this std namespace it is considering this considering this c out this intc out the variable that is why this endl is giving an error right so what we can do if suppose i write here so std this thing and i am going to comment this using namespace std now it is fine it will not give any error and endl is also from std right so you can write down this thing now this is clear to clear to the compiler this c out is from std namespace this is the object cnc outdoor object it is from the o stream header file right so that is why sometimes it is a good practice to use this std whenever you write down c out like std colon colon c out rather than writing using name space std see i have written this program using namespace std but still it was giving error because i am taking c out as a name of variable generally we don't take and we should not take these thing as a name of variable but just i want to show you all the cases right if by mistake we take this then what can happen so this can also be a thing in your program so better to use std see how these kind of things at this point of time if i print like if i print this see out see what output you will get 89 and 45 89 for main 45 for c out right but see if same like let us take example of a keyword else is a keyword so if i take else if i want to take else as a name of variable then it will give it because keywords are reserved words you cannot take keywords as a name of identifier right see it is giving error expected an identifier here you should take an identifier but else is a keyword but the c out main io stream include c in these are some predefined identifiers you can use these as a name of variable as a new function right but we should not do this thing this can give you know conflict in your program as i have shown you here c out if you take as a name of variable then if you don't use here stdc out if you use here using namespace std still it is showing error it was taking c out as in c out not from std not that object right so you can take like include as a variable name iostream as a variable name rather than it you can take float also so you just try out these things right and see the reserved word that i have told you like and and underscore eq these 11 are reserved what but these are not essential when we use ansi character set then we have corresponding operator for this thing and operator we have operator we have no not operator we have so we can use those operators rather than writing a and d and oro but you can use this also these are not essential but you can use if you want to use right keywords and identifiers is clear to you those who already have the knowledge of keyword and identifiers simply i'm damn sure definitely they have you know got something new some new effects from this video right so now i'll see in the next video maybe the next we will discuss namespace right so i'll see in the next video till then bye
