hi guys welcome back in this video I am going to discuss with you how to find out longest common subsequence from the given strengths because sometimes they ask you in net exam they'll give you two strings and they'll ask you find out the common longest subsequence okay see as the name suggests it should be the longest subset budyonny two common common means two obviously two strings would be given or misako commonly Callahan what a subsequence subsequence is basically what you can say it's a sequence of strings or sequence of characters from a string okay and this sequence of characters would be in increasing order with respect to their position C let us take an example simple example suppose we are given one string W and it is having a b c and d these are number of characters in this string this one is one string now we are supposed to find out subsequence of this string okay subsequence you can write number of characters of these strings in increasing of increasing order of their value with respect to their position okay in their increasing value like a be this one is subsequence of this string we can write BD this one is also subsequence of the string subsequent number of characters obviously BD number of characters say in increasing order with respect to their position increasing order means C becomes before D or you can say D comes after D can we write C a no we cannot write this is not the proper subsequence see a CC comes after a though it should be AC this one is not right because this character should be in increasing order with respect to their position okay dope electric about Polly helices eige in the subsequence you can also write ad this one is also write a or D but we cannot write D B D and B we can write B D this one is not true b and b d and b okay d b k bar i got the sequence maybe BK bad he and hid okay also you can write a C and D this is also write a C and D B C D this one is also write ABCD obviously this is also right okay so how many number of sub sequence can be possible that is 2 raised to power n n is here 1 2 3 4 that is 2 raised to power 4 that is 16 number of subsequent SAR possible from this string now suppose one is given this one is w1 and this one is w2 I'm just taking simple example and w2 mayhem re pass here simply BC and D ok and you are supposed to find out the common subsequence longest common subsequence from w1 and w2 ok now this is the simple example so simply by looking at this case you can see BCD would be the longest and common subsequence common that should be common between W 1 and W 2 its key subsequence is ko 16 apke BB ho sucker say you can write down simple one character also bc ho success CD be possible here BD be possible here and CD also possible BCD is also there so common in the autonomous in sorry sub sequences or in Mesa common yoga that would be the longest that is BC and B so sometimes they ask you some come they will give you some complex two strings and they ask you that what is the longest common subsequence of these strings so that at that time it is not possible that you find out all the sub sequences of all the strings and then compare what what is the longest subsequence okay because sometimes they can give you many characters so you can say seven seven characters to raise to power 7 many subsequent season here also maybe seven or eight characters than to raise to power 8 number of sub sequences are possible so it would not be possible for you to calculate all the subsequent of two strings and then compare so I'll give you one simple trick okay let us take one example let us take this example you are given two strings x and y X's ABA ABA and Y is B a B ba a and you are supposed to find out the longest common subsequence from these two strings so the previous method is find out all the sub sequences of these and these and find out the common one but that is not possible because to raise to power one two three four five six six characters are there to raise to power 6 to raised about six number of so you can say the sub sequences would be there and that would be very timeconsuming though another method is just to draw a table like this okay to the you know one side will write X and another side will write Y in this example we I have written X the string at this side and Y string this side you can also write X this side and why this side first row and first column would be 0 and 0 that is iid noted with this this this mark that is nothing is there negation or you can say something like that take care this 1 will be 0 and 0 or you can say Phi and Phi okay here I have written X X is what a B a a B a and at this side I have written B a BBA and that is why every character would form one row and this side every character would form one call and you are supposed to fill out these entries now okay we can take this one is I and and this this side we are moving toward this side this one is variable J and this one is I okay now how to fill out these entries check see now you have to fill out this entry till this side check out at this side you know the what is the character corresponding to this row a and here what is the character from this string that is B a and B these characters are different not same a and B are different fine if these characters are different then how you will fill out this entry if these are different then you here you will write maximum of either this one or this one I'll just tell you the formula also after this after discussing this one how to draw the formula a be a poor simple stable minuteness maximum of this one or this one here also we have zero here also we have zero what is the maximum zero okay and whether you have taken this one or this one you have to draw an arrow now here we have zero and zero so you can draw an arrow this side and this side any side I am just drawing an arrow this side because I am taking this zero I am taking this value okay simply next fill out this entry corresponding to this one we have a and corresponding to this we have y is what a here also a here also a both are same characters if same characters are there then how to fill out this entry in that case you will fill out this one one plus one plus this value this diagonal value upper diagonal value here we have 0 then 1 plus 0 is what 1 only and how you have drawn this one from this 0 from this 0 we have taken this 0 and then we have added 1 then you will draw an arrow from this one to this 0 like that ok next one is this one a and B these are also not same other same thing in that case what will you do maximum of this one or this one which value is maximum out of this upon a fill Carnahan through this one and this one a Beck Eric Cooper out of one and zero which one is maximum that is one then you'll right here what one and error would be towards this one because we have taken this value fill out this one a and B these are also not same the same he hang that is what you will write down here maximum of this one with this one maximum is what one and we have taken this one from here only this one next is this a and a now this a and this a both are same in that case how you will fill out this value 1 plus the upper diagonal diagonal may up for the ignore one a diagonal my value K here 0 then 1 plus 0 is what one fine and we have taken this one from this upper side okay now this one a and B these are also not say 'mother same nahi token C value log a maximum of either this one or this one I'll call you half will karna Hathaway scooper yep it yeah Holly Yusuke maximum up core value Lanie a maximum after 1 and 0 which one is maximum one will write one at this place and arrow would be this side because we have taken this value 1 this box I got Apple Year Zero Laney hootiehoo arrow would be here okay so like this we will fill out this table next is next is this one you have to fill out this box corresponding to this one what is value of X B and what is character of Y that is BB and B are same are same high in that case what you will write 1 plus 1 plus diagonally up tekubi upper is box may yeah well you can 0 here and 1 plus 0 is 1 1 and the error would be APNIC on C value Li hey Cooper Valley then arrow would be like this towards zero our Valley zero yaw Malini next to this one corresponding to this what is B and upper is a both are different other different hand that case what will you take here maximum of either this one or this one a parabola box yes well a box key maximum arc of a linear one and one move each one is maximum or obviously one is maximum don't know same here okay now you can draw arrow either this side of the side I am drawing this arrow this side because this is also one this is also on the maximum of these two is one so you can take this one or this one fine now this place your outer fill out corresponding to this one the roll character is what B and here is we have B both are same if both characters are x and y are same then what you will write here 1 plus what is the value in upper diagonal diagonally up for the ik 9 upper diagonals that is 1 1 plus 1 is what then you will write here 2 and the arrow would be like this a pod side because we have taken this one okay this one now you have to fill out this one B and B both are same there say my in that case what you will do 1 plus diagonal diagonal up there could be upper side what is value of this books that is 1 then 1 plus 1 is what again and we have taken this one so arrow would be like this upper side okay now what should be here B and a and B are different different header you will take what maximum of out of this one or this one what is maximum of 2 and 1/2 is maximum then you'll write here 2 and we have taken this 2 then arrow would be like this towards this to whichever value you have taken the arrow would be towards that value here B and B both are same in case same and then 1 plus this diagonal diagonal value is what 1 is my OpCo vinet can have 1 plus 1 is what and the arrow would be like this diagonally value up neck here here have you'll fill out this place a and corresponding to this place what is value of that character of I string that is B a and B both are different different hey in that case you'll take maximum of either this the maximum of this or this one and zero maximum is what one and we have taken this one so arrow would be upper side this one you have taken okay okay now a and a both are same in case both are same then one plus this value diagonally upper value value 1 plus 1 is what 2 will write 2 at this place and the arrow would be like this we have taken this one okay a and B both are different in case both are different than maximum of this one or this one what is maximum n 2 is maximum both are same then we'll write it here you can write down the arrow like this one or this one because we have taken either this value or this value both are same I am taking this value suppose now arrow would be like this one this side okay like this you will fill out all the locations okay now after filling out all the places this is a table using that form alone okay now check out the last box the intersection of last row and column what is there for then this length of the common subsequence would be for you can find out by using this value last intersection value of this last row and column what is the value for then the length of that common subsequence would be for honest we have already we have find out this found out this length that is 4 but now you have to find out what is that sequence the number of character would before that is you can find out by using this value only but you have to find out now the characters what are those characters for characters for common characters okay in that subsequence now have to find out that place now you have to trace out we are at this place only we are starting from this place only okay now check out the arrows at this place where the arrow goes this side see this side okay now we are at this four only okay now check where the arrow goes to the diagonally diagonally upper side fine in case the arrow goes diagonally to the upper side then we will check what is the value what is the character according to this corresponding to this row a and what is the character corresponding to this column that is a then you'll write a if the arrow goes diagonally upper side when the arrow goes left or right left either this this in this row or either upward then you will not take the you will not write the character if the arrow goes diagonally upward then we will check out the character from the string X and by okay now from here we are going upward now we have reached to this three now check out this arrow this arrow is also going diagonally up or diagonally a poor now check out the character corresponding to this is row is B and column is B then we will write B and will write these characters from right to left from right to left half way other up man now we are going upward we are now at this place now here what where there goes to the here left side fine then in case arrow is going toward this side or toward that apples eye upward side then we will not write down any character now this side here then we'll go here on now we are at this place now the arrow goes upward see upward fine if arrow goes upward through corresponding to that box you have to check out the character in the row I also and the column will so that is a and a will right here now a and then we will jump upward then we are at this place only one and here check out where there goes straight upward will not write down any character because this is not diagonally upward where go we will go here only now the arrow goes diagonally upward see a curve corresponding to this diagonal now check out the character B corresponding to this box what is value of this in X string B what is characterized by string that is also B you'll write here B now you will go here then this one is what we have reached to or you can say here we have 0 no arrow is there because we have reached to that initial row and then this one is longest common subsequence see the length of this is 1 2 3 4 4 hair length and the longest common subsequence is Bab it is not like that this one is the only longest common subsequence see another one what could be there another one if if suppose example a thing if you have written this arrow not like this you have written this arrow like this upward direction because they see when you fill out this location then you will check out the character corresponding to this row that is a corresponding to this column that is B both are different in case both characters are different then you will take what value maximum of this one or this one either this one or this one maximum is water both are same then we'll write here for and which one you have taken either this one or this one first case we have considered we have taken this value but now we are considering that we have taken this value of poor value fine then to find out the longest common subsequence we would start our tracing algorithm from this place only and we will go upward here only now at this place check out the arrow position arrow can't arrive not diagonally upward diagonally upwards ser o ji we will check out what is the correct character corresponding to this row B and B then we will write here be fine then we'll jump diagonally upward if now we are here only check out the arrow this error is also going diagonally upward then we'll check out the character a and a here we will write a we have reached to at this place only now here arrow goes at the side we have moved to the side now arrow goes this side we have moved to the side now arrows diagonally upward if diagonally upward arrow chaga in that case you have to write down something in that output check out the character a and a will write here a and then we will jump a go in the direction of this arrow diagonally upward we are at one here only now here also arrow goes diagonally upward now check out the character B and corresponding to this what is string in X B and Y may be happy then you'll write here B okay and with my now we have reached to this place and there is no arrow because we have raised to the first row and column so this is also another longest common subsequence be a a B like this you can find out many common subsequences according to these arrow positions okay but length would be whatever the value in the last box corresponding to this last row and call that would be the length okay now this is how you can find out the longest common subsequence now the formula is what how do you fill out these you know these values what is the formula how will fill out fill out I'll write down the formula this is the formula using that formula we have we can you can fill out this table okay see here what is there if X so Phi is equal to Y of J here at their side we have I and this side we have J variable x and y X so Phi X so Phi and X of Y of J if both are same let us take this example a and a both are same then what we have done again in case the new characters same and then we have done what 1 plus 1 plus this value diagonally up or value then we have taken what see this one is goes to Phi J or you can say whatever we have written this here 1 you can say this one is weight or Coast then coast of I and J would be 1 plus diagonally upward 1 plus C of I minus 1 and J minus 1 okay at a stake this one is from 0 we are starting 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so at this at this box what is value Phi I value is 1 and what is value of JJ value is worth J value is what fine now this is a this is a both are X of I and buy of J are same then 1 coast of this I J cost of 1 to 1 n 2 we got 1 plus I minus 1 1 plus cost of I minus 1 I is got 1 1 minus 1 is 0 cost of 0 and J minus 1 J 0 2 two minus one is one cost of zero and one zero and one that is this one and we have discussed this one also one plus C I IB up cake whoa check out JB up car over I over then we will move to a port and J over then backward so one plus this one in case they owe same nahi otherwise otherwise what is the cost of C and J let us take this case this one a and B both are different then what we have taken maximum of this one or this one C maximum of this one this is what a got backward our way then I value is same IQ value of Q 1 here I agree but J key value K ho jayegi 1 which I get a maximum of CO Phi J minus 1 or you can say this one you happy jakey value up get through here Iggy but I here I looking for a gap key one say one second I will be 0 that is 1 or you can say C of I minus 1 and J see this is the formula you can draw this formula by looking at the stable only ok so I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
