hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing objectoriented programming in C++ whoops Concept in the previous video we have seen that was just about introduction to op like what is object oriented programming how op is different from poop what are some drawbacks and advantages of you know both the approaches po uh and op so that video was about po versus op fine now the very first thing you need to understand is if you are following this object oned programming approach then to write down a program you need to understand what is a class what is an object because without classes and objects we cannot write down any program in object oriented programming right so this is the basic thing you need to understand in this video we'll see that thing Al that thing only what is a class what is an object how to define a class how to declare the objects with some real life scenarios also I'll discuss this thing right I hope now you have the idea y o why because there are some drawbacks in that PO approach the main was we have discussed that data security there is no data security because we basically in po focus on procedure how to do the task basically on the functions we don't focus on data because data we declare many data globally global data is there and many I mean obviously global data all the functions can access that data so any function can modify that data so data is not secure right if one function has modified that data then another function is accessing that you know the data that has been already modified right but that function basically maybe uh that function wants the previous data so that would be some kind of inconsistent inconsistency in the data and all so there's no data security in po approach there are so many functions if you if you are using that PO approach for solving a large problem on a large project so there are maybe 50 functions 100 functions right each function is calling other functions right so they are interconnected with each other so it's very difficult to track which function is accessing which global data and all there is so much complexity in that case and data is moving freely so no data security is there why that is why we have you know we are now following object oriented programming approach although there are many other limitations also of this PO approach but one is this thing right other obviously we'll discuss one by one in later videos right I hope you got this this drawback of Po right now in op how the data is secure because whatever the data right and the functions which are going to perform on that data we B we usually bind those you know functions and data in a single unit basically now what does that mean let me just show you with the help of uh you know proper example here see suppose uh uh let's take because I have told you to solve real world problems or to for real world scenarios to model those real world problems in programming language we use op approach right we can easily model all the real world scenarios with the help of op approach right and why because of these type of concept we have in this approach see suppose let's take an example I have a YouTube channel right so basically what we need to run a YouTube channel basic three I mean these four things instructor editor thumbnail designer social media marketer right if you have a small channel so I mean if suppose I have a small channel so I am instructor I am editor only I design my thumbnails and I only promote my videos right now okay it's okay I'm everything here one man but what if I want to start many courses simultaneously suppose I want to start one Java course one web development course one like maybe python course one for from engineering and many courses so obviously I for the growth of my channel I cannot do everything right I cannot teach everything and can do all the things so what I can do is I can hire instructors right suppose one instructor for Java right now I have hired one instructor also maybe I have hired one editor right and social media marketer editor who is going to edit my videos as well as design my thumbnails so three person I have hired right now I am the manager suppose I'm the manager now I don't need to do anything so I'll just coordinate with these person right now I am the manager I don't need to tell the instructor how to teach I don't need to tell the editor like how to edit the videos I don't need to tell this person like how to you know do this uh marketing and all because I think they are they in this field they are better than me I guess right I don't need to go in detail of these task because they will do their task they'll do their job and they will like I just follow up right now see suppose instructor I have hired two instructor so these in instructors are having obviously some two things are there what whatever the instruct like he or she has and what he or she does two things are there has means like they obviously instructor like suppose I'm the instructor Journey so I have some name maybe address and I'm having has has you know laptop or not is equal to maybe true and has my account number and something like this I'm having some details with me right and what I do suppose I'm the instructor then obviously teach then maybe prepare quiz so these are the attributes or these are the obviously name address has laptop has account number and uh location and all these are what variables we can say simple variables we can take and what I do is we can do like these are functions I teach I prepare quiz or any other thing also I can do fine now in this case in this case we don't call these free like variables and functions when we are following this op approach we call these attributes and the functions are known as methods not functions methods why so because these are not freely moving in the program these things the name address and I can teach prepare these attributes and fun methods these are associated with the instructor suppose I am the instructor one instructor is Jenny so I have name I have my address I have this property I have like this attribute account number and all so these are associated with me that is why we don't call these variables and functions we call these attributes and methods because these are not free in that program not freely moving these are associated with a particular object like I am an object I can say Jenny so these are associated with the particular instructor right so basically these two things are there and second is structor may be suppose like G right so these things these attributes and these methods we just put these things in a single unit right because these are associated I mean these are related this data and these functions these are all one instructor like this and this is nothing but like an object right so Jenny G these are objects the actual real world entity these are known as objects fine so objects are important whatever we do here we will do you know using objects on objects that is why we call it object oriented programming not class oriented or anything else oriented object oriented because objects are very important the main thing is object then why class right class is like a blueprint to create objects like suppose I have that map for construction We have basically first the map of that building on a piece of paper right so that map is like a blueprint and the actual building you build those are objects many buildings you can build with the help of that one map if you don't have that map then also you can you know build buildings but that would be little bit you know difficult to manage and all right because there are so many uh persons while building that uh you know building so many like labor contractor engineer and many more and if one person who is the main having that map according to that that map he or she can guide every person like what to do next so that would be easy so map is like blueprint so here same class is like blueprint the design like we have idly maker right to make ID we have idly maker that is a design so with that help of those that idly maker you can easily you know uh cook those idlies quickly within 10 to 15 minutes right and you don't have that idly maker then maybe you can make idlies with help of some other objects but that would obviously take more time but if you have that design you can easily like I don't know much cooking but I have that idly maker and I can easily uh make it Le with the help of that right so that's the beauty of the design or the blueprint you have so same here like here class instructor is class so in instructor is just a blueprint we are not specifying any one person instructor is just general thing blueprint instructor will have every instructor will have some name address and these attributes and these functions right and Jenny and J these are objects these are actual things I mean you can say that real world entities these are objects like in a company we have many employees so employee is a class and the person you are having those are objects customer is a class and the customer actual customer those are objects right so class is a blueprint fine you can say proper definition class is a blueprint for creating objects and object objects basically we can say objects are real world entities or we can create objects from a class and from one class we can create many object now from this instructor class I can create many instructor like I can hire as many instructor as I want or as I can afford right Jen G prep Akash P many instructor of same with this blueprint right so every instructor will have name address these attributes and these two functions if you create object using this blueprint then these all these things would be obviously the actual values would be different because name of every instructor is different so every instructor is having its own identity every instructor is having different address every instructor has having like has laptop maybe true or false we don't know account number true or FS teach prepare quiz these two methods every instructor will have so every instructor will have its own Identity or like every object will have its own identity right so I hope you got this what is a class what is an object now how to define a class and how to create object let me just show you this thing how to define a class General Cent is simply use class keyword here it's a reserved word class and then the class name class name we write in Pascal you know naming convention right like this the uh class name first letter of every word is capital so this is Pascal convention so we CL we write class name something like this suppose I have class name uh instructor same let's take instructor let's just model this YouTube Problem YouTube channel problem in programming how to model this same we have class object concept so class is instructor in this block you can write down your attributes and whatever the methods you have right suppose I'm writing here so these two are attributes and this is method right of class instructor this is how you define a class whatever attributes or methods you want to take you just write down here and see we can say class is a user defined data type why I am saying this see as we know in C++ we have this string is a class right string is a class and if you write down here string I have written string name so name is an object of this class string right but this is like we find these classes in standard libraries these are already defined Vector is also class we can Define Vector something like this Vector here the data type suppose int and name of that Vector numbers so here number is it's like an Vector object of type Vector so Vector is a class right so these are what builin builin uh you know uh classes and we create object of these builtin classes fine but class this class is what this is user defining we are defining our own type and that type we are defining our own blueprint our own design right is having name this these attributes and this method and using this type we can create objects so you can say class is a user defined data type right so class basically binds attributes and or you can say the data and the methods together right and we can hide you can say class can also hide the data and the methods from accessing from the outside world using access specifies public private protected those we will see in later videos fine now how to create objects with the help of one class we can create as many object we want because see with the help of this string class we can create many string objects with the help of vector class we can create many Vector objects so same with the help of one class we can create many objects right so now how to create object of this class syntax say simple class name then object name this is the general syntax so here if you want to create class name is instructor instructor and here just your class name and then object name suppose object name I'm taking J that's it this is how you can create object of any class class name object name suppose another I want to create instructor and GM this is the second object I have created of same class right there is a second method with the help of new keyword also you can create object but that would be like pointer to object and uh I hope this is clear to you now second the uh next is what this is how you can create the name of the class right here the pointer estri symbol here the name name of suppose I'm going to create Jen equal to new new after that I think after new I'm going to write here name of that class again instructor and with this so this is the second method instructor estri the name of the object whatever you want is equal to new keyword and after new we have instructor instructor would be some supposed to be here but we don't have space so that is why I have I have written here instuctor this is pointer to object this will return a pointer pointer to object and this is going to create directly object this is pointer to object now what is the difference main difference is what this is automatic storage allocation right whenever this object is out of the scope the memory would be automatically deallocated would be freed automatically right but this is not like this you have to delete this object explicitly when you are not going to use this object I mean when this object is out of scope so how to delete this object you simply use delete keyword and the object name is j that's it so one is this you have to explicitly delete this and when you are creating this object memory would be allocated from the stack portion when you are creating object pointer to object using this method memory would be allocated from Heap section from dynamic memory allocation this is also another difference I told you memory we have like stack memory also Heap memory for dynamic memory allocation we use that Heap portion for static memory allocation we use stack portion so the memor is allocated for the JY from the stack portion and from here from the Heap memory Dynamic this is kind of dynamic memory location so this is pointer to object right but yeah we generally use this you know uh convention only to create objects because this is easy right if you want to use that object for a longer period of time you can use this thing with the help of new right but for a shorter period of time if you want to use then again and again you have to delete that memory explicitly and here you don't need to take care of that thing automatically a memory would be freed when this object is out of scope right so this is how you can define a class you can create an object of that class so basically you can say this object represents a specific instance of a class sometime somewhere object are also referred as instance object or instance both are same F and see with each object Jen G each object can use the defined methods the class method so here we have only one method teach so each object can use this method te each right now how to access these class methods class attributes with the help of object that thing we will see next video with the help of proper program and it's not like that we can create only one object like instructor Journey we can create array of objects we can create Vector of object as well see let me show you we have class instructor here I'm going to create not a single object array of my objects so the name I'm taking suppose instruct instructors see it's s and class name is only instructor instructors and array here you can give the size or if you don't want to give the size here only you can initialize suppose I'm writing object is Jenny G something like this now two objects I have created Jenny and G these are not strings these are not just name these are objects right so don't just put these in in these quotes right these are name of object fine Vector of objects also we can create something like this we have like vector and within this we use the data type int or whatever data type you want to use here the data type is instructor our own defined class so just write here instructor because this is the data type and here the vector name Vector name any you can any name you can like suppose names that's it right and you can initialize this also like prep and every operation you can do like push back operation suppose we have so that also we can do name is name of this Vector is names names dot push back and equal to whatever you want to push back I mean the value the name the name of another object prep is one object one object is maybe G or G we have already have so pile that we can do right so like this we can create arrays and vectors of these objects as well so I hope you got this if you have any doubt you can just let me know in comment section in the next video we will see like how to access these member these methods from these objects using these objects right with the help of proper program I'll show you right so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye bye take care
