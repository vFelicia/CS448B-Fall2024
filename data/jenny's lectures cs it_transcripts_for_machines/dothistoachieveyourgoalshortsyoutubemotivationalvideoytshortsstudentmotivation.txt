As we know everyone use to take Resolutions on New Year but 99% don't complete theirs so whats the reason?? lets take an example If you are a smoker and U decide to quit smoking from new year. That would be almost impossible but If you decide that from New year I will smoke on alternate days and then try it for 1020 days . After that once in a week then once in 15 days then once in a month. Like this within 34 months you will be able to quit smoking completely. Same goes to study suppose you decide to start study for 68 hours in a day. So you will not be able to do so form the next day only or may be you will follow this routine for 2 or 3 days and then you quit. So what you have to do to make it as a habit. Decide to devote one hour daily for whatever you want to do then gradually increase your time from one to two hour then three hour and so on.. Ultimately within 34 months this will be your habit of studying 68 hours daily. So set Short Term goals to achieve Long Term Goal.
