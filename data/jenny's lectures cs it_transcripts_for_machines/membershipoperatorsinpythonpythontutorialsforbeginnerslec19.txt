so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing operators in Python the last video we have discussed identity operators in Python so in this video we'll talk about one more operator is left that is membership operator so this thing we will discuss in this video everything about membership operator like what our membership operators and what are types of membership operator and I will show you with the help of program also so practical also we will see now see before going to this membership Operator Let me just ask you one question if I have a string suppose I have a string something like this I have Str a string is Jenny okay now in Python we can write double quote or single word if I want to check this y small Y is present in this string or not what we will do will that character is y we want to check this character is present or not right so one logic is what maybe we will compare this with every in a for loop with every character like is y equal to J no then e then compare with n n and then compare with Y yes Y is present then it will show yes so in a for Loop we'll write down this kind of logic right to check if this is present or not every character we have to check in a string but with the help of operator just to use one operator in Python and you can check this Y is present or not means we want to check why in this string is present or not Y in string yes so this checking this kind of thing we can do with the help of some operator that is known as membership operator in Python so there are basically two types of membership operator in and not in right so what we membership operators are used to check whether a character or a substring or a value or a variable is present in a sequence obviously this is a sequence of character in a sequence and sequence may be like a string or list or Tuple or dictionary or something like this set right although we haven't discussed like list dictionary Tuple and set but one example I'll take in this video Yeah string I hope you know what a string character of sequence of characters right so membership operator are basically used to check membership check for membership in a sequence membership of maybe a character or a substring or a value or a variable is present in a sequence or not right I hope you know I hope now you got what as basic use of these membership operator so two types of operators in and not in so in if I write something like this this is my string Jenny and I'm writing print and a character so that is why we use we will put this in single code Y in Str variable name is Str or directly we can say Y in gen directly we can write down this thing here right but we have taken a variable Str so Y in Str so this n operator will return in this case true because yeah small Y is present in this Str so in well return true if if that specified value is present in a sequence otherwise it will return false if I check here print n n y in Str so this is you can say a substring of this string n n y yes this is present so it will also return true if I write something like this print capital Y in Str this point of time it will it will return false because capital Y is not present in the string small Y is present right and what is knotting not in me uh if I write something like this let's understand this with example capital Y not in Str not in Str capital Y yeah capital Y is not in Str that is true yes capital Y is not in this string so it will return true so noting will work in a reverse manner of this in it will return true if the specified value specified character or the substring or the variable is not present in that sequence otherwise it will return false if I write something like this print small y or suppose I am checking e small e not in Str this point of time Small E not in Str but it is present so that is why it will return fourths right so these are membership operator and this is an example of string let's take example of let's take one more example list right in list we are having although we haven't discussed a list but we'll discuss that thing also suppose I am taking a list L and here in bracket I am taking 1 10 minus 1 0 17 some list of integers and I'm checking print 10 in this list now 10 don't need to put single quote because these are simple integer 10 in list in this list 10 is present yes it will return true if I write here print 10 not in l but 10 is in L and we are we are checking 10 not in L but it is present so it will return false right something like this so these operators these identity operator and membership operator we will use in later you know sections so this video is just to get you an idea about these membership operators and how to use these operators right so now let's see practical of these how to use these membership operators so let's create a new file here membership underscore operator Dot py right so first take a string Str is equal to I am taking suppose Jenny and khatri right J is capital n k is capital A and I'm let me just do this now I can I hope you can see this now print and I'm checking small J in Str right let's run this it will return false because capital J is present not small J if I write here capital j e n Str it's a we are checking a substring yeah it's present so it will turn true right if I write something like this j e n n y and foreign but it will return Folds see because Jenny khatri is having a space but here I'm checking with no space right if I write something like this now it will return to you right and if I write something like this like capital j and I'm writing not in Str so obviously it will return false because capital J is present in Str right so not in Str it will return if I print something like this if I if I check b b not in Str yes B is not in Str so it will return true it will return true right same for list if I check a list is L when L when I am taking 2 suppose 67 0 minus 7 45 something like this right and if I check print 2 in L one no need to put single code because these are not string so 2 in L1 L1 yes it's true right and if I check 20 in L one it will return false right second one false right let's just comment this out and if I check here 20 not in L one yeah it's true right and if I check minus 7 not in L1 but it will run false because it is present in L1 so I hope you got now the basic idea about membership operators right so I hope you got what are membership operators in Python so in the next video we'll discuss control structures in Python so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
