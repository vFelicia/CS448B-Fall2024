so in the stage of learning c programming from this video and we'll start a new concept and see that is structured in c so whenever a new concept comes the first question would be in your mind what why we need this concept why we need structure so that's exactly we'll discuss with this video like what is structure and why we need structure right and how to declare a structure then with example and some very important points about structure about declaration of structures that you cannot miss out but before that just want to tell you one thing if you are preparing for gate or will be preparing for gate examination then an academy is going to start a new batch rohan for gate 2023 from 17th of november so in this course the top educators will be covering all the subjects of cs and id and this course will include representative strategy tips and tricks practice questions and numericals along with the detailed explanation of all the concepts and the course would be covered in both hindi and english and notes should be given to you in english only and all your doubts will be cleared in those doubt clearing sessions in the course and this one is paid subscription but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on your paid subscription and one more thing an academy is also going to conduct a scholarship test for gate and esu on 14th of november here you can compete with thousands of learners from all over india and you stand a chance to win up to 100 scholarship you will get 20 questions and all the questions would be very challenging and original eight questions that has been curated by their best gate and esc educators and the time limit would be 60 minutes so you can assess your gate preparation in just 60 minutes you can see how you rank against all the others from all over india using live leaderboard that would be updated after every question just have to enroll for it the enrollment link i'll put in the description box of this video just go to that link scroll down and pick up the right test for you and just click enroll and use my code jkl10 to unlock the test and one more thing an academy special price week is going on so if you go for a subscription plan for 12 months or above you will get 10 percent discount and if you will use micro jkl then you will get extra 10 percent off on the reduced price so you can see the price detail on my screen so all the relevant links and the details i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out so now let's discuss what is structure and see and why we need structure see first of all why we need variable if you want to store a value in computer memory then we need a variable like i want to store an integer value that is 5 so how you will store we will declare a variable like in type int a is equal to 5 this is variable name this data type and this is how we can store value right if you want to store suppose 60 values like uh roll numbers of 60 students so we use aries i hope you are clear with this why we use rs that we have already discussed you can watch out that previous video right so how you will declare an array end suppose name i am taking a only and the size is 60 so here we can store roll number or any integer value 60 integer value like 1 to 60 or you can say roll numbers of 60 students if i say int roll number so roll number of 60 students we can store under a single variable name that is roll number that's why we need arrays like arrays are homogeneous no collection of homogeneous data item means we can store more than one data item of same data type right but see in real life obviously we have to process data of different different data types like what suppose i want to store information of a student so information is of a student means roll number of a student you can say name is also there marks then maybe address and many other things are there but here i am taking only three things so here c roll number would be of type integer name would be of type i know you can say string right and marks would be of type may be float so we are having three data types different different types of information we have about a student like int then string then float or maybe addresses there then also you know you can say float or maybe string many information is there about a student right and there are 60 students suppose at first we take suppose only two students so what you can do one thing is what for student one let's take for student one and this data is for student two for student one i can take different different variables like in roll number care name and here you can give size like 20 and here you can take float marks but for student two also you will you are supposed to take three different different variable for roll number like in this is for student one roll number s1 name s1 marks s1 this would be student for student 2 roll number s2 care name s2 20 float and this is for swing to max s2 so for storing this this information for two students we have taken three and three six variables and suppose we have 60 students so you can imagine how many variables you are supposed to take and here in information we have only three things only three things suppose you are making a software obviously for student information maybe for university you are supposed to make a software to store the information of student also faculty also and everything so how many variables you will take obviously it is not possible to take variables to store the data right so now we will take maybe you can take arrays but array in array yeah we can store polymers of 60 students like more than one student the data of more than one student but that data should be of same type homogeneous like suppose this is an array in row number and 60 so in this array we can store only 16 teaser value right i am taking float marks 60 here you can store marks of 60 student but that would be your float type only so here also you need to take different different type different different arrays right one array for roll number one for name and one for marks three arrays that is also not convenient to use right so is it possible to declare or to take different different data types all these variables under a single name right yes it is possible that is using structures right so structure see int is what data type array is what also a data type but it's not primitive primitive primitive data types are what or you can say fundamental layer types are in care flow double right then user defined data types are there then derived types are there so array is derived data structure is also a data type but structure is what user defined data type means we can define our own data type right using how you can define your own data type using these primitive data types in care flow double using these data types we can define our own data type so structure is what a user defined data type first thing is clear to you user is so the structure is user defined data type right now we will complete the definition one by one see now if i want to store these let me just rub this first so here we have this information about student different different data types are there all the variables this is having in data type this is string and this is what float so can we store the different different data types under a single name under a single data type yes that is structure so how you will write that thing means how you declare a structure see you will write struct as a keyword you will write struct then you will write the name of the structure means suppose i am taking student here here i am taking name of the structure is student then this curly braces whatever variable you will take just write down those things and then closing the curly braces and then put semicolon this is declaration of structure that's it this is how we will declare a structure struck keyword this is what structure name right or you can say the tag structure tag right and these these are what rollumber marks and name these are what members of structure this we call as members of structure right and what point you have to take care about declaration of structure that are very important at last you are supposed to put semicolon right so now you can using this you can store a student information like for 60 students or how many students you want to so you can store that also will discuss one by one how you will store you have to you know ah define the objects of the structure right array of objects you can also define everything you know we will discuss one by one in later videos this is just introduction so i hope it is clear to you what is structure and why we need structure i think this is clear why we need structure to process data of different different data types obviously we need structure in real life obviously in real world if you want to make a software or anything you have to process data that is of different different data types so you cannot declare so many variables in your program that would be very lengthy you cannot take even arrays arrays is not a good solution to process this kind of data like student data or you can say employees information or you can say those data structure will discuss trees linked list if you want to process those data structure then also we will need structure right so structure is what it's a user defined data type that groups elements of or you can say variables of different different data types under a single name what is the name student that is structure or you can say structure is a collection of one or more variables of different different data types that are grouped together under a single name i think if this is clear to you what is structure means this is clear to you why we need structure so definitely you can write down your own definition in your own words right so now what are some important point about structure see first thing the semicolon you have to put a semicolon here right second thing is what and see these are members of this structure so two members cannot have same name suppose i am taking here ah one more thing that is float roll number so here also number here here also no number this would be duplicate so the name cannot be same within the same same structure two variables cannot have same name this you need to take care right next thing is what here we cannot initialize this individual structure member like if you want to write down here like interval number is equal to 1 this would not be allowed and why so see when you write this thing when you write only this thing it doesn't mean the memory has been allocated in that computer memory no memory has not been allocated this is just a template you can say this will show the compiler how the structure is there how the structure is laid out right but memory has not been allocated to these variables to roll number to name and to float no to this marks no this is very important point see this is just a data type struct student like suppose if i write int this is what data type if i write float in main suppose if i write int memory has been allocated to this no it's just a data type if you write int a yeah now memory has been allocated to this a how many bytes four bytes or in some compiler two bytes right so this struct student is just a data type it's similar like struct student it's similar writing similar to writing int right so memory has not been elevated to this if you want that memory has been allocated if you want to allocate some memory so you have to write like this is data type this complete struct student is data type now you write down the name of the variable like here i am writing a so here you can write any name like s like s1 s1 for student comma s2 for student 2 this you can write so now memory has been allocated to this to this s1 and how much memory how much memory for this just calculate for this this and this intro number how many bytes four care this how many bytes 20 one byte for care float this how many byte four you can just do the total of this and this much byte has been allocated to this to this s1 to this s1 that will discuss in detail right how to define the structure or you can say how to take how to know this is one is called object of this structure how to declare how to define these objects how memory would be allocated right for 60 students if you want to sort the data then area of objects you are supposed to define you are supposed to take so that once we will discuss one by one in later videos i hope till now it is clear why we need structure and what is the structure the definition of the structure and how to declare the structure and some important point about the declaration of the structure all right so that's it for this video now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
