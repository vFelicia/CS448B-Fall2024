so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing operations on sets in the previous video we have seen Union and intersection and update operation Union and Union update in the section and intersection update how to modify a set with the help of Union and intersection also right now in this video we're talking about difference and symmetry difference like difference and difference updates symmetric difference and symmetric difference update right so let's see this we'll be taking the same example those set that we have taken in the previous video right okay now this is our file we are having here this set one set two and set three now let's see first of all difference so we have we can do this with both we have a method and we have operator also so with the help of method we'll see we'll do what set one dot difference method difference and in bracket we are suppose passing another set so you same you can call this method on one set and you can pass another set into argument as an argument so let's just print what it will give C so the difference I have told you in the previous video what difference will give set one dot different set to it will give like it's like set 1 minus set two so it will give the item in set one but which are not in set 2. item in set one but not in set two so let's run this then you'll get it better see I told you it will give set of items which are in set one but not in set two Ram is it in set to no so Ram is there sham is also not in set two so sham is their Jenny but Jenny is set to also so it will not give Jenny only give Raman Shah right and with the help of operator also we can do something like this set one minus set 2 that's it and you can print this thing right so let's just comment this out and do this thing so same it will give Raman shyam right but same here both the operand should be set and set but here it is not compulsory set one door difference if you do not pass here set two rather than that you can pass any iterable of values like I am passing this time at Apple and in Tuple I am having values like Mohan and same Shiva okay let's just comment this out so let's run this it will give Ram sham and Jenny because it will give the values in set one but not here Ram is not here it will give this value sham is not here in this set Jenny is not here in this because this is actually a tuple but it will convert this into first set Jenny is also not in this set so it will give Jenny right so for these methods it's what comes with that both the operands should be set like this like in this this and on multiple set also we can do this thing right so if I pass a set one dot difference and I am passing rather than this set 2 comma set three fine let's run this and just update this set then you will get it better in this set I am adding down so what do you think what output you should get before checking the output just pause the video and think what output you will get for this thing now let's run this and we're getting sham only first because it will be performed from left to right so set one door different set two in that case it will give RAM and Sham now on that it will perform with third set so don't different set three so RAM and Sham but Ram is in set three so Ram would also be discarded we are left with Sham only so it will give sham only I hope you got this same set 1 minus set to minus set 3 like this we can do now if you want to update the set with the difference update then we have a method difference update to modify your set like we are having you want to modify set one then you just write down that name of that sets at one dot d i double F difference update see you got this method difference update and here I am passing suppose set 2. Now set 1 has been updated so set one if you want to print it will give only RAM and Sham what it will do it will return it will update set one and it will return all the elements which are in set one but not in set two so in set one we have Ramen sham but Jenny it's a in set two so it will not take Jenny right so now set one has been updated if you want to update set two okay you can write down here set two so now this time set 2 has been updated if I print set two see now what output you will get set one is same Jenny RAM and Sham all the three values but set two has been updated Now set two is an empty set because in set two what it will give it will be having all the value set of all the values which are in set two but okay not in set one because set to minus set to difference obviously that would be a null so let's run this again see this time we are getting G and Akash for set two and Akash because Jenny is in set one so it will need not take change okay this is how you can update any set so rather than the setup you can pass any value is also in the form of less dot double with that only it can perform difference update right so this is what difference and difference update now let's see symmetric difference and symmetric difference update okay symmetric difference is what it will return the set of all values which are in either like set 1 and set two set one or set two but not in both in other terms we can write down if you are going to find out symmetric difference of set 1 and set two so set one Union set to minus set 1 in the section set 2 so that is symmetric difference maybe if you are not getting this lecture so you must read about these operations theoretically right in the previous video we have I have discussed this thing with the help of one example so set one dot symmetric difference and I'm calling this one set two okay let's print this what it will give symmetric difference of set 1 and set two C Ram Akash jira and Sham so it will return like set of all the elements either in set one or set two but not in both but Jenny is in both so it will not take Jenny I have told you it is set of all the elements it will return set of all the elements which are either in set one or set to but not in both Jenny is in both the set so it will not take then it will not return Jenny it will return only Ram sham ji and Akash right okay so this is what symmetric difference right so as we have seen like Union you can do Union of set one and set two and minus intersection of set 1 and set two intersection is genuinely so you can minus Jenny from Union of Z1 Z2 so this is symmetric difference now if you want to perform this thing on multiple sets then that is not allowed here set one and set three the symmetric difference please note the sound is not allowed on multiple set if I run this you will get an error systematic difference takes exactly one argument and you have passed two arguments at one and set two so this is not allowed now with the help of operator also we can do this thing so let's comment this out and what is the operator of this set one so this the operator which is on 6 numeric six set two this is what same thing you will get this is symmetric difference of these two set let me just run this and I'll show you what output will get Akash okay but this operator you can apply on multiple set this operator can be applied on multiple set but this method we cannot apply so let's run this again and it will give pradeep Jia so on the three set we have applied this thing okay now if you want to update the set so there is also a if you want to update set 2 Now set to Dot symmetric difference update we have a method here right and here we can pass like set one so what it will do we'll just now we have updated what set to so we'll print set two set one is as it is because symmetric different separate we have called this function on set two so set two has been updated now so it will update set to which is having Elements which are found in both set 1 either in set 1 and set two but not in both right so let's run this now set 2 is Akash ramji and RAM sham janakash with the Jenny is in both so it will not take Jenny either in set one or set to the element but not in both right so this is how you can update the set any set with the help of these methods also right you can update set one also so you can call this method say on set one and here rather than set if you want to pause a pass any other thing like a tuple I want to pass only two names and I'll print set one and set to booth Mohan and Shiva at Apple I am passing so now see set 2 is right setu is and set one is because we have updated set one so set one is now Ram sham Shiva Mohan and Jenny it will update set one having retaining only those items which are either in this set one or here whatever you pass here but not in both so Mohan and Shiva these are not in set one so it will add both Mohan and Shiva here right so this is how you can update any set so that's it about the French and symmetric difference if you are not getting these operations please read out these operations first theoretically understand what is Union what is intersection what is the difference what is semantic difference right using vane diagram and all then get back to this practical type of thing right better to write down first of all set all the sets and with the help of pen and paper with dry run you can say a kind of thing dry run first of all the code see what we are getting why you are getting that output and then run that thing on computer and Telly you are getting the same output or not then you will get it better right so in the next video we will see some more you know about sets like this joint sets and superset proper setup to find out these things so that would be next part of this video right so now it's in the next video then bye take care
