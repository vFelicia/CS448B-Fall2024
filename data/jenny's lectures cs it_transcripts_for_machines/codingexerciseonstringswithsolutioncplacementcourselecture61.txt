hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language in the previous video we have seen some member functions on strings right so theory part on strings is clear like we have discussed C style strings and C++ strings member functions on strings and all now we'll do one coding exercise based on strings you have done those member function and all so I hope you can do this easily right it's simple one now uh what we have have is we you have a name full name like Janti katri right but there is no space between this first name and last name so you have to reformat it to you know read it more easily what should be the output jti space katri okay now what you have to do see you have to you know remember some points first thing what you have to do is you have to declare and initialize a variable like first name you can take or any variable you can take from this variable from this given string variable full name right how to initialize this thing we have discussed in previous videos so you have to you know revise those videos those things first right next thing what you have to do now in the next part you have to take another VAR another string variable last name and you have to initialize this last name using substring method so in the first name you will fetch jti from full name in the sub uh second in the last name using uh substring you will fetch only katri right then you will con concatenate this F name and L name using plus operator but obviously this would be same as this if you will concatenate both J and and katri like first name and last name you have to insert a space between Janti and katri use using insert member function you have to use insert this function to insert a space between Janti and katri right see there are many ways to do this thing it's very simple but you have to perform these task to achieve the formatted full name right so pause the video and try this out so let's create a new file I hope you have done this so first we'll take a string variable uh full name right and here we have any name you can take right let's take we have Jenny's lectures so this is not obviously it's not not readable there should be a space between first and last name like Journey space lectures right so you have to reformat it okay first point what we need to do you have to take a variable first name this variable sorry and we will initialize this from the variable full name full name right but in first name what you want only gen KN right so what is the method you just write down the string variable name from where you want to initialize this that is full name and here start index from where you want to initialize the first character from where you want to take from which position from which index so from zero and next would be the length how many characters you want to fetch so length would be till s this s so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so zero and length should be 7 right so if you want to check out then you can just print this F name and you can check whether in in this name you have Jenny's or not see let's run this and see Jenny's right okay it's it is working fine now comment out this thing now second variable uh name we will take that is L name or last name and we will use here substring here we will fetch from this string we will fetch lectures only right so that we can do with subring so name of the that string variable full name dot we will call sorry not full it's full name full name dot sust Str and here you need to first two argument first would be same the start index and next would be length so start index from L I want to extract the string so lectures so the position of L is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 start index index is seven index start from Seven sorry from zero so L is on Seventh index and now next length so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 eight characters are there in lecture so I eight character I want to fetch so this sub subring I want to fetch from full name from this string so if you want to check out you can check out here rather then F name we can print last name so it will print kri sorry lectures lectures right now concatenate F name and this so let's take another variable uh formatted full name right we have a string variable formatted full name so now formed full name equal to F name plus L name just concatenate but no no it will not give you the desired result because if you now print the for this formatted full name let's run this and see what output you are getting it's Jenny's lectures without space so what's the use of doing these things because as it is this unformatted name we are getting so insert a space first so how to insert we have an insert function you have to use that thing right we can concatenate also like plus and here we can do something like this space then plus L name this will work fine let me run this and show you see with space you got it but no no no you don't have to do this thing you have to use insert function right so in formatted full name this name formatted full name I want to insert let's call insert function at which position you want to insert only one like a space I want to insert so first you need to give the position position where from which index from uh at which position so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 right seventh position so it will insert just before this whatever character at the seventh position here just before that character it will insert whatever you will insert so at seven right now the character in this string is L so just before this L it will insert whatever you want to insert and I want to insert only a space so just give a space here and that's it right we can insert a complete subing substring also or a single character like we are inserting only space here this insert we can use in many ways multiple ways I hope you have done this right so please try out these functions now let's print this formatted full name and see Jenny's space lectures right sorry so I guess this was simple one but if you didn't get it take your time and then again watch this video try to understand what we are using try to understand first what is this sustr what is the insert how to use these things what does this initialization means right we are initializing this variable from another string okay so I hope you got this exercise uh in the next we'll see what are functions in C++ so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
