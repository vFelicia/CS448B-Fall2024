so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language in the previous video we have discussed basic structure of a c plus plus program right now why we write programs like simple programs you will write it starting at two numbers and these kind of things ultimately we learn programming to build some software you can say right and what software generally do they manage the information the information can be in any form like the data in integer data it can be in text form it can be images videos sounds you know the numbers names anything but ultimately software is used to manage that information right now to store that information in the program what you will use sometimes different different you know types of variables and constants we use these kind of things we use many things we use we will discuss these things one by one in detail so in this video we'll talk about constants and variables in c plus plus that we we you know generally use while we write programs so what are constants and what are variables with the help of example with the help of program practical also will see on my laptop right so first is as the name suggests what is constant these are you can say fixed values right or you can see the values that cannot be changed during the execution of a program once you have defined a constant you cannot change that constant you cannot change the value of that constant during the execution of the program you cannot modify that thing these are fixed values right and constant can be integer constant real constant or you can say floating constant floating point character constant and strings right these you can say numeric constant these are character constant so integer constant simple numbers like 1 1 1 1 0 these are integer constant right 1 2 3 these kind of thing 34 54 right but it is not an integer con these are valid but if you write something like this dollar 1 2 3 this is not valid special symbol is not allowed if you write like something like this 1 1 comma 1 1 2 this number this is also not a constant valid integer constant if you write like something 1 2 space 1 2 3 this is not a valid constant right and real or floating point constant are what they have that decimal point like if i write 11.11 so this is integer part this is what fractional part and this is decimal if you write something like one one point zero this also comes under floating point constant right you can also write minus 0.1 this is also valid or if you write point 3 4 this is also valid right so these are floating point constant now character constant simple anything you write a single character you write in single quote that is named as character constant like if i write this thing a in single quote that is character constant if i write 3 in single quote that is also character constant see this 3 is different from this 3 this is integer constant decimal 1 decimal constant right integer constant and this is character constant so character constant we store generally we stored in the computer memory by the in which form sky call american standard code for information interchange right so in sky value of this small a is 97 right and this 3 is sky value of 0 is 1 is 49 2 is 50 and 3 is 51 so sky value of this 3 is 51 and this 3 is single integer simple integer constant so this this and this are different thing right but this is not a character constant if you write something like a b no here you have two characters it this under single quote there can be only single character or a symbol like symbol dollar this is also character constant we have space this is also character constant we have comma this is also character constant in single code we have hash in single code this is also considered as character constant right and these things abc capital a b c the special symbols numbers they all have their no corresponding sky value so in sky value they are stored right so this is character constant now string string as we know it's like sequence of characters so in double quotes we write like a b c or in double quotes if in double quote you will write a this is a single character but you write in double quotes so this would be string constant string literally it is not character constant this is different from this this is character this is considered as string by default compiler will add a null you know that null character this just to show the termination of the string so the string would be stored in memory like a and null and this would be stored simply by a no null character because this is a single character character constant right so i guess these constant are clear to you see these are same as we have discussed in c language so if you want a detailed video in this detailed explanation you can go to that video the link of that video i'll put in this ipad you can check out that i think the basics like what is constant that is clear to you now how to declare constant and why we declare constant let's see that thing and see this is also a string one two three four double quotes this would also be considered as a string it's not like that only characters sequence of characteristic character can be like any alphabet also special symbol like this would also be a string right so i hope now string is clear to you now let's see how to declare constants two methods are there you can use a const keyword something like this in a program i can write const keyword data type primitive data although we'll discuss data type in this series later but i hope they type simple data is clear to you that we have discussed in uh you know c programming language int the name of the variable a and just the value 10. this is the correct definition you can say of constant how you can write a constant or you can define a constant right if you write something like this const int a and then a is equal to 10 that is not valid this would be valid right now this a is having constant value now you cannot change this value in your program suppose i'll print c out a so this line will print 10 and after that i want to change the value a is equal to 15 and again i will print c out a so this line will give error because this is what readonly value you cannot modify it and you are you want to modify the only value so that would be an error because this is a constant a right so and see this a is what now how to store this value in memory like this whenever your program will run in your program we have some instructions we have some variables like we have data and instruction like add two numbers so data would be the numbers like 5 and 4 and the instruction would be add two numbers like we are supposed to add two numbers you write down the logic that thing so for that when your program will run some memory would be located in ram main memory right so some memory would be for your instruction the data some memory would be for your instructions and some memory would be for your data so how you will store this data like five and four in memory obviously you have to store in zeros and one one forms it would be stored not directly five and four it is just for your understanding purpose so we have to name this memory location because how you will store or how you will access that memory location if you don't have any name suppose i don't have any name then how you will call me right hey hi hey girl that is not a correct way name like jenny that is fine yes i have some space i occupy some space on this planet earth and i have a name right so same the data is there that is occupying some space in memory and that data is having some name under some memory named memory location the data is there so this suppose memory location name is a this is b so this a and b are just variables variables so variable is not like where we store data no we store data in memory but variable is the name of the memory location where we store the data so it's just a named memory location that's it it's a container for the data that's it name of the memory location right so these are variables and variables as the name suggests simple variables uh these well the value of the variable can be modified during the execution of a program the value of the constant cannot be modified right so i hope variable is clear to you right so now let's see the difference this value you cannot modify but if you don't write here const now in a this is now simple variable a is name of the variable integer type and this is the value now print you can print you can print the value using c out object and after that you can change it is equal to 15 and this line will print now 15. now this program will work fine i'll show you this on my laptop also because this is not constant this is variable right now yeah i think variable is clear to you uh just a named memory location of the name of the memory location where we store the data our data right so data can be integer floating type of data character or string type of data any data can be there right according to that we take the name of the variable there are some rules to define name of the variables right suppose that should be meaningful like if you want to calculate sum of two numbers so the variable you can take like sum in sum you will print if you want to calculate average so just take the name of the variable avg or average that should be meaningful it's not like that i'm taking x here i'll store some of two numbers yeah you can take this it's not compulsory to take sum in sum is equal to a plus b i'll store the sum it's not compulsory you can take x also x is equal to a plus b that is also fine but sum is more meaningful to you so it would increase the readability of your program right and see name of the variable always contains the letters a to z or a to z or the that android underscore and numbers zero to nine no special characters are allowed right like uh and the name of the variable always we started from a letter like s u m sum or underscore this is also fine but 1 s um this is not allowed but sum sum 1 this is allowed always started from either a letter capital or small or underscore that's it dollar sum this is not allowed any special symbol in this is not allowed like or you can say avg dollar this is not allowed or you can say abe average underscore or sum this is allowed underscore is allowed i hope these rules are clear to you now now second method let's see the second method to define constant second method is use this line hash define macro before obviously see you can write down this line anywhere in your program generally we write just uh after the header files right this is the correct you can say location to use hash defined type of things otherwise you can use it in anywhere in the program that is it's not a rule it's not compulsory that you have to define you know after header file only has to find just name of the constant i am taking suppose by 3.14 that's it or hash define any name of the variable like n 50 or hash define max 100 right so this pi like why we define constant see constant is what the value cannot be changed in the program so generally if you want that this value should be fixed like pi value should be fixed 3.1415 right because yeah it is fixed so if you define it as a constant no one can change it in your program see accidentally if someone by mistake change want to change the value of any constant want to change the value of pi that will give error right if you don't define it as a constant simple variable if you take it then anyone can change that thing maybe not intentionally but accidentally by default and that would give you error in the program or maybe not error but you will not get correct output right and if your program is large and you will not you are not getting correct output and you are not getting any error even so it would be very difficult for you to find out these kind of things like where what is the thing what where we have uh you know going wrong so better if you want that this value should be fixed in your program better to define that value as a constant either by using hash defined method or by using const method so now this value cannot be changed in the program this n value is also fixed m max value is also fixed now see here i am taking capital letters this as you can say naming convention when you define a constant using hash define using this line then all capital letters we take generally because when we define variables in our program we generally take small letters so just to avoid the confusion like this is a simple variable in a program or this is a macro type of thing to differentiate these kind of things we take like these things the macro constant in capital letters but it is not a rule you can simply write small mix that is also fine right but it just for your convenience to differentiate these kind of things we take these uh as a in capital letters so now whenever you program you write the max or n or pi that would be replaced by these values before the compilation start by the preprocessor right i hope the working of the preprocesses preprocessor is clear to you because we have already uploaded a video in this thing you can find out that video in c programming playlist right so i think the difference between constant and variable is clear to you let me just show you with the help of a program so let's create a new program here i'm just taking the variable const and where dot cpp extension would be dot cpp right so first thing you have to include iostream header right then we simply write in domain and just taking a constant c o and s t const int a is equal to 89 and i'm just printing a semicolon right sorry let's take e and d l so i have told you name spaces these are under name spaces these objects here out the stream objects e and dl these are under a name space the header file is a header is i o stream under this header there is a name space within those namespaces these are declare these things are there defined so you have to use std this namespace name std colon column scope resolution operator right now this is fine or after header file also you can write down something like this using namespace std rather than writing stdstd here but it is not a good practice to write this thing because in std namespace we have many things that we don't want to use right so better to use with the you know the things the objects the classes or the functions where from where these are from a study name space you want to use that should be you know you can say prefixed with std name space that also you can write or maybe it is like cumbersome for you guys so you can write down this thing using namespace sd that is also fine right or the next thing is you can use something like this using std c out using std endl and generally we also use like this using s t d c and also generally we use in a program so three you can define something like this now you don't need no need to write down this std again and again now anytime you can write c out in your program and you need to write down study colon colon cl because you have used this using so now you can use this thing throughout your program okay now this is constant let me just first run this and see what output you are getting whether it's printing the value of a or not see it is 89 right now i want to modify this a is equal to 78 and again i want to print c out a endl now see already there is a red mark under the say and you can the expression must be a modifiable l value because it is a constant so you can modify it error is there assignment of readonly variable a the variable is read only right if you take simple variable in a89 and this thing now that is fine now first time it is printing 89 next time it is printing 78 right so that is how you can define constants right so now let me just write down here const here you can write down float any character constant you can take string constant you can take if you take string see if i take string constant here so how you will write const if i write like string name of the variable is str i'm taking equal to i'm assigning jenny khatri right semicolon see now string identifier string is undefined so string here is as a class you know in c plus plus so that is in a header known as string and in that header we also have multiple predefined functions which you can perform with string so to use this string you have to include str ing string this header right and this still this string is what undefined because see header is fine but under which name space this string is under std so either you can write down here std colon colon now there will be no error right and c out just name of this variable string right or you can use here also using std colon colon string that is also fine right now let me just run this and show you what output you will get here okay see it is printing jenny now if you want to change this str equal to high it will give error you cannot change it see you cannot change let me just show you what you will get let me just run this and show you see it you will get an error right so you cannot change it now it will work fine and it will print simply what is the string janika three see it is printing janikatri here right so i think this is clear to you guys now see in string we have what just press ctrl and click to this string it is components for manipulating sequence of characters so you can see this is standard c plus library header include string this is the header so that's why we include this hash include uh string right right and they have defined these these system headers here we have right in these system headers you can click on any header and there you will get many things defined in namespace std like just basic string if i click then you will find here see see this is the namespace std right so this namespace std is in many headers iostream also in string also in all other headers also this is named and standards all the standard things are within this namespace std right so that's why we have to include std so now you can try out the different method of defining constant like hash define you can take a constant name n or max and the value and you try to change that value in your program and see what output you are getting that is for your assignment right you have to try out this thing at your home
