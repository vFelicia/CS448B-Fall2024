so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing some some special functions in file handling in c like in the previous videos we have discussed fck and fdl function now we are left with one function that is rewind function so everything about this function like what is rewind function why we use this how to use this in a program these things we'll discuss in this video with the help of a program i'll show you practical also right a program i'll show you in the last fine now before they just won't tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate 2023 or will be preparing for gay 2023 exam then an academy is going to start new batch from 2nd of february in this course their top educators will be covering all the subjects of csnit which will help you to prepare for your gate exam so here you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts apart from these classes you will also get doubt clearing sessions would also be conducted there so you can get all your doubt cleared in those doubt caring sessions and this would be this course would be in english only and note should be given to you in english and that would be a paid subscription because here you you know you will get a complete and structured course but here you will have a great offer that is unlocked 20 rather than 10 percent off if you will use my code jkl10 you will get 20 off on all the you know an academy's plus and iconic subscriptions and this offer is valid till 2nd of february so last few hours left to avail the software and they're also going to start few batches for all the branches like mechanical civil chemical for all the branches they're going to start batches for gate aspirants so all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's see what is rewind function and how you are going to use this function see rewind means basically like no as the name suggests remind something means suppose in a file we have suppose i have abc.txt and i have jenny's this i have suppose in file jenny's lectures is great channel for cs and id right now suppose at some point of time my file pointer is my file pointer is suppose in the last or maybe here but i want to read the complete thing the file pointer is here but i want to set this file pointer in the beginning so you can use rewind function just have to use rewind and one argument that is file pointer that's it it is not going to return anything return type is void right you just have to pass one argument fp and wherever the cursor is wherever the file pointer is after this line after finding this divide rewind function that file pointer would be shifted to the beginning of the this file right now suppose let's take one example i have now suppose i'm opening this file in you know write and read more both i'm going to write something also i'm going to read something also right so i'm opening this file suppose in w plus mode right in any mode you can open like r plus w plus or a plus both for reading these are both for reading and writing right in any mode you can write suppose you you are opening suppose in r plus mode right because in w plus mode whatever written in the file that would be erased right but in w plus mode but in r plus mode this would be as it is and you can read this and you can write something also right now suppose i think you can check this thing if f p is equal to is equal to null then just print error or cannot open file and exit from this point only but if this is not the case if you are opening this in our plus mode the cursor would be here and if you are going to read this thing then this just know put a while loop here and you can read this complete thing till end of the file right this is i'm going to suppose this is in a single line right but suppose i have moved the cursor here and how you can move that cursor here using fseq function we have a function f seek just fp just provide offset suppose offset i am providing 6 and what you are writing here seek underscore set from starting i am going to move that cursor six offset so here we have one two three four five and six this so now cursor would be here zero one two three four five six seven eight this is the kind of offset so at starting at zero plus six offset you are going to add means sixth index now cursor will be at sixth index that is at s right now we have moved the cursor here fine now suppose i i print like i am printing uh y f e f fp till then i am going to print f gets a single character i am getting and printf percentage c and ch and after that suppose f close right so now at this time after fc function the cursor would be here now if you are putting this while loop this is what reading loop till end of file it is going to read so what it will print from here it is going to print like s space lectures as good channel for cs and i t not jenny right and the supposed trophy single as you know sign fine but suppose now after this after this i want to print from here only from jenny from starting so what you can do how to move this cursor to here to starting after this while loop before this f close simply you will write rewind fb that's it now cursor is at this place and now if you write again this while loop this reading while loop no this is what i think you are clear with this loop you have used this thing many time while you are reading the content of the file till feof means end of the file character by character i am going to read using fktc and what character i am reading that i am going to print here so now after this everyone if you again if you write down this logic then what would be the output complete thing jenny's lecture says good channel for cs and id right so main motto of this rewind function is what to move the file pointer or the cursor from any position in the file to the beginning if cursor is here here here here anywhere the cursor after using this function the cursor would be moved to the beginning of the file that's it and you can use this in wplus also in a plus also but if you will open this file in w plus whatever the content in this file that would be erased obviously so first of all you will put something you will write something here right because you cannot read this content this would be raised so first of all write something here and then you can read and you can move the cursor using fc for anything right and then suppose you are not using here f seek i am not using this line i am just reading this content i am just reading r plus mode so what it will print jenny's lecture says grade channel 4 cs and i think right and now cursor is here again if you suppose want to print you can use remind fp and again you can write down this logic again this will be printed jenny's lectures is a good channel for cs and i think right so i think main motto of rewind function is clear to you now you can use this function with different different mode like r plus w plus or a plus and you can see how you know what output you are getting fine now let me show you practical of this thing so let's see this is a program rewind dot c now here we have created this file pointer and we have opened abc.txt and abc.txt right now i have jenny is awesome faculty right suppose this i have and i am opening this file in r plus mode right so that the previous content would be as it is so i'm just checking if is null then error otherwise i am printing first of all i am printing while this then i am just going to print whatever is there in that file right now let me just run this and show you what output you are getting see what output we are getting jenny is awesome frequently whatever is there that we are getting right now at this point of time the cursor is at end of the file right if you suppose again want to read then just put a rewind function after this rewind fp right and simply you can write down again this logic reading logic right and let me just run this again so it will print two times jenny's awesome faculty that is also faculty right otherwise suppose f seek function if you are using suppose here i am using f seek function f c i'm moving that function and offset offset i'm providing what six right comma from starting so position i'm going to set seek underscore set from the beginning and after that i am printing right and again i'm using rewind and again i'm printing so now you will get the difference here let me just run this again and show you the output see first time it is printing only is awesome faculty because we have set the offset six so now cursor has been moved six byte further so one two three four five six till space we have six then at i now the cursor is right after using f6 so it's awesome faculty again now i am i want to read complete thing so what you can do just rewind use the rewind function the cursor will be set to the beginning and again if you will write down the logic of reading the file like a while loop then it will print complete thing jenny's or some fatality right so wherever the cursor is if you want to move the question at the beginning at any point of time in the program just use rewind function that's it you're sorted right so i think you got the basic idea of using rewind function and now you can use this function with any mode w plus r plus a plus w plus mod if you if you will use then definitely it will erase the previous content so first of all you are going to put something to write something in that file and then you can read you can move the cursor using fc can rewind and everything right that thing i you can do yourself right that is you know assignment for you guys so that's it for this video and i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
