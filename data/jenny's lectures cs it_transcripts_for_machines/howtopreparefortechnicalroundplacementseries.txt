so in the series of placement preparation videos the next video is about technical round preparation right means we'll discuss now how to prepare for technical round basically for CSE and IT students and as well as those who are not from CS and IT branch and want to apply for these companies like CS and IT companies and want to go in this field then also this video is going to help you guys right so how to prepare for technical round C first of all we'll discuss a systematic way of the preparation for the sound right then I'm going to share some tips according to my experience that was where that are very important for this round right and those tips definitely is going to help you to stand out from the crowd you'll be highlighted in that case right so definitely you will get some advantage so now first is what C as we know the DAC concepts are very important in this case right almost in every company's interview these cons will focus on BSA concepts first of all right so for these one first of all before going to the DSA concept what you should learn you should be expert in any one language programming language it may be C++ or job I'll suggest either C++ or Java right it's not like that many students think that you should be very good in five four or five languages or all the languages no you should be very good you should be you can say you know very sound if you are a fresher then obviously you should be very good if you have some experience then you should be expert in that language right so just choose it any more language there C++ or Java and go for it right learn the language practice the program's practice as much as you can right so develop your programming skill first of all so these points are basically from a fresher point of view those who are in P final year or final year students right after completing obviously when you are in final year then you have read many programming languages like C C++ Java also and maybe you have worked on pi as well right or some other language so you have the some knowledge of four or five languages right but you should be expert you should be very good in one language right that is very important because ultimately in coding round when the company will give you three or four questions in the coding round then obviously you are going to implement that in one language only either in C++ or Java right it's not like that they'll ask you to implementing both the languages or three or four languages right so keep this thing very clear pick one language and bring all the concept of that language right so that you can write down a program you can implement a logic you can think a logic and obtain a optimized way in that language right when it comes to the coding part after the language now you go for the DSA concepts first of all go for the basics then go for the advanced concepts right learn all the concepts plus practice those concepts at the same time only only theoretical knowledge is not going to help you right you have to implement those concepts also like link list there is that qs trees when and how to use which data structure to implement which problem which we should use it we should use here stack or we should use their cue like this or we should use here linked list or array is something like this you have knowledge of everything bless you should have knowledge of here the important point is time complexity and space complexity because when you are going to code right you are approach there matters a load your code should be optimized maybe one student has written a code completed the problem got the output but the code is not so much optimized right time complexity space complexity is very high and you have written a code almost 90% you haven't get the result expected output but your approach is very good you have taken care of the optimization of the code so maybe you will get selected and that student will not we get selected right so here your approach matters a lot so while implementing the concept you should take care of the optimization of the code as well you should have the knowledge of Big O notation theta notation time complexity and all right now after the essay concepts other computer science core subjects like DBMS or operating system computer neck networks these are also very helpful these are core computer science subjects you should have a good knowledge of these subjects right if you are not expert you know all the subject and at least try to be very good in one subject right so that if sometimes from a fresher they they don't expect much so sometimes they ask you in which subject you are comfortable so you can go for you can choose that subject and you can control your interview now the interview is in your hand right they'll ask you the question from at least from that subject at least more question they'll ask from that subject and you can answer those questions right now here the very important point is what see although some students can solve the problems basically obviously you have gone through those who are prepping for placement you have gone through the previous placement papers of the companies like TCS we provide all right so maybe you are able to solve the coding problems see they give you what they'll give you 120 minutes and they'll give you three to four problems and you are supposed to solve these problems within this time frame right so maybe some students can solve the problems but they don't focus on the time frame when you practice right so you should focus on the time frame also that you are able to solve these problems within this time frame or not or how many problems you can solve within twenty one twenty minutes right so that is also very important for this what you can do you can participate in various contests meaning online you know sites are there they used to conduct these type of contest errs and there you will have a good practice of solving the coding type of questions within the time right so I think one of the good platform is geeks or geeks many of you your students are aware about this so it is a very you know wellknown platform for preparing the computer science subjects they have started a new course that is placement hundred it is a hundred percent placement preparation course they have focused on the placement preparation here the complete placement preparation right means they have designed this course in a systematic way so if you are preparing for product based companies like Amazon Adobe Microsoft or any service based companies the big short companies like pcs with pro cognizant or any startups like swiggy or Lionel so this is going to help you definitely there you will get theory means the nodes as well as lecture videos of all the important concepts of these subjects and DSA concept as well as C++ and Java right plus they will have these contests plus a teaching assistant who would always be there to assist you if you have any query or if your if you got stuck anywhere right so now let me show you the details of this course so now here first of all they have covered the languages so you can choose either C++ or Java right so you can go for the tracks when you click on the tracks there you will get the video lectures right you can click on the video lectures they have covered all the important topics which are generally asked in the interview you can go for the video and you can watch the video right plus they have also covered 3d you can see their notes also after covering all the topics you can go for the problems there you can see if multiple problems are there you can click on any problem just read out the problem just read out the input format output format what should be the input what should be doubt the output expected output everything is given so complete read out the complete problem first of all then you can write down your own code right and you can check the expected outcomes if you stuck somewhere then you can check the hints also here in this problem only one hint is given because it is very simple problem there are some big problems also that which is about the DSA concepts there they have given three to four hints right so can go for those hints first and then second and third end like this and then if you still stuck then go for the solution please don't directly jump to the full solution first try it yourself go for the hints if you are not getting anything if you are stuck or frustrated then go for the full solution right and then now you can submit your problem compiled in yes and you can submit then they have covered data structure basics all about arrays link lists trees and everything is covered then they have covered data structure advanced advanced topics right here also you will get the video lectures of everything the titute in the theory of everything plus the problem of each topic now you when you go for the problems and you can click on any problem see here in this problem you will get the company tag also that this problem has been asked in these companies right so that is also very good for you they have covered the problems which are previous previously asked in though the wellknown companies the big giant companies right so that is also very important point here now after that they have covered objectoriented design because sometimes nowadays they usually ask from a freshair about low level design questions like how to design a parking load or an elevator something like this right so they have covered these things also now plus they have covered all the scores here subject like DBMS operating system and number two networks and interview questions regarding these plus empty part is also there you can watch the videos plus personality development courses also there like the soft skills right now after completing the course you can go for the contest there you will get many contests are there and they have properly designed it in a way the company will ask in this in the coding round like they have given time frame 120 minutes and you are supposed to complete three or four problems will be there coding problems the pattern would be same as which would be asked in the companies so that is going to be very helpful for you guys plus a very good point about this is what a discussion forum right here you can come if you got stuck somewhere you can come you can write down your query you can ask right I already they have asked many queries if your cure is same you can go for this query you check the replies right the replies are from the export teaching a sustained from leaks for weeks right so that is also very important here plus if you have purchased any holes from geeks Ferguson there's a thing that is weak so reason job portal get hired here you can see all the job openings and you can apply here plus after completing the course they conduct a fulllength mock test series also that is also very helpful for you right I will give you the link of this course in my description box you can check out there right and if you apply the code Jenny ten then you will get extra 10% discount on the Scopes now we are done with your language your desi concepts and other core subjects right but obviously all the computer science ruin most of the students will do these kind of things how we are going to stand apart from the crowd so always learn new things new skills maybe some students are you know interested in Android development so you can go for that thing right you should have something extra from the crowd so don't just stuck on these things always try to learn something new right so you so that you can showcase that skill in your resume way fine plus your projects are also helpful here try to make as many projects as you can in your maybe you're being suppose BTech so in that case or BC or something like this right it's not like that the project should be very big like suppose if you are working on a project library management system and you think that they are you to body asana project here so that is not going to help you right you will think like this but know if the project is very simple that is also fine at least try to make the project try to work on the project at least three to four projects should be there in your resume a maybe five or six projects sometimes some students has been worked on ten projects also right maybe the projects are very small but that is also going to help you because in that case the interviewer has something from your resume a to ask you write and if you have done your project yourself then you know each and everything about that project which technology which programming language you have used the front and the back end the database connectivity if there is any database connectivity the working of your project you know everything and if you know everything about your project it means you have controlled your interview now they can analyze that you can easily work on a complex plots project and big project as well right if you have done three to four or five projects small projects also that is also fine so projects are very helpful right plus internship try to get internship in a wellknown company right if sometimes I have seen some students also such students also they don't have any internship right or you can say any internship from a wellknown company or something like this they have just done any certification or like this but they have projects in their resume a three four five projects in that case also it would be helpful so please don't worry because sometimes maybe you have tried very hard but your luck is not so strong that you haven't get any internship so fine this thing is in your hand right you can work on projects so try to work on projects plus 1 more point is they're competitive only this is definitely going to help you very much right there are many website many platforms so you just go for competitive coding right because see sometimes one beast kind of websites they give you scores they give you stars right and based on your rating the companies can hire you they know that you are a very you are very good in you know competitive coding so that is also a plus point for you so you should go for this thimbles if you want to stand out from the crowd these points will help you both for oncampus placement and of campus placements right how these are going to help you specifically these kind of things in offcampus that I am going to tell you in a separate video right and don't think that this placement kind of thing is for finally a students and in last six months we are going to no prepare for placements and all right see if your first if you're in first year secondary or better in you are in third year if you focus on your study just try to learn always new skills don't waste your time work on projects and always try to you know grab these concepts sincerely not just to pass out that semester but sincerely you have to read the core subjects right always try to do something new always try to create new ideas new logic right so when it the placement time comes then you'll be less stressed out right your mental pressure would be very less because they're how already prepared you are very sincere throughout the year four years or maybe three years fine so next video I'll discuss basically how to crack off campus placements right so now I'll see in the next video till then bye take care
