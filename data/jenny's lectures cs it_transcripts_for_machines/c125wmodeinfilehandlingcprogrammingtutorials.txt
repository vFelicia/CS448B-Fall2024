so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing file opening modes in c in the previous video we have discussed r plus mode basically we have discussed r mode read write append and r plus r plus is for both reading and writing we will discuss in this video w plus mode this is also for reading and writing so maybe you will say what is the difference between these two r plus and w plus both are for reading and writing purpose but there is huge difference between these two those differences also we will discuss with the help of practical with the help of program i'll show you program also on this mode w plus mode and it at last i'll give you an assignment also now that is very interesting you are supposed to tell me what would be the answer of that thing right all these things will discuss in this video but before they just want to tell you one thing for gate 2022 aspirants an academy has started all india mock test series in the month of january every sunday so you can

i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's see what is wps mode see it will open a file both for open a file both for reading and writing but see the special cases if file doesn't exist means it will create a new file and will open that file if file exists in that case what it will do then it will truncate the file length to 0 means it will erase the previous content and the cursor would be at the starting of that line suppose this is my file abc dot txt right and in this file i have jenny right now cursor is here only at the last fine suppose so now if file exists and you will open this file into w plus mode then this jenny would be raised means the content would be raised and the cursor would be at the starting only now the file length is zero right next thing is what this mode is you know especially for writing purpose our w plus mode right like r plus mode was for mainly for reading purpose but we can do writing also right so i hope new now you can you know write down the difference between r plus mode and w plus mode both for reading and writing but in r plus mode if file doesn't exist it will not create a new file right it will return null that's it in w class mode if file doesn't exist it will create a new file and open that file right next thing is what in our plus mode if file exist then it will open the file but previous content would not be erased it would be as it is right and now your next content new content you can add wherever you want to add like maybe in the starting or in the middle of the already existed content or at the last so mainly if you want to update the previous file then you will open that file in r plus mode but in w plus mode the previous content would be erased so you can write down new content from the starting one right so i hope now the difference is clear r plus more than w plus more now you can write down the differences three or four differences right now let's see a program of w plus mode now see we have a file abc dot txt suppose in this file i have journey so now i'm going to open this file into wps mode if fp is null means because of some condition because of some error f open is not able to open the file it will turn null so cannot open file right if successfully f open has opened the file in that case if this doesn't exist it will create a new file and it will open the file right now you can read the content see now my question is already existed content in this valid journey and w plus mode is for both reading and writing so can you read this jenny yes or no no why so because you are opening this in w plus mode so as soon as you will open this in w plus mode as soon as this file would be loaded in that ram this jenny would be erased so now you cannot read this content so now what content you will read whatever content you will write here now the new content that content you can read right that is not possible in w mode you cannot read the content you can only write how let me show you see now suppose i am writing here f put s and i am writing a string like khatri right and in fb this i want to write right a string i am providing or you can take the input from the user many you know possibilities are there you can try out your own different different things so this i want to put in this file so now what happened right now this journey would be erased and khatri would be here now at this point of time cursor is here only right at the last now you will say i want to read this content for reading let me just write down the loop i am writing down the loop why character by character i am reading this content and i am just printing what whatever character i am reading ch right and at last f close fp so before using ch obviously we are supposed to declare ch here now character by character i am reading i hope you know you know you are aware with this logic because we have discussed many times whenever you know we have written a program in the previous videos how to read a content from a file right so just write down a while loop f eof means it will return end of file just pass the file pointer right and logical not fine now is it you know possible now to read this content means this this program will give on the screen kathry or not it will not give why so because we have written this content khatri here and now the cursor is here only in the last means file pointer is here right now the condition is why f eof fp means it will return end of file so yeah fp is at end of file so now it will give what end of file means it will give true true means one and one not we are using negation logical note one not means zero zero zero means false means while zero zero means false so we will not enter into this while loop and f close so now we are not going to we are not able to read this content so what you should do now you are supposed to move this fp from the last to beginning here to read the content how you will move this there is a special function rewind rewind and just pass the file pointer now after this after writing after this line you will write down this function remind fp now whenever a compiler will see this function means now the file pointer has moved from here to from last to beginning now you can read this content and now you can write down this logic means not f eof it will let an end of 5 but the cursor is here only is it end of 5 no so it will return false false means 0. negation or not 0 means 1 so while 1 means true so we are going to enter here and f get c means a single character we will read means k would be red and k would be stored in ch and k would be printed now again cursor would be here only here here like this you can read at last it will get an endo file and that's it so you are supposed to you know write down a special function in your program while using w plus mode and while reading the content right i hope now you got this right if you have any query you can ask me in comment box now let me show you practical of this thing so let me create a new file we will name it as w plus mode dot c right and r plus mode the content i am going to copy this content only because it is almost same right whatever the difference i'll see you see we are going to open the file first of all in w plus mode right so here we will write w plus if f is null okay it will print error and or you can say cannot open file that thing you can do now rather than rather than reading or suppose you want to read this obviously this is of no use because you cannot read the content right because content has been erased you are opening in this w plus mode so this is not we are not you know writing this reading logic or if you want if you want to write you can write this logic and you can run this program and you can see what output you are getting now there is nothing in this abc dot txt if you will open this in wps mode and now i want to add what f put is jenny only jenny i want to add right and f close so see abc.txt file is this one and here i have suppose i have this is awesome this content i have in this file right now let me just run this program and see what output you are getting okay now see the successfully this has been run because there is nothing on the output screen because we are not printing anything just let me just show you this abc dot txt file now in this file we have jenny previous content was this is awesome that has been erased and the new content is jenny so now suppose if you want to read this content so this this logic this one the reading logic you will write after this thing after f put so whatever function you will do like f put c or f printf or whatever thing you will use the logic of writing something to the that file after that you will write the logic of reading right so now this is what let me just remove these comments now see it is not going to print anything on the screen i have told you because now cursor was the file pointer was at the last of the file so it will not uh you know you are supposed to move that cursor to at the starting so using rewind we can move that cursor to starting or let me just comment out this thing first and now let me just run this whether you are getting jenny the output or not whether you are this program is printing this jenny or not on the screen let me just run this see it will not print anything it is just running it is not printing anything on the screen so now let me just close this and let me just write down just add this line this function rewind fb right and rather than you know using this f get is now i want to read this character by character let's say this logic also so just pass in a get c function you are supposed to pass the file pointer and one character it will return so that character we are going to store in which variable ch and in printf just we are printing percentage c and ch right so before using the ch uh yeah obviously we are supposed to declare this variable ch right now character by character we are going to read and now let me just run this and show you the output on the output screen you are getting jenny i hope you can see this and in the file also we have now jenny right so this is how you can read using this special function rewind why we use this function i think that is clear to you now one assignment for you is see suppose in r plus mode this is my program this was the previous video we have discussed so r plus mode in r plus mode i am opening this file right and first i am writing this logic reading logic i am reading whatever the content in that file and after reading i am writing this f put as jenny not this one only one line i am putting i am writing f put as jen so it will write also in that file it will read also first and then it will write so now where this jenny would be written in this file suppose any in abc dot txt in abc dot txt i have jenny khatri is awesome faculty okay i am writing this danica is awesome faculty this is my content in abc.txt and this program is there so now you are supposed to tell me what would be the output where this jenny would be added right i hope this r plus is clear to you but before you know running this program on your computer screen and just you know copy pasting that output yeah this would be the output no you have to think you have to drive in this code and then you have to tell me right and then you can uh you know check you can tell your answer you can run this code and you can tell your answer right now i hope uh you know that's it for this video now so i hope this w plus mode is clear to you guys now in the next video we will see a plus mode right so now i will see you in the next video till then bye take care
