so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing file opening modes in c we have discussed read mode right mode append mode r plus mode w plus mode now we are left with one more that is a plus mode we will see this mode in this video with the help of a program i will show you practical also and we will also see how the c plus mode is different from our plus and w plus right but before they just want to tell you one thing for those who are appearing for gate 2022 exam an academy has started all india mock test every sunday in the month of january so you can assess your preparation

file abc.txt and in this file i have only jenny this text i have right so here a plus means you are opening this file both for reading and appending see not reading and writing appending is different thing appending means writing at the end of the file writing means maybe you can write from the in the beginning of the file or anywhere in the you know you can move your file pointer and you can you know write down anywhere in that file but basically we will say it will open the file for reading and appending if you will read then the cursor would be here for reading purpose the cursor would be here at the starting and jenny would be printed on the screen if you are going to append something means the cursor would be here and from here you can append from the end of the file means appending means basically writing at the end of the file so if i want to append khatri so that would be appended here at the end of the file right i'll show you see it doesn't mean for reading it has one pointer that is at the beginning of the file for appending it has another pointer at the end of the file means it has basically two pointer no only one pointer is there right it depends if you are reading that pointer will be moved here if you are writing if you want to write you if you want to append something then the cursor would be moved here only the file pointer and the you know whatever you want to write that would be appended from the end of the file right only one pointer is there so now see i am writing one thing the program here obviously we are going to create a file pointer first and that is null right and i am going to open this file using the function f open and the name is abc.txt and in a plus mode so it will open this file first for both reading and appending and if file does not exist means if there is no such file in my pc then it will create a new file a plus mod will create a new file and the new file would be opened right in wplus also if file does not exist it will open a file but in r plus if file does not exist it will not open a file it will return null that's it right now you can check here if f p is equal to is equal to null then you can simply print here like file doesn't exist or maybe you can write no cannot open file or you can print any error and exit one if file has been opened successfully by the safe woman function then and suppose in my file i have only jenny so if you want to read first you can write down the logic of reading right and jenny would be printed if you want to write something append something you can simply write down suppose i am writing f put s a string i want to append like jenny and after that i want to append khatri so you can simply put that string here comma and file pointer fp right so this complete string and at last you can close the file f close fp so now this khatri would be appended here only right now after this if you want to read if you want to write down the logic then what is the logic simply you can write down a loop f eof function fp and suppose i am reading character by character ch is equal to f getc function is used to read a character and the file pointer you can pass here and whatever you read the character you can simply print that's it before using ch you are supposed to declare this right but it is not going to read why so because after appending khatri here now the cursor is at the last and if you want to read the cursor should move from here to here at the beginning so you can use after this after this what you will use which function rewind that we have discussed in previous video right rewind and fp that's it now cursor would move moved from the last to the beginning and after that you can read after this now janik would be printed right so what is the difference between you can say w plus r plus w plus and a plus if you compare it will open for reading and writing but a file doesn't exist it will not create a new file right it will open a file both for reading and writing but one thing the previous content if file exists then previous content would be erased right means the new content whatever you write that would be overwritten means the previous content would be overwritten right if this is a file if you are opening this in w plus this dani khati would be erased and whatever you will write that would be written from here only in r plus the previous content would be as it is right in a plus also if and if file doesn't exist it will create a new file in a plus also it will create it will open for reading and appending means the previous content would be as it is and whatever you will write that would be appended at the last and if file doesn't exist it will create a new file so i hope now you can write down the difference between r plus w plus and a plus right now let me show you practically and see one more thing if you will not write this f put s here these two lines and directly i am writing this reading logic right so what it will print if suppose in my file i have jenny so it will print jenny right and after this reading logic if you write f put as khatri fp then khatri would be appended here but khatri would not be printed because khatri would not be red because you have you know written this this logic reading logic here and after after this logic you are writing something so that would be appended here but on the screen only jenny would be printed i hope you are getting my point now let me show you practical then you will get it better see i have this file a plus one i have created this file a plus mode dot c and here i am opening this abc suppose abc dot txt file in a plus mode right i'm just checking the condition if not going to open then just print no file otherwise first of all i am reading see i have just written the reading logic while this character by character i'm going to read and after that i'm going to write down in that file f protest this is awesome right i'm going to append see so now in abc dot txt file we have jennifer's awesome faculty right this content i already have so let me just run this and show you the output see it will print on the screen jenny khatri is awesome faculty right see jenny khatri is awesome faculty right and now just check the file abc dot txt now in this file we have the content jenny kathryn faculty as well as this is awesome at the end of the file because you are appending this file footage this is awesome right this is what appending means writing at the end of the file right and if you will write this line and suppose this file doesn't exist i'm writing here a dot txt i don't have this file in my pci dot txt so now let me just save it and run it and show you the output see what it is printing on the screen nothing because this file is not there in my pc it will create this file right and it will open the file it will create a new file so there is nothing in that file so we are writing first of all the reading logic so what it will read nothing and after that it will write in the file this is awesome so in the file if i check see this is the file a dot txt in the file i am having this is awesome right if file doesn't exist it will create a new file now suppose i am writing here but abc dot txt file and this this f put s this logic i am writing before this reading logic first of all i am going to append this is awesome in this file and after that i will read right and i am not writing that rewind function so now let me just show you what output you will get see it is not going to read anything it is just running because cursor is at the end of the file right so better to now first of all kill this terminal and now let me just try down that rewind function rewind fp now let me just run this again and show you the output see now it will print jenny khatri is awesome fake lt this is awesome this is awesome two time a dot tx sorry abc dot txt because here we have first of all it was jenny khatri is awesome faculty this is awesome this is awesome two time right because last time also when we run this abc txt this is awesome was added right but while you are fetching the content at that time it was not printing anything it was just running because the cursor was at the end we haven't moved that fp pointer to the beginning of this uh file yeah but content was appended this is awesome that's why it is showing two time this is awesome this is awesome i hope you go to my point right so now i hope the same plus mode is clear to you so i hope this a plus mode is clear to you now we have discussed all the modes all the six modes read write append r plus w plus a plus one now we are left with some special function like you can say rewind fc function so these kind of function will discuss in the next video so i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
