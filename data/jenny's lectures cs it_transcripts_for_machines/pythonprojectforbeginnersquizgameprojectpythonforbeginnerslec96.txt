hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen file handling in Python so I guess we are done with the basics of python right now I will be discussing the some Advanced Topic in Python right some libraries and some Advanced topics right but before that in this video we will be discussing one project so before starting some Advanced topics we'll be discussing two or three or maybe five projects simple projects for beginners because now we have we have done project with the help of functions we have you know learned Hoops concept and all so with the mix of these concept we'll be working on three or four or five projects and then we will see some Advanced Topic in Python right so now in this video we will see a quiz game project right so let me just show you whenever you run this what kind of output you should uh you know okay so this is the output whenever you run your project then please show like welcome to my quiz game and the question first question see the ability of one class to acquire method and attribute from another class is called and then it will show you the option multiple choice question ABCD and then you have to it will ask enter your answer and let me suppose I'll just enter Because I know the answer is a inheritance so its correct answer so it will show correct answer your current score is one out of one and then it will show next question so which of the following is a type of inheritance so next question same suppose a but this time it is incorrect answer and the correct answer is D and your current score is 1 out of two right then question number third like this so again incorrect answer and like this it will show till the you can say end of the answer obviously I have entered s so that is definitely incorrect so incorrect answer correct answer is C and I have only five question here so now I have given correct answer your current score is two out of five you have given two correct answer and at last it will show your score is 40 percent right so this is how it should look like you are you know your that game quiz game so I have only five question right now in my game so you can have as many question as you want okay so now I think with the help of first we will see this project with the help of procedural approach function functions with elbow functions right and after that we'll see this with the heck of a second approach that is using objectoriented programming that we'll see in next video right okay I think now you can pause the video I can you try this out like this is not so much tough because if you have followed my python playlist then this type of project we have seen two or three this type of project right so that is that that was like maybe guess the number game higher lower game and that is similar like this game and if you are not following this playlist then definitely you're missing something great so pause the video and try this out okay so this time let's create a new project so I'm creating a new project and the project name I'm giving like uh quiz game right and see The Interpreter is this okay fine and let's just click on create where you want to create in this window or a new window or you have to you want to attach this project into because we have one project python project so I want to attach here only okay now see we have a quiz game project this one right now in quiz game project right click on the send let's create a new file and that let's say I'm just giving the name to this file main.py and here I'm going to write my code so first thing just the decoration type of thing so let's just print first welcome to my quiz game so first obviously you need question and answer if I want to give quiz to you then I'll prepare the quiz means I have a question bank or I have many questions as well as I know the answer of those questions so I'll give you that quiz whenever you submit the answer then I'll check whatever the answer I have the answer sheet and your answer sheet I'll check if you have given the correct answer or not right so you should have a database of questions and answers definitely so so let's have a you can say a question Bank or question data okay and in this this I am having a list and in this list I am having dictionary and in this dictionary what I'll have key and value pair so key is what I'm having like text and here the question like this is the question the ability of one class to acquire methods and attribute from another class is called this is my question right as well as the next key value pair in this dictionary I am having is answer so answer of this multiple choice questions are there so either it's a b c d so suppose answer is a like this I hope you heard this see this is one dictionary and this is having one question with answer of that question like this you can have multiple dictionaries each dictionary is having one question and answer of that question like this I am having here five question with their answers so this is my question Bank I'm having I'm having only five question with there answer right answer of each question okay now one thing obviously now you should have like how many options are there like for this question I'll be having four options a b c d but here I'm just having the question and answer of that question that is so where are those options four options so for that suppose I am taking a list named options so there can be see multiple ways to solve this problem or to create this project this is only one way the simplest one one I'm I guess I'm going to discuss here so you it's not like that you can solve this problem or you can make this project with the help of you know with this method only there are multiple ways so in option there is a list and I am having a sub list so in this list for first question for first question I am having all the options like a inheritance because answer of this question I have given it's a option so in a the correct answer that is inheritance right and then like this for B suppose abstraction and for C like this you can have four four options okay so see this first list is having all the four option for first question like this comma and I am having second list second list is having options for second question like third list fourth list and fifth list like this okay so these are my list of this is for first question ABCD these options four are for second question third question these are for fourth question this this list is for fifth question right okay so now I have database question as well as answer plus options for those questions now the main thing you need to write down the logic so first obviously it will print first of all the question first question okay so we have to access from this list the text the value of this key from this dictionary so like this obviously for Loop we need to take four and any variable name I can take like four question in question Bank right and here what I need to print you need to print question so this is a list because question bank is a list so with the in list I can access the data with the help of the First Data is at zeroth index the second dictionary is at one Index this third dictionary is at second index like this then third index and fourth index so at zero index this dictionary but from zero index I don't want to access the complete zero index if you write something like this a print question Bank and then break it if suppose you think like just print in subscribe just give question so let's run this see it will give an error in line number 21 where you are writing this then list indices must be integer slices not a date because this question is a dictionary in question bank is a list so if you write something like this so now at first in question it will assign the first whatever there at the zeroth index so at zeroth index I have a dictionary so this dictionary is assigned in question so I cannot write down like in subscript I cannot give a dictionary it should be integer something like this so like 0 1 2 3 4. so okay we have a range function we can do something like this for question number in range and range should be till length of length of this question Bank length of this list length of this list would be one two three four five so here range and 5 if range 5 then it will generate range 0 1 2 3 4 like this and that's exactly we want first of all at zeroth index I want to access what is at zeroth index then second then third and fourth and like this so now print question bank and now question number at first in question number I have zero so it would be zero question Bank zero but that is not also correct because it will give you at zeroth index I have a complete dictionary with the answer it will give then at second in the first Index this dictionary third like this but I want to access only the question means the value of this key text Key right so again you need to give here that what we say because now I have question Bank and question number this is what see this is what now this complete dictionary now from this dictionary I want to access the value of this key text key so just provide the key here as it is and key is right now let's run this C now we are getting questions only questions okay but questions as well as after question I want to show the options a b c d after every question okay now you have to do that thing and let's see before printing this question again I want to separate out some decorator something like this so you have to access from this list the first list then the second list then third and fourth and fifth according to the question number if question is this first then first list will access all right sorry so one more for Loop for I in suppose options listening okay now what I will access first for first question C this question at first 0 will be assigned to question number so it will print first this one the ability of one class this first question so now I want to access this first list right according to the question number right so how you can access the list name and in bracket we will write down if you think like just write down I here so let's run this see this I it should be integer not a list because this I first is is a list so it is not correct so in for I in option here just provide the question number so at first question number is 0 so option 0 so at zeroth index we have this list right now from this list in I what would be assigned first of all this the first thing a inheritance right then B then C then d let's run this now okay still you're getting so rather than options I here we simply print obviously I right because for I in options question number question number is zero so zero options 0 means it is now having this list first list right so at first in I this first value would be assigned a inheritance so simply just print I next time B abstraction this item would be assigned to I so simply just print I and I is B abstraction then I is C polymorphism then I is the next item that is D object so simply print I that's it let's run this and see you got this okay all the questions and then there options fine but now next is now you have to ask uh answer from the user so he'll just take input enter your answer either a b c d so in capital I am assuming so if someone enter by default small ABCD so let's just use the upper function that will convert into upper here only okay now you have to check the answer okay so suppose I am having a check function sorry check answer function and there what you need to pass what the user has entered like the guess or next thing the correct answer now the correct answer is here in this list in this question Bank and with in the first dictionary I am having a key value pair answer a like answer D so from here you want you have to access the correct answer now how you can access and how you can pass this thing so the question Bank the name of the list is question bank and then according to the question for first question I need to access first the right answer for first question I need to pass first right so how to pass first the question number because at first question number is 0 here 0 right so question Bank zero would means this completed dictionary and then from this dictionary this key value pair again give the key name as it is answer it will fetch the correct answer and it will pass the correct answer so let's just Define the same functional name that is check answer and it will accept two argument so one parameter name I'm taking user guess and next I am taking correct answer okay let's just check out if user guess is equal to is equal to the correct answer then let's suppose return and will return false okay this is our check answer this you can see function so whatever it will return I am going to accept that thing in a obviously a variable so this taking a variable is correct so if is correct would be whether true or false either true or false okay now if is correct means if is correct if true if true would be returned true so if true means yes if true then we will obviously we will uh you know keep our score variable and that score would be plus equal to 1 would be increased by one so first of all you need to have a score variable that is 0 at first right before it we can simply print correct answer score would be increased right else we will print incorrect answer right okay let's see what's happening welcome to my quiz game okay the first answer suppose a that is correct answer then next question again a that is incorrect answer it is showing me incorrect answer right then again a that is also incorrect answer then in case I am having C that is correct answer I am giving B correct answer okay but it should give you like finally what is the score and if you uh if you give the incorrect answer then it should show you the the correct answer is this right okay now after this your final score is and from the score variable we will take this right but if this is incorrect answer then obviously it should show at that time the correct answer so from where you can fetch the correct answer obviously from this list question bank I am having here correct answer of each question right so the correct answer is this is how you can fetch this we have already done so the correct answer is like question bank then question num because question num this is the variable at first it is zero so zero means first dictionary would be fast and from the stat dictionary just fetch the answer if outside of this you are using in closing and closing closing and you know opening bracket double quotes then here you should use single quote right let's run this and see if right now I am C okay it is incorrect answer and it is showing me the correct answer is a again incorrect answer the correct answer is d now correct answer right and at last it should show me the score so your final score is one only as well as now it should show the percentage the score so how you can calculate that thing your score is from the score variable then divide by how many question you have in that question Bank how you can calculate with the help of length function to that question Bank just put this complete thing into bracket and then divide by sorry you're not divided by it's uh into 100 this will give you the percentage and then just write down here after that sorry percentage the symbol right and rather than your final score is this you can just write down here like U have given this much of correct correct answer right and if you want to show like after every answer you want to show the score like one out of one one out of two or two out of two like this so here also I can print something like this okay within this for Loop only see these two print statements are outside of for Loop but this should be within this for Loop After Effects so F and your current score is score and then slash one out of one two out of two like this if you have like 50 out of 100 so that's slash it's not divide it's slash slash and obviously whatever the question number but plus one because question number is starting from here because from 0 because in the range it will assign 0 first and one two three four but in reality question number should be one two three four five like this so just add in this variable Plus 1. right let's run this and see a correct answer your score is one out of one fine now again a incorrect answer the correct answer is D your score is one out of two because you have two question has been asked but you have given one correct answer again a again incorrect answer your score is one out of three let's give correct answer this time now it's two out of four again correct answer B so your score is now three out of five you have given three correct answers and your score is sixty percent so like this I hope now you can play around with this game and you can if you want to you know modify this or see only five question I have taken you can just make this a separate uh like you can say what you can say separate file in that file you can just take 1050 or how many question you want as many questions as you want you can take and options also in that file only and you can import that file into this main file rather than writing everything in this one file okay here I'm just showing you because I have just taken five questions so there are not so much you know tough to show this thing but if you have 50 question then obviously it is not a good idea to take all the question and options in one file and the code also in that file only okay that is not a good programming practice we can say just divide this and make another module or another file for this question bank and options right like this if delete that these from here and in this project quiz game Let's create a new file and just have database quiz underscore database Dot py and there just paste this thing so in our main file if you want to use these things we will import we will import what database right and now it will be better if you run this we can see here question bank is not defined here you are using question bank but that is not defined question bank is variable in this file in this file in this module so this is what a concept of modularity as well we have divided our program into two things one is database this module and one is our main program so I'm just importing this module in my program so this is what modularity so it is going to make things simple right so rather than this one more way to import is what like I can do something like this from quiz database import ant as well as from quiz database import options now it will not give any error see right it is it will work fine now and if you simply write import question bank then here wherever you write question bank then first you need to write down the module name first means modul name is quiz database here which database dot question Bank same here quiz database don't question Bank in case of options as well as here also the quiz database name of the module dot options right so here we are having two variable question bank and options so if you want to access these two variables in our main wherever you use these variable name you have to first of all write down the module name that is the name of that file quiz database then dot option or dot question but if you specifically import question bank and options like this using from keyword like from this import question Bank import option then we need to write down the module name and Dot so I hope you got this thing but you can make this thing a little little bit complex as well maybe after every question it will show you do you want to play again that also that functionality also you can add if yes then only show the next question or if press next this one then only show the next question right or you can add some option to exit from the game right so that kind of thing also you can add this kind of thing we have already you know discussed in our previous projects so if you have done those projects in my from my playlist then easily you can Implement that functionality in this also like do you want to play do you want to continue like this right so I hope you got this project now just try out this thing this is what procedural approach programming using function we have done the same right next we can do this same project with the help of objectoriented programming approach oops because that's also we have discussed now that thing we will see next video till then you can try out to make this project with the help of object oriented programming approach right so now it's in the next routine bye take care
