hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing functions in Python we have discussed like functions normal function the definition I mean the introduction of functions and functions with arguments then types of arguments then we have different discussed like arcs and quarks right based on that we'll be doing one simple exercise coding exercise right now you are you know going to uh paint a wall right and you have to calculate the number of cans needed the number of cans of paint needed to paint that complete wall right so what you need the input height and width of that wall right then you will calculate maybe the area as well as you need the coverage right means suppose let's assume one can of paint can uh paint seven square meter of area seven square meter of area of that wall one can and this is the coverage now you have to define a function that will accept three arguments like height weight of the whole height of the wall and the coverage and based on that you have to calculate how many cans would be needed the output should be how many cans needed to paint that complete wall right now what you have to do see now the formula is a number of cans needed is what area like height into width divided by this coverage coverage means seven square meter right so this this number of cans like the number of cans the complete name you can write this thing this formula you have to apply it area means height into width then divided by the coverage seven square meter but the problem here is what suppose uh here you will get 1.7 something like this right after decimal it will be having few numbers right but obviously we cannot buy 1.7 can like point seven one we can buy or point seven we cannot buy either we will buy one or two cans so now you have to round this number up means 1.7 means it should give you answer two if the answer is one point 4 then also obviously we will not buy one because point four you need so you will not if you buy one can you will not able to paint the complete wall so you can buy two because if there is some extra paint it's okay we'll uh keep that paint okay extra is fine so in this case also it should give answer two so you have to round up the number round up the number 1.4 also two not one 1.7 also a two if you use the round function then it will give two but it will give one so you cannot use round function so one hint is you can use ceiling function see you can just read out something about C what is this and how to use this is your you can say assignment so I'm not going to tell you how to use this function I'm just giving you a hint use seal function to get this kind of offer to round up a number right so just do some Googling and find it out so I hope you got what is the problem and how to find out the formula I have told you everything what should be the input what should be the output right so now pause the video and give it a try okay so I hope you have done this you have tried this out now let's create a new file and like paint area calculation dot py or simply painted Redwood p y right now what you need height and width of the wall suppose I'm taking a variable H and obviously input function using input we will ask height from the user so this would be string by default that is why here only I typecasting it I am converting this into integer see int right so same for width so let's just copy paste this and take a variable MW then end input enter the not height this time it should be width of wall in meters two thing we need and we know that like coverage is equal to 7 Square per meter so that is 7. so let us call the function suppose suppose we haven't defined the function yet so we are calling the function or let us Define the function first right okay we are defining the function here like Def and function name is paint suppose calculation paint calculation right and in bracket 3 argument it should accept height width and coverage right then only we can apply the formula so we are writing here like height comma width and cover over B you can say coverage both you can take same cover and here just calculate area area is equal to this height into width right now how to calculate number of gains number of cans have to calculate this area divided by this cover whatever this cover is or you can say coverage any variable you can take divide by cover all right and simply you can print here using a string like we are simply printing you will need how many cans uh we have that thing in this variable number of pens so just put that variable in braces these many number of friends or maybe you will need five and then we write cans of paint right something like this so just pass this function here sorry call the function here because to execute this function you have to call first so paint calculation and you have to pass now three arguments so better to pass keyworded argument maybe first you will pass height first you will pass width that would be assigned to height and a positional argument would be some Maybe that will not give you proper results so better to pass keyworded arguments right so suppose first time passing width like w i d t h C width equal to automatically it is showing width equal to w then height equal to is equal to H and then in this definition we have cover so same okay sorry here we will write down same cover cover equal to automated showing cover is equal to coverage this function coverage and let's call it right so these are keyworded so that is why this width would be assigned to this width only if you simply write down first W then H then coverage rather than keyword it then whatever the width that would be assigned to height according to positional arguments right so this is fine now right I hope that is not this is not so much stuff so let's run this and see what output you will get first it is asking in the height of meter uh wall suppose three and width may be suppose four so you will need 1.714 this cans of paint but obviously we cannot buy 1.7 we will buy two cans right so one thing is still remaining you have to round this function up around this number up number of gains so either in a separate line you can in number of cans you can just round up this number using seal function right seal is from maths module math module so whatever function you will use you have to import that module first so first import math import math right now you can use seal so directly here only how to use see from random module if you want to use any function like choice so you will first try you have written first the module name random dot the method name choice so same here first write down module name math Dot sales your automated showing C right and in Seal we simply write down this formula area divided by cover so in one line only you can round this number up rather than using another line right or in another line also you can round up this number maybe another variable name you can take like n is equal to math dot seal and in bracket you can just pass number of cans and here you can write you will need n cancel print so let's run this for same height is 3 and 4 width is 4 meter so you will need two cans of paint this time you're getting exact output right whatever you need so that's it this is how you can calculate the area of wall to paint right I think that's easy okay so I hope this was not so tough for you guys and you have done it and the next video we'll see one more coding exercise so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take
