so in this video we are going to discuss some tips and tricks about how to finish your exam you see net exam specially paper one within timeframe within 60 minutes means how to solve maximum questions within 60 minutes right because many equations many students have this complain that we have prepared very well for paper one also for paper two also but specially in paper one because of less time we were not able to solve many questions and because of that we were not able to clear the net exam because of this time management only right so I am going to share my experience also what I used to a follow when I generally go for exam any online exam because as we know that now UGC is conducting this exam online it is computerbased right before it was offline yeah when I I have given this exam that and at that time it is offline it was offline actually but I have gone through many online exams as well so I am going to share my experiences so what I use to follow at that time so that you can get maximum you can solve maximum questions in within that time frame it's not like that your questions are C for paper 150 questions are there right and 60 minutes and for paper you have 100 questions and write 120 minutes means total 150 questions are there and you will get 180 minutes three hours before within paper one and paper there was some gap gap of I think 30 minutes but now it's single duration you will get 33 yards and you have to solve 150 questions it is not compulsory that you have to submit paper one within 60 minutes right and after that you will solve paper there is I think no such boundary but still still you have to just devote only 60 minutes to paper one it's not like that if there is no boundary no boundary of submission then you will devote one hour on 10 minutes and 15 minutes so just paper one and after that you solve the no just keep this thing in your mind just you have 60 minutes for 50 questions not even 61 minutes right and 120 minutes you have to devote for paper and each question is of two marks so total marks 300 marks would be there right so first thing you need to take care as of what please before going to the final exam please practice the online mock test because paper 1 is what general paper so these tricks whatever I am going to tell you will be applied to every student right so many of you are you know maybe from those who are from computer background or many other students also familiar with computers they can deal you know they can answer the questions they can read the question on the screen and they can answer the question they're familiar will be in in dealing with computers they have practiced generally the students who are having computer background they have practiced many more tests maybe not from UGC net some other test also any aptitude test or any other test on computer so they are familiar with the process if you are not familiar with the process how to solve the questions on computer how to read the questions how the questions would be displayed what options you will have at that time so I would suggest to all the students whether you have some computer background or any other background please practice that Moke test that on the website of UGC net would be given online mock test so that you will get familiar with how the question would be displayed what four options would be there like 7 next for review save and review just mark and next and well the next would be displayed how to go to the how to switch to the next question how to submit where the submit button is there how to submit the exam right and if you have answered the questions then there would be on that question like this is the first question so there would be green shade on that questions suppose second question you haven't answered and you just click on next that would be red means you haven't answered these questions if you have suppose just click the button save and review means you have answered the question but you are not you are not sure about that you want to review that question in at last so that would be some different color would be there or if you have just suppose you have on the fourth question you have just clicked the button mark for review so that would be some different color in different color and there would be the meaning of each and every color so four categories would be there so these four categories of I think questions would be there you have answered the questions mean that would be green you haven't answered the question that would be red you have answered means save the question but mark for review that would be also a button so that would be in different color this is mark for review that would be in different color so at last you have the idea that how many questions you have answered and how many are still untouched you have just skipped like this so that you can review and the last so this thing is very important please get you familiar with this thing with the demo with the mock test right how actually the paper would be there in front of you have you how to answer the questions the meaning of different colors and everything where the timer would be there where your name would be there so that at that time when you will go for the exam you will be you know less nervous at that time because you in its if you will see everything the first time then it would be you know you you will need some time to figure out that the meaning of everything and if you just the questions you have answered means you have just click Save and next means you have answered the questions those would be counted at the last if you have saved the question and mark for review you have done if that's this thing your answers would not be counted at the last right that√≠s why you have to review your answers in the last so at least reserve your five to seven men it's to review the paper right at last means for paper one five to seven minutes right and fourfoot paper to ten to fifteen minutes just to review your answers right because see it is impossible to answer all the 50 questions correctly within 60 minutes some questions would be definitely be unanswered some questions would be there in which you are in dilemma and you have saved the answer but you have just marked those questions for review so within these five to seven minutes and last you have to attempt all the questions because third very important point is what there is no negative marking so please attempt all the questions if you think that almost you have completed 30 to 35 questions and you are sure that at least 30 questions are correct means you will get 60 about 60 marks right in paper 1 so that is fine that is considered as a very good score so now you are left with suppose 15 questions that are unanswered or maybe some questions are for review so it lasts within 5 to 7 or 10 minutes just mark all the questions answered by just guessing the answers you no need to you know for unanswered questions because you know you don't know the answer of these questions so no need to read the question just mark either a B C D or whatever status you apply like je method or anything but you have to answer all the questions in the last that is why I'm saying you I am telling you that reservior at least 5 to 7 minutes in lust so that you can answer the unanswered questions also now next step is know how to answer the questions right see some sections are very timeconsuming like I think specially bi the reading comprehension and reasoning right these are some timeconsuming sections and theoretical units are like teaching aperture research aptitude communication ICT higher education Indian politics and government policies these are what these are theoretical questions so so my suggestion would be what please do not try to solve these questions first so try to attempt those section first which are less timeconsuming and which are easy for you in which you are strong like when you read that question then within five to seven seconds or within 10 seconds you will come to know that can you answer the questions or not right some questions would be like that just by reading once within 5 to 7 seconds and you will get the answer just mark and save and next right if you think that you cannot solve that questions just leave it do no to waste much time on a single question because on an average for each question you have just one minute in paper one right please do not take it on your ego that I have practiced this section very much right so I have to solve those questions sometimes in the questions would be tricky and you will not get the answer just you will waste your time please do not waste your time on a single question that is what I am saying you write so in one go from 1 to 50 solve these questions right like you think that within 5 to 7 seconds some questions would be there within 5 to 7 seconds you'll get the answer just save and next by reading the answer by reading the question one time you think that yeah you can devote 10 to 15 seconds more or within 20 or within 30 seconds you will get the answer so try to solve that questions and now at the same time within that first go only when you are going from 1 to 50 like you think that di questions reading comprehension question reasoning questions you are good at these things but they will take some time more than 30 seconds right means within one minute or maybe 1 minute 10 seconds within 10 seconds you can solve these questions so you can mark those questions hard mark for review right that would be I think in purple or blue color so that in the last when you have answered from one two fifty some questions would be answered green some question will be an answer that is you don't know the answer that are red some questions may be like you know the answer but you just want to review so just press save and mark for review and some answers some questions would be like di in reasoning that they'll need some time you know the answer you can solve the question but they'll need some time so you can mark for review those questions so I think within 20 to 25 minutes you can do this thing right now it's time to solve these type of questions see from di you will get five questions but at least two questions would be very easy you can solve those questions very easily right so try to solve those questions first like Mark for review questions you can click on that like for question is marked for review and that question would be in front of your screen write at least two questions from di would be very easy solve those questions at least two questions would be from reading comprehension that would be very easy try to show those questions from reasoning also logical reasoning max reasoning ten question would be there so maybe at least five questions would be there that you can solve easily maybe within one minute so try to solve those questions yeah those two or three questions that are tough you can leave right now those questions it's not like that for comprehension first of all read the passage right then read the questions so obviously at that time you know we are not we are nervous and the timer is ticking in your mind in front of you so it's not like that you have read the CIM that passage and you have remembered everything and now you can answer the question so it's better do note I think do not waste your time by reading the passage first first read the question write at least two question would be very easy the answer of those questions you will get within two three or four lines first two three four lines over the passage read the question first two questions and try to find the answers then read the passage after reading the questions that is my personal experience in my personality and you will get the answer very easily right same for reasoning now next comes to save and mark for review try to review those questions again right but now you are not supposed to leave any question like save and Matsu review for later because you don't have time so just save and next right means you have answered that questions now only questions would be remaining I think within 20 minutes you can do this thing now last I guess 15 minutes are left and your answers are now questions are now I red flag means you have the questions remaining questions are unanswered so now one by one obviously you have 15 minutes one by one read the question if you have 15 minutes if you really don't know the answer don't waste the time just mark any answer and if in this case like reasoning or comprehension or di if you still think that those are remaining two to three questions that are tough you have left those questions those you can solve within one minute or two minute so try to solve those questions right and if you don't know the answer just take any answer for that but you haven't you are not supposed to lift any question now at this time in last 15 minutes unanswered or save for review you have to attempt every question now within 60 minutes now every question is having your green color means you have answered every question so I think the main point here is what at first please try to solve those questions in which you are sure and you think that you can get the answer within 30 to 35 seconds maybe these questions are from reasoning also reasoning from reasonable so there are some very simple questions and you can get the answer within 30 seconds so you can solve those questions it's not like that it's reasoning you have to solve after you know after 20 or 25 seconds if I have said that just leave these portions first and after that soul maybe comprehension also just read the first or second in one go only just read first and second question and if you think that you can get the answer within 30 seconds by reading just two or three lines first you can answer those questions also within one go during the first from 1 to 50 right but please do not waste your time much time at starting on those questions in which you are not sure and those who will take more than one minute to solve next important tip is what see if state you are reading the questions from first then second question then third and fourth fifth sixth and suppose first six to seven question or eight questions you are you are not able to solve means you don't know the answer and you have left unanswered so at that time many students you know get stressed and many students get nervous like I haven't attempted first six to seven questions or eight questions now well what what will I do please don't do this thing there are many questions left at starting obviously your mind you have to set your mind at that time everything is new you have you have to solve your progression within 60 minutes and obviously you are little bit nervous so you will get 1 2 minutes or 3 minutes to be familiar with that situation so that is totally fine it's ok if you haven't answered the first 6 7 questions for 8 questions in starting it's ok it happens you have to just remain at that time cool and you have to just focus your full concentration would be on reading the question just read that question with full concentration and with fully focused on that question right it's not like that to get that question you have to read that question two or three times or four times please do not do this thing right read that question in such a way that in first read only you get that you can answer the question or you cannot answer the question and trust me it's very easy to get 60 plus marks in paper one if you have prepared if you have just devoted sincerely at least 15 days for preparing of paper 1 and if you have managed your time in attempting the paper 1 during your finally I think with the preparation how to attempt the question during your final day during your exam that is also very important so that's it for this video now I'm going to see in the next video till then bye bye take care
