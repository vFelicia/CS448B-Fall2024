hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in this video we are going to discuss about one of the best and free way to start your programming journey by learning Python language yes now you can start a programming journey and take your preparation from basic to advanced level by enrolling in guided path of python by code Studio and you can Master the topics like input and output operators conditional statements Loops list string collection and many more topics now what is this guided path and why you should enroll in this guided path okay what benefits you will get see the guided path covers from basic to advanced level topics in a structured way with detailed notes Plus after notes you will get some practice questions for all the topics covered so notes plus practice questions mcqs on all the topics right and all the important topics would be covered in this guided path like from introduction to basic topics introduction topics like features of python macros comments to how to write down how to implement a code how to write down your first program in Python two Advanced topics like input and output control statements if it's Loops data types like list strings uh Collections and many more topics an average time required to complete this carried path in 25 days plus not only this after completing 80 percent of this path you will get a free certificate right now how you can enroll in this guided path why you know how you should go to this guided path right means how to proceed once you go for this guided path how to login what modules you know how many modules are there what content you will get here everything now I'm going to show you see all the relevant links and details I'll put in the description box of this video you can check out you can click on that link and you will be redirected to that page now see so now see how you can follow this guided path okay uh the link I'll put in the description box of this video when when you know once you will click on that link you will be redirected to this page now first of all you have to login there is a login button you have to enter you can start your code Studio with Google or Facebook account or you can log in you you can enter your email address then this continue button would be highlighted and then you will get an OTP right you just enter your that OTP and you can successfully you will be logged in right so first of all you have to login next thing you just go to the guided path uh you know tab like this here you will get the step explore guided path categories in this on this website so there are many guided path here you will get guided path for for python basics of python you can just click on start learning right after start click on start learning you will get a copy something like this now let me show you the modules here in this path you will get total 11 modules right so in the first module first of all introduction introduction introduction to python nodes plus practice question notes plus mcqs so once you click on the first one introduction see you will get notes introduction to Python and all right see introduction to python how to get started with python how to download python python comment this then mcqs then questions on all the topics covered till now on these you will get these mcqs right so you can select your answer and you can go for submit and next right like this in each module this kind of thing you will get first notes then the mcqs and practice problems and second module variables and data types like introduction to variables and data types variables in memory scope of variables type casting and then uh practice questions also so let me just click on this attempt first then variables introduction to variables the nodes then data types nodes right then questions valid variable names mcqs on this topic then we will do variable names second part then on data types also then Theory variables in memory theory part here variables in memory right you can click on this and you will find out this then scope of variables variable scope local scope Global scope and then mcqs on these topics covered like this for each module you will get this kind of pattern right so next module is basic input output in Python like what is the Sprint statement how to take input from user then practice problems see let me just click on these practice problems here you have to write down code C first is find area of rectangle you will click on this right and this is the problem statement take the input take the length and breadth as input and find the area so you can write down your program here you can just select the language obviously you are learning python so you will select Python and you can write down your code here then you can submit your code right like this you will get practice problems print name and a swap two numbers calculate simple interest these kind of things and after that in fourth module operators in Python all the type of operators 30 plus mcqs plus practice problems as well then conditional statements and Loops same conditional statements then Loops then break continue pass return statement then practice problems right mcqs Plus at last practice problems as well you have to write on programs then functions in Python types of function function overloading scope of variables everything then list in Python you will get like this in each module then string then object oriented oops Concept in Python Constructor then inheritance and then you can say polymorphism abstraction these things then exception had exception handling in Python right and then in the last module 11th module collection what is collection in Python right so this these are 11 module here you will get nodes plus some mcqs plus some practice problems right and one more thing after completing this if you have more doubt you can go to The Refuge section also right and after completing these after ah 80 percent of the completion you if you have completed 80 percent of this module then you can download this unlock this free certificate without penalty right this is the certificate right you can earn certificate of completion now what are prerequisites you have to know you have to be you know familiar with just basic aptitude right you can learn Python language it's very easy so if you are a beginner then you can go for this thing because here you will get they are going to start from introduction basic to Advanced topics Plus in a structured way you will get Plus at the same place you will get query nodes and mcqs plus practice problems right so all the relevant links and detail I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out and if you find this type of video helpful for you guys let me know in comment section so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye bye take care
