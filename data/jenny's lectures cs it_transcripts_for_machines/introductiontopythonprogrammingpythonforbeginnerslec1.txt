so this is the first lecture of our python code so you can say python course we will see in this video introduction to python right like you can say some features of this language application areas who are using this python why this is so popular nowadays some features this kind of thing we'll be discussing in this video about python or python i'll pronounce it as python right okay now see python is nowadays the most popular programming language but you can say it is the fastest growing programming language nowadays it's not like that it is new language because you you know you think that recently it is it has become so popular so it is a new language no the concept of python came into picture in 1989 and even java was you know the concept of java or came into picture in 1995 so it is before java right but recently in past few years like python has become so much popular and why so that also will discuss right now basically in every area python is being used right now the main areas are machine learning data science artificial intelligence see nowadays the data is a big problem many companies like you can say your facebook youtube any shopping websites they are having data of billions of users right and how they manage that data and one more thing is what see i think you have noticed if you suppose uh nowadays i you know a search for especially chicken carry kurtas right so i have i've been looking for these kurtas on two or three website shopping websites and whenever i open any other website you know for study that kind of thing so those relevant ads they show me now ads of those chicken curry kurtas and all so have they come to know the advertisers like how they come to know that i'm interested in buying those chicken curry kurtas so this is what they have analyzed my data how many websites i have visited in which how you know i'm interested so they have analyzed that data they have collected my data they have analyzed that data and according to that they have mind you can say some pattern they have formed and they come to they come to know that i am interested in chicken keri kurta so they show me the relevant ad i think you must have noticed this thing also right so this task is what this analysis of data and all in this also python is being used right so in many areas this is one application of this language and see in many areas like whether it's software development it's web development software testing machine learning artificial intelligence data science game development making of any apps mobile apps desktop app websites or web apps anything hacking even hacking in many areas right now python is being used and it's not like that small companies are using this language no the big giants companies are using this language maybe the main language or supportive type of language as a support language you can select like google uh youtube cura instagram these companies are using these big giants are using this language right and the person who are using it researchers scientists software developers software engineers software testers game developers mainly data analyst and even school going kids they are also learning or you can see using this language see because you know researchers and scientists they want us like they don't want to you know uh utilize or you can say wasted their time by learning a complicated language and python is easy language so they talk they went for this language python language so that is why recently this this field is a you know on boom machine learning artificial intelligence data science this kind of thing so that is why with that field python came into picture because they these kind of people researchers scientists so they are working in this field they want a simple language to work on right they don't want to waste their time on learning a complicated type of language python is very simple very easy to understand language so they took it for this language and that is why this uh language has become so much popular within the you know recent years so white has become so popular because first thing is it is easy to learn easy to understand and it has wide range of applications i have told you in how many areas almost in every area it's been used second thing you can write down you can solve any problem with fewer lines of code suppose you want to print hello world in c language so that those header files main function and printf hello one in c plus plus also header files std name space std main function and all in java those you can say the main function system uh sorry public static void mean then system dot outdoor printer and then hello world this kind of thing in python simply what you need to write print hello world that's it nothing else a simple line nothing else so in fewer lines of code you can solve complex problems right and more easily you can understand this course so it will you know save your time also another benefit and it is high level language you don't need to be aware about those memory management type of thing like in c you have to aware you have to you know keep track of you have to manage the memory manually but here automatic memory management is there it is high level language so you can do more with less right with the writing you can say less code you can do more in this it is objectoriented programming language but it's not like that it doesn't support that paradigm procedural and functional it supports multiple paradigms objectoriented procedural as well as functional right it is multiparadigm language it is general purpose language almost in every field for making everything you can use this language it's multipurpose language it is interpreted language these are some features of python you can just note down these features so it is also python is interpreted language without compiled language right and one more feature of this it is open source right so that is why it is having a huge community and rich library many ill you know inbuilt packages modules functions those you can use in your program without writing those functions from scratch because it is open source anyone can contribute in this right they can write down their packages or functions or modules and they can contribute it is open source anyone can use those inbuilt functions libraries and all right like in cnc plus also we have some libraries in there predefined functions are there these are already defined function like uh if for string concatenation we use directly a function str tap so the definition of that function is already in those libraries you don't have to write down the definition of that function you don't have to tell the compiler you just use that header file string dot h and you can call that function because it is already been defined in the library by some other people so by someone else so same it is also having rich library because it is open source so and huge community it is having if you are finding any difficulty in this so there are many forums discussion forums you can post your queries and definitely you will get answer for example some libraries are you can say numpy pandas tensorflow for machine learning and data science while in this field they use that library see basically libraries are what some codes are written codes so for some basic functions are written on those libraries so that programmers don't have to write down those function from scratch and they can reuse those functions in their own program right so that obviously it will save time of any programmer right because they are using they are reusing that function like for making chapatis you need atta right so just go to any shop maybe you can buy whole wheat or atta right but the process behind that thing generally farmers do that process that long process right they have done for you so they have built those things for you you just have to go and buy you can reuse that you don't have to do the whole process from scratch because it will take definitely long time and you don't know definitely most of you don't know how to do that farming process so same thing those inbuilt libraries packages modules functions are there programmers can reuse those functions and so it saves the time of programmers and many frameworks are also there like django flash if you are interested in web development right and i told you like automatic memory management is there in this language right and it is extensible language right you can extend you can support more features can be supported you know can be added like more libraries or functions can be added because it is open source anyone can contribute in this thing in this open source school right and there are lots of career opportunities also i'm sure this point is very important for you guys yeah there is lots of career opportunities for this in this field for this language because you know i told you this is one of the fastest growing language in terms of developers in terms of the companies using this language you know the big giants like youtube cura instagram google these companies are all sort of thing just using this language python so there are many career opportunities and average salary is also high like it's from 8 to 12 per nm so that is why it is so popular and i'm sure you are aware about now this language some features who are using it the application areas of python and all so please make down your own notes if you have any doubt you can let me know in comment section you can ask me right and we'll be using python 3.x the latest version of 3.x because python two point x that version is obsolete now it's no longer supported uh from january 2020. so they have declared that uh they'll not support this version now so will you work on python three point x version the latest version whatever is there so in the next video we will see history of this language first because you know before going to battle better know your enemy so we'll see history of this language properly like the inventor of this language how when why he developed this language why this is called as the name python so these thing will be discussing in next video right so i'll see you in the next video till then bye
