so in the series of learning Python programming language in the last video we have seen while loop till now we have discussed Loops in Python 4 and while loop there is no doubt Loop in Python two Loops four and while loop these we have discussed now as we know the execution of loops means why we need Loops actually if you want if you want that some statements for a block of code you want to execute that code repeatedly multiple times then you can put that code into a loop either for Loop or while loop and those line would be executed again and again right like until a specific condition is satisfied and all right the working you know very well so if you have like here we have Loop while or do I Loop and within this block I am having statement one like statement one two three four five five statements in this block all the fives are obviously indented so if the condition is true we will enter here then this condition would be executed then this then this then this then this then again next iteration then next then next iteration then all the five conditions like this if this condition is false then exit from the loop something like this we are having right now if if you want to you know change this flow of execution of this Loop if you want to change it from its normal way this is normal execution it's normal way then we use some control statements see as the name suggests Loop control statements means with the help of these statements basically these statements you know help us to gain better control on our Loop right that is why they are known as Loop control statements they can control the loop you know control the way of execution of the loop so three basically Loop control statements are there break continue and pass in Python so these will be discussing in this video with the help of programs and practical uh practically I'll show you right now see there are some situation when you want to exit from the loop completely when an external you know condition trigger then you want to exit the loop completely right so in that case we use break for that we have a statement control statement break or sometimes you want to skip a section of the loop or skip some part of the Loom and start the next iteration in that case also for that also we have a control statement continue sometimes we want to do nothing and then we have passed okay that's you know sounds weird if you want to do nothing then use pass statement what is the use of this pass okay this thing you will get with the help of program right now I hope you have now the basic idea of these three statements right discuss these statements one by one first we'll be seeing break so this control statement can be used only within four and while loop right as the name suggests break means exit from the loop immediately and once the program Encounters this break statement whatever statement you have written right after the loop body that would be executed like okay what is the syntax simply you will write break that's it right like in four we have a for Loop and I have written some code here 102 or line I don't know how many lines then suppose a condition occurs if I have some condition and within if this condition is true there I am using break and here I have some more code and after this see this is what block these lines are within this for Loop right and out of this four Loop suppose we have like outside Loop outside of you so if this we are entering if we are entering in the loop then this code would be executed then if this condition is true in that case we will enter here the control will enter here and break break means exit from this Loop so these statement would not be executed right because these are also part of this Loop and even though this condition is true it here it can be for Loop or while loop right both the loops can be there even though this condition is true here whatever you have written still break will cause out of the loop you know you have to exit from the loop right now so these statement would not be executed the remaining statement and whatever statement you will write right after this Loop body those would be executed this is what simply meaning of break right okay let's understand this thing with the help of flowchart suppose we are entering into a loop entry Loop so here we are having a test suppose some condition or expression we are having okay if this condition is true the two cases can be there true or false if false then simply exit from the loop exit from Loop note exit from program right if this condition is true and then we check if there is a break or not maybe some statement would be executed then would be checked break or not if yes if yes then exit from the loop no break then the remaining Loop body would be executed means remaining means here we have some more codes so this would be executed so this would be executed and then again here so this is you can say it's like a flow chart of break you can understand the working of this break statement with the help of this flowchart I guess okay now let me show you this thing with the help of two programs how we can use this break when within while loop within for loop as well as within nested Loop right let's see so let's create a new file here group control statements.py okay let's first we will be discussing now break so let's see with count sorry with while loop first we will see this one okay simple example will be taking while like count less than equal to 10 1 2 print I want to print the count value right but if once the count value becomes like once the count value becomes if this count equal to equal to 7. then break okay and still one more statement I am printing here like hi and out of the loop I am printing one more statement out from Loop simple example right in previous video also we have discussed this thing so let's run this and I'll show you what output you will get here see one high too high then three again high would be printed four five six once six the control you know you know the value becomes six so first it will print six it will print 6 and then this statement six plus one is seven now if condition would be checked seven count equal to equal to seven yes condition true then break break means just exit from this Loop so this print hi this would not be executed right whatever the statement immediately you have written after this Loop body that is this one that would be executed out from Loop right so this is our break would work in for Loop also we can use this thing or in nested Loop also we can use this thing so let's see one uh with nested loop I am using two for Loop nested for Loop so if sorry four uh first thing I am having a suppose two list so list one okay so I'll be having two list in list one I'm having like hi hello welcome and in second is names three name I'm having Krishna RAM and mother so one for Loop like I want to print something like this hi Krish hi Ram hi madhav then hello Krish hello Ram hello Mother then welcome Christian welcome Ram welcome like this so for that one for Loop two nested Loop we will use so for any variable name suppose item in list one right and one more for Loop here four variable I'm taking name in names see the difference names and here item name I'm taking just just name so simply we'll be printing print item comma whatever the name is right but within this inner for Loop I'm writing one condition if if like this item equal to equal to hello and suppose name equal to equal to Ram if this is the condition then break right and after this after from an outside of these four Loops nested Loops from this from this Loop outside of the loop body just after these nested Loops I am just printing print out from Loop right or better for better understanding let's do one thing see this within this inner for Loop we have these three statements so outside of this for loop with from this inner for Loop I'm writing one statement print out from inner loop right and this this is the statement out from Outer Loop this is out from inner loop here and this is out from Outer Loop right so let's run this and see what output you will get here see first first see the list one would be replaced with this complete list hi hello welcome so first what is the working of for Loop high would be assigned to item right hi in this list yes condition true enter here then one more for Loop the in names rather than names we have Krishna Ram madhav so firstly in name I am having creation so Krishna in names yes condition tree both the condition to enter here then it will print item item is high and name value is now crashed so it will print high creation right as you can see now see this condition is satisfied no then no break right then obviously we are within the inner loop so we are not out from this inner loop so again now next time in names Ram would be assigned so it will print hi Ram still this condition is not true so in names still we have madhav so it will print hi madhav check this condition not satisfied so no break right now end of the list end of the list means we are now out from this inner loop so it will print out from inner loop but we are still within this outer loop so next time now hello would be assigned to this item right and for hello same condition same you know that would be repeated same process would be repeated right so first of all hello Krishna then hello Ram but this time this condition is also satisfied item is hello and name is Ram yes condition is satisfied now break so here what you have to understand is break means it's not like that out from both the loops no this break is we are using within this inner loop obviously obviously this inner loop is within this outer loop but the nearest Loop to this break is this inner loop so we are out from the inner loop only not from Outer Loop so it will not print now hello madhav it will simply break exit from this inner loop so it will print out from inner loop out from inner loop but we are still in Outer Loop so next it will print same list one welcome would be assigned so for welcome also same condition same stay would be repeated welcome question then Ram then mother then out from a minute Loop out from outer loop so I hope you would if you use this break with a nested Loop means will be out from the nearest Loop so a break is within this inner loop so we are out from inner loop only not from Outer Loop so in for Loop also we can use a break something like this so I hope you got these two you know examples of break statement next is continue so the next statement is continue continuous you can say it's opposite of break statement break means exit from the loop continue means continue with the next iteration right not exit from the loop continue continue but with the next iteration uh like this same example if I take here we have maybe four Loop or while loop okay same example like this this is what a block within this for Loop or while loop I don't know anything Loop you can take so what is the uh the the flowchart or working of this continue statement if suppose any how the condition is true or within four Loop maybe four I enlist or anything if this something we have entered into this Loop condition is true satisfied so that is why we have entered into this Loop code would be executed then some specific condition external condition would be triggered if this condition is true then enter here and it will find continue in the previous case break means outside of the loop here but here we have continue continue means whatever statement is written just after this continue within this Loop within this block of the loop those would be skipped and it will control the ego at the beginning of the loop means the next iteration would be executed I hope you got the working right okay let's uh the same flowchart we are having same like we are having the test condition or that text expression after entering into the loop entry Loop okay so after entering the loop test the condition will be checked if this is true enter into the loop if false then simply exit from Loop right and again we'll check if within this Loop we have any continuous statement if yes if yes then control will go at the beginning of the loop just skip the remaining body of the loop the remaining body right means we have written some more codes so this would not be executed control will go here and next iteration would be started so here we have remaining Loop body if yes then continue if no no then this body would be executed and then obviously again the next iteration so this is the flowchart of continue I hope now you can figure out the difference between the break statement and continue statement with the help of this flowchart right let's discuss this with the help of program the same example we have taken with break then you will get it better the difference between break and continue Okay so let's take this example same example here count from 1 to 10. right but here rather than break just replace this with continue just to see the difference what will happen so if count is equal to is equal to 7 then continue write continue means once the program the control find continue it will skip whatever you have written just after this continue within this Loop and it will start it will start with the next iteration it will go from into the beginning of the loop at the beginning of the loop right okay let's run this see what output you will get here one then high would be printed C see count is one condition true it will print one then count becomes two then this condition true no so after this we have one more statement within this Loop hi so that would also be executed then one high again now count value becomes 2 so condition would be checked two printed count becomes three condition satisfied no then high would be printed so one then High then two then High then three high four high five high now six after six see there is no high after seven it's high so once it will print 6 then count plus one it becomes count becomes what seven now count become seven now check this condition next statement is Count equal to equal to seven yes condition true continue continue means it will skip whatever statement you have written just after continue within this Loop so only one statement is there high within this Loop so this would be skipped and it will continue with the next iteration right so after six no high would be printed it will go to the here beginning of the loop now at this point of time count value is seven so seven condition two yes so it will print seven directly now 7 after this count becomes 8 so this condition is not true so then high would be printed okay it will not exit from the loop if there is break then here it will exit from here after six it will print directly out from Loop but it will this while loop will go till 10. and then out from Loop so I hope now you got the difference between you know continue and break statement if you want to exit from the loop completely based on some external condition use break if you want to skip only some part of the loop here I have skipped this part of the loop if this condition is satisfied skip this part if you want to skip or bypass a section of the loop and continue with the next iteration then just use continue statement right like the same same thing you can do with for Loop also something like this uh like I have four I in range ranges from 1 to 10 I want to print so 1 to 11 I should take so if I value equal to equal to 7 then continue else simply print I value that's it let's run this okay we haven't printed High one two three four five six and seven is not printed eight nine ten so if you want to print number from 1 to 10 but not seven then this something like this if I is equal to 7 simply continue continue means this part would not be executed print I right and just continue with the next iteration right so I becomes now 8 and 8 will be printed something like this so let's see now pass statement okay so the next one is pass means do nothing means it's like a null operation like say let's take one real life example if there is sale going on right on Flipkart or Amazon any you know website and right now I don't need any let's say kurti right or any top or any kurti right now but if there is say like fifty percent off then I'll purchase that maybe in future I can use that kurti so right now I don't need that one means it has nothing to do with me the kurti but I still purchase that one for future reference right in future I'll use I'll wear that kurti yeah I know that is not a good idea it's waste of money but it's just an example so same maybe this weekend in future maybe I want to you know use a function right but right now I don't know what is the working of that function so to Define an empty function we can use pass to Define an empty Loop we can use pass right something like this uh like this if I have a four Loop 4 I in range 5. I want to use this Loop in future but I don't know what to do in this Loop right now I don't know so if you leave it something like this then it will give indentation error because after this colon it will need an intent intended block so you have to write down something so simply write down here pass means nothing to do with this Loop right now it's an empty Loop but in future I can replace this pass the statement with some meaningful statements according to my need right so it's like just uh you can say placeholder for future right if you want to Define an empty function then also you can use although we haven't discussed function but no this is a simple example how to define def function name suppose Function One and I don't know what to do with this function in future but I want this function in future but right now I don't know what to do with this function so I cannot leave this simply like this because it will be valid so pass means it's an empty function future I can replace this pass statement with some meaningful statement like in future maybe in the program in future I can replace this pass with simply print hi yeah it doesn't make any sense just an example so I have replaced this with some statement right so I hope you got it why we use this pass control statement let's discuss this with the help of example program I'll show you practically okay so let's see this example only I have for written an empty Loop for I in range this but I don't I don't know right now that I want to do something like this I don't know what to do like I want to do something do something but that's something right now I don't know in future I'll replace this do something with something meaningful so I want to write down right now an empty Loop so for empty Loop if we cannot leave this something like this because it will give an error if I run this there would be indentation error after this four expected indented block so what is the thing right thing for this just use this control statement pass let's run this it will print nothing see it's an empty Loop right or same here also uh let me just do this thing if count equal to equal to 7 I don't know what to do here right now I don't know if count is seven I want to continue or I want to break or I want to do something else I don't know right now but in future I'll replace this thing with something so I cannot leave this something like this it will give error obviously it will give error so pass pass mean just passes pass it do nothing right so here it will do nothing it will simply print one two 10. and high obviously one high two High three High like this one to ten and high and out from Loop so what is use of this condition here right now nothing maybe you will say like just remove these two statements now why you are writing this thing because it is simply working of this while loop but maybe in future I want this if statement here and I want to do something so just for reference just it's a placeholder just a placeholder right like I will do nothing just pass it if you want to you know Define uh like there is a function and suppose in that function I want to call another function but right now I'm not sure what is that that calling function will do right so you can simply pass that thing right to write down an empty class or empty control statement empty Loop empty function empty method you can use this pass I hope now you got what is the meaning of this pass statement here okay like if you want to Define an empty function just there and function name suppose function one here this but I don't know what this function should do right now so let's do pass here if you do something like this it will give error if you you know keep it something like this it will give indentation error indented block after this function expected intended block after this function so just use pass statement it will not give any error so in future you can replace this pass statement with some meaningful code one two three four five six lines of code I don't know how many lines of code I don't know what this function will do in future but yeah I will use this function in future that is for sure or maybe you can delete this later so I hope now you got what is break continue and pass statement so I hope you got the working of these three rule Loop control statement break and then you pass and how to use them when to use them and all the difference between these three so now I'll see in the next video till then bye take care
