so in this video I'm going to discuss how I cleared gate exam what was my preparation strategy to crack gate exam because I'm getting many messages on my Instagram account that mum please make a video on some tips how to prepare for gate exam as well as have you cleared your gate exam what was your preparation strategy means how much hours you use to study at that time and everything so first of all in this video I will discuss my preparation strategy and in next video I will discuss how to prepare for gate exam some simple tips and tricks you should go for watching or not and how many hours you should study in a day or how many months it required to crack gate exam it is possible to Craig Craig gate exam in first attempt or not and you know everything every type of questions that we'll discuss in next video so actually my score in gate exam was around 94th percentile right so I can't say it's very good or we can't say it's bad average score was there right till my final year I haven't decided that I want to go for gate exam right so generally students to what in third year only they decided that they want to go for two gate exam and they start preparing for gate exam but I haven't decided till my final year so around September in final year and Athene around September mid September I decided that I want to go for gate exam so at that time I was having only four months Ashley October November December January because it I think on 8th or fab my gate exam was there so I was not having much time so that is why I did what I went for coaching but weekend coaching on Saturdays Sundays only my class timing was 8 o clock in the morning from 8 o clock in the morning to 500 or somewhere around 6 o clock in the evening so now you can calculate I was having only 4 months so how many classes I have attended around 30 classes 28 or 30 classes I ever attended and till 15th of January because obviously you need some time to revise those subject it's not like that paneer so fab you have your gait examined till six or seven you are completing your slippers you are not revising the concepts no that is the biggest mistake if you do so hey I don't want to say that you must go for watching to graduate exam my reason was different because I was not well prepared for the gate exam I was having only four months and obviously to prepare for any gate exam or any use in that exam I have already discussed in my previous video also that in that we do have discussed how to prepare for you the CNET exam obviously you need material some good material organized in an organized way you have to analyze the previously previous your question paper which type of questions are being asked and the weight is of each subject you have to identify in which subject you are strong you have to devote much time to which subject obviously you have to plan everything but and I was not having much time to do this thing and seriously I was not you know at that time you can say I was not a selfmotivated kind of person that I can do this thing that is why I decided to go for coaching but weekend coaching on Saturday Sunday is only so my motto to go for coaching go just to have that material you should go for if you want to go for coaching you should go for a good coaching or aptitude coaching that have some you know renowned history so I decided to join coaching to get that material and Moke tests as well right and obviously in coaching they also tell you some tips and tricks some short breaks and which type of questions are being asked and everything that is why I went for coaching but it's not like that that only coaching can with only coaching you can craft any exam coaching plus selfstudy you require i have already uploaded a video on coaching versus selfstudy you can just you can watch that video in this I button so now comes to slippers I haven't covered the entire slavers actually and that is the you know main point 100 mark because now the gate paper is of 100 marks I guess and 65 questions are being asked right so it's not like that you should aim for the hundred marks or 99 marks if you wanna go for IITs and IISc s then I can say above sixty marks are fine to get into those I guess for IITs above fifty five marks out of hundred and if you wanna get into ia SC in that case I think you need about sixty five marks or around seventy but I'm not much sure about this that thing we will discuss in next video I have to do some research on this thing but I guess these kind of marks are required so three sections are there in this exam one is your general aptitude next is your engineering mathematics and subject specific so from subject specification around nine subjects are there from those subjects I have prepared I was good in data structure in programming so I prepared those things computer networks database right and digital logic algorithms operating system and computer organization and architecture although I was not good in CoA but to some extent I have prepared that thing but I have left TOC and compiler design entirely because I was not good in those subjects and I was having less time so it's better if this is the case it's better to focus on your strong sections so I haven't prepared that time see TOC and your compiler design right general aptitude in this section they test your availability and numerical ability so I was good in this section so that was a plus point for me in engineering mathematics the sections are discrete mathematics calculus linear algebra and probability I was not good in probability so I went touched probability little bit I was good in calculus so I have tried that thing also but linear algebra and digital mathematics I was good in those subjects so I prepared for that one those sections in from this engineering maths so the point here is what I haven't prepared all the subjects I just focused on those subjects in which I was good I was strong and obviously all the students who are going forget examine at exam they should do this thing so 10 2015 of January around 15,000 Ameri I have attended the classes and then 15 to 20 days I devoted for revision this thing is very important for any exam preparation right and when I was attending the classes at that time I used to take my you know notes from those classes with different different kind of pen and markers I used to highlight important formulas or any tricks or anything which I think that it's important or which the faculty used to tell us that this thing is important forget exam so I used to mark that thing or I used to write down that thing in this kind of box so at the time of revision these kind of things will help you so in 15 to 20 days I revised the subjects and at that time also for those important points I have prepared separate notes right like I have taken one subject that is I'm really I'm revising computer networks so from my notes that I used to prepare in my class at the time of coaching from that notes I have prepared small notes they use they were having only that important formula as some tricks or some important points that can only like this from all the subjects I did this for all the subject like computer networks and DBMS and operating system and everything so that sometimes what we do when we go for the exam on that day also we used to study the things before getting in entry into the examination hole till that point so at that time you can use your these kind of notes small notes just to you know revise the important things the important formulas or the short tricks and these kind of things so this is going to help you definitely if you do this thing and on weekdays generally I used to study to be very honest three to four sorry but say this time depends on student to student I was good in my academics that is why my basics and my concepts was clear so I used to study only through to for us maybe someone are not good so strong in basics and someone is not so good in academics so you have to spend five to six hours so seven to eight hours in a day so it depends on you you have to analyze your capability you have to and analyze yourself so in brief my strategy was just four months weekend coaching's three to four hours a day forgetting them and I got around 94% I ring gate so next video we are going to discuss how to prepare for gate exam you generally have to prepare for gate exam some tips and tricks you should follow if you are going for the gate exam right so now I'm going to see you in the next video till then bye bye take care
