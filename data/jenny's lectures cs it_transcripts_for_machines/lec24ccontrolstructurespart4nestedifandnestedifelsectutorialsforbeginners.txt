so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing control structures in c plus plus till now we have discussed simple if statement if else and elsif letter so now the next is nested if and nested if else yes we can do nesting of if as well as nesting of effects now what is this nested in what is nested if else why to use these when to use this how to use these uh these statements in your program right everything about these statements we'll be discussing in this video video with the help of a program i'll show you practically also we'll see with the help of program and we'll relate these thing with the help of you know real life examples also right so now before i just want to tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate 2023 exam will be preparing for your gate 2023 exam then geeks for geeks is conducting a gate csol india scholarship test on 6th of august right and best part is it is free you can take this test for free it will be contained you know consisting 24 questions time limit would be one hour and mark's total marks are 120 marks so uh this test would be you can see it's a miniature version of real gate exam simulation of real gate exam so if you take this online online exam then definitely it is going to you know boost your gate exam preparation and you will like i will provide you you know admission to one of the best gate live batches with amazing discounts and this test consists of complete 20 gay 2023 slavers and similar question pattern of you know real gate computer science exam it has been exclusively you know made by their gate toppers and experts so what benefits you will get if you go for this test top three rankers will get 30 scholarship then 4 to 10 rankers will get 20 scholarship and uh and after that 11 to 50 rankers will get 10 percent scholarship so all the relevant links and details i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is this nester defend yesterday's statements nested of it means see one if we have within this if we have one more if within this we have one one more this is what called as nested and nested defense means one we have if then we have some condition within this if we have one more if else if right then else and closing of the set after that else this else is for this if within this else we have like if else this is something like nested if else this is nested if only we are just nesting if only right so nested if it is also possible nested if s is also possible now when when to use these kind of things why we use these things see when we have more than one condition right and these conditions are dependent on each other then we use the scenario nested if scenario right now let's take one condition and till how many levels you can nest this if it's unlimited like if if if within this if you can write down multiple you know nesting you it is possible it is not limited right now let's take a scenario see your mom will say like your mother say if you go to supermarket right first condition is if go to supermarket then if orange is available then buy oranges right so one one condition is if go to supermarket then one more if like apple apples available then buy so this if is you can say inner right and this is outright so to enter into this inner if this outer if condition must be true in this case also to buy oranges you have to go to supermarket so if this condition is true if you are going to supermarket then only you can buy oranges if you don't go to supermarket then definitely we are not going to enter into this if block and no execution of this nrf statement in a if condition directly we will go out whatever you write here after this if blow right so to execute the nrf condition to check the inner if condition the outer if condition must be true thus you need to take care right for more nesting you can do like if go to supermarket if like good apples available like if apple available then we'll check if quality is good then only buy so this is also nesting of if right so this if condition is if good good apples available for this condition to be true the outer if condition must be true if apples are not available in the supermarket then how you can check that apples the quality is good or bad so for this condition to be true or to be checked this outer if condition must be true apple must be available in supermarket then only you can check if these are good or bad so when we have multiple conditions more than one condition to check and these conditions are dependent on each other then we use these kind of scenario nested if a nested defense yeah we can do these kind of things with another scenario also that we'll discuss in the at the end of this video but first i think it is clear to you how to use and when to use this nested if and nested if else statements right so see general generally if i write down so if like condition one then one more if if condition two right like this if condition 3 like this it will be going on and at last suppose if condition n and within this i'm writing statement n right and closing of all the if and after this if block i am just writing a statement statement x so this is nested of f only up to n level you can nest so how you can you know map this with help of a flowchart see this is suppose we are executing the program the entry then we got condition one this one two cases can be there right if this is true if this condition is true then only we will enter then we got second condition okay condition 2 if this is true then only we will enter here then condition 3 and up to condition n so like this up to condition n now if this condition is true then statement n would be executed and after statement end obviously out of this if and then statement x statement x but second case is if the first condition is false if this condition is false definitely we will not these inner if a condition will not be checked this would not be executed directly control will go out of this statement to statement x okay now in case if this condition is false if true next condition would be checked if false if false in that case within the block we are not writing you know we are not writing any statements like we have written within this this this block statement n same you can write like statement 1 statement 2 like this but we are not writing any statements so directly if false directly it will go to statement x out of this if block same if this condition n is true directly will go to statement x and after that maybe exit or further we can execute the program this would be you can say a flowchart of nested or if right same for if else i have shown you how to write down this thing if condition 1 then if another condition right then you can say here is some statements you can say in a riff of if block statement right and then else and here you will write inner else of if block statement or rather than this you can write like statement x statement y statement abc something like this right then we write else then again we write if condition three if and else block like this you will write if else nesting of your files so now it is assignment for you guys you have to map this thing into this kind of flowchart i hope you can do this we have discussed many type of flowcharts in this video also we have discussed one and before that also we discussed so i guess you have some idea now now you can map this process in this flowchart just map this this is assignment for you guys and just send me maybe one in the comment section or a screenshot you can send on my instagram account right now let's do practical of this thing let's take a simple example and let's write a program so this is a program let me just first tell you the scenario we are discussing nested of offense so the condition is if the same example you are taking if you have money greater than thousand rupees right then second condition is you have to check if your partner age is greater than 21 then you can take wine else coffee in starbucks right else in else part if you have money greater than 500 then you can take coffee in ccd else in a normal shop you can take coffee and then let's go home this is the scenario in this spectrum in this program we have one more factor that is you have to check age also h bar is also there so i guess the both thing is clear to you hash include iostream.h then namespace std then main in main we are writing like we are taking two variables money and partner age so first of all we will ask enter money right if money greater than equal to thousand rupees then ask enter your partner age if this condition is true then only we will ask partner age enter the partner age if that is greater than 21 then let's have wine else let's have coffee let's have coffee in starbucks that's right now now in this else part again we are writing if else within the cells again we are writing if so this is what nested defense if money greater than 500 then coffins is ready l swapping any normal shop and let's go home right now let's run this and see what output will get here see first of all it is asking enter money i'm entering 1200 i have then it will ask enter partner age partner age is 20 so let's have coffee in starbucks and after that what the statement we have written out of this if else block let's go home so that would also be printed let's go right now let's run this again enter money i have suppose uh 600 so first condition is not true so now it will not ask the partner age 600 then coffee in ccd and let's go okay 600 means this condition is true else money greater than 500 yes this condition is true so enter into this else into this if block coffin ccd after that after that just exit from the this outrails and let's go home right let's run this again and suppose i have 100 rupees so coffee in any normal shop and let's go i hope now you would why to use and how to use this uh nested defense we have now more than one condition money as well as age of the partner and this is dependent on each other right if you don't have money greater than 1000 rupees you don't need to check your partner age right if below thousand then you can have only coffee in ccd or any normal show right if more than thousand then only the dependent condition is what you have to check the partner age for that this for this inner if condition for execution of this inner if this outright must be true right before checking the partner age your money you have more than thousand rupees in your pocket right now say i think you can do an example with nested of nested if rather than if else right so if if you know we are not writing any else statement if and if only if and if and after that the just close no else and else part yesterday that is yesterday so now how you can do this thing this is your your assignment you have to do this program with the help of nested a phone right like if money greater than thousand then if partner is greater than this then let's have this let's have this thing no else part or three nested if also you can do three or four nested it right it's not like that you have to take this example only you can take another example also according to that you can do your program but you have to practice this thing instead of if i hope you can do this now now rather than you rather than using this nested if what you can use you can use a logical land operator see if go to supermarket and orange is available and good orange is available then buy that's it within a single if statement you can write down all the three two you know three four five conditions so to check these more than one condition which are dependent on each other you can use logical and operators simple i have already discussed a video in this like operator what is logical and how to use this so you can try out this thing with your own rather than using nested if first of all try to write a program to you know uh using yesterday then do that program write that program without necessarily with the help of single if statement and use logical and operator right like if you go to supermarket and apple available both the conditions are true then only you can buy same thing in yesterday false you can do if go to supermarket within that more if if orange is available then buy same thing right i hope you go to this point so let's you have to try this program at your own right so in the next video we'll see switch case statements so answer the next video till then bye take care
