hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language in the previous video we have seen what is recursion and what are recursive function right how to create a recursive function how to use recursion to solve a problem right so based on that we we'll be discussing one coding exercise in this video and what you have to do is you have to write down a program to find sum of digits of a given number using recursion right for example if input is given something like this if input is 3 4 32 then output should be 4 + 3 + 2 that is 9 if input is suppose something like this 7 1 2 this is input so output should be 7 + 1 + 2 that is 10 right sum of digits of a given number you got it now what you have to do now please what is that right approach to solve a problem now take a paper and pen and think what should be the logic don't just directly jump to your laptop and just in this Visual Studio code and start writing code no you have to think first of all on paper right think how to suppose this number is given then how you will find out different different digits of this number like two then three then four and how you will you know going to add these individual digits right so post the video and try this out so I hope you have done this see if number is let's take number is 4 32 how we will find out the individual digits so we know uh one operator is there module operator right so if I divide this number like 4 3 2 mode 10 this mode operator will give remainder so the remainder of this is two you got it so this will give me two like maybe I can store this number somewhere right then after that after that in 43 do I want now three now right so after that if I divide 43 if I do something like this mode 10 then it will give me three after that just four mode 10 so obviously it's not divisible so remainder would be four so now I got these three individual digits and I can just add these things right so okay one operator we will use mode operator but after this 432 how you will get 43 because the number is 432 now but after getting two I want the number should be 43 only and after that number should be four only right this is how this is possible so just think we can apply one more operator that is divide operator so if I do something like this 432 divide by 10 then it will give me 43 see this is modular operator and this is divide operator divide by right so divide by 10 so it will like 43.2 but if I take int only obviously then 43 only I will get right and after that 4 3 divide by 10 it would be 4.3 and integer is four so we'll take only four like this so these two operator you need to use right I hope now you got something about like this Sol solution of this problem divide operator then apply modul divide then apply modul and just add these numbers that's it this you have to do so if you haven't done this yet pause the video now and try this out try to you know write down this on a piece of paper right writeen that and then your laptop fine so I hope you have done this let's try this out I just want to print like see out let's have a function name sum of digits and 4 32 I just want to pass and it should give me whatever the answer is right so okay we are calling here so let's define this function of this thing is main so int so name is same as it is parameter one I'm passing so int now I'm going to take right now you have to apply mode operator and divide operator right and using recursion you have to do recursion you have to do this thing right so what basically here we are doing is what it should return return whatever the number 432 mode 10 4 32 mode 10 we will get 2 2 plus we are going to add 2 plus now now the number is 43 43 mode 10 we'll get three and plus now the after applying division operator the number is four and simply we get four so num more 10 plus now we want number should be only 43 and how you will get 43 you have to divide that number by 10 simple so again call this function sum of doit and what you will pass here num divide by 10 that's it I hope you got it this is the simple logic see the beauty of recursion if you use iterative approach that is also not very tough like simply one while group and two to three lines and that's it but you can try out that iterative approach as well to find out some of digits but here one important thing is what is the base case now you have to write down the base case when to stop right so base case is if after divide by 10 number becomes 43 again divide by 10 number becomes 4 again divide by 10 number and then it becomes that uh 4 divide by 10 it becomes zero so once you reach to zero stop right so if number equal to equal to Z simply return zero that's it let's run this and see what output we getting C for 9 we are getting here right nine okay let's change this uh if the number is 4 3 2 1 so obviously it should give 10 so let's run this and see see 10 right I hope you got this if you haven't got this then please pause the video dry this and try this out and let me just try this for you if you want to continue watching you can just you know continue watching this video otherwise you can stop so see what is happening here at first control will be here like we'll go to this Main and here we have see out some of like uh function call so at first like in this stack we have one activation record for main right and here we are simply calling this function sum of digits s so I'm simply writing and here we have 4 3 2 1 right so we are calling this so for this 4 32 1 we have an activation record control will go to here in Num so here we have here we have num num is 432 let's consider it only till two right not to one because it's going to take more time now so here we have num is 432 right this condition true no now return num mode 10 now mode 10 4 3 2 mode 10 it will give you two so it will return what two plus sum of digits again this function called s o num divide by 10 so rather than this 432 divide by 10 means it will give 43 so here 43 now 43 would be passed so the next activation record s o this would be for 43 so here we have num 43 this condition true no again num mode 10 so num mode 10 it will give you three plus s o we are calling s o 43 sum of Digit 43 divide by 10 it will give you four so here we have four so next activation record s o here number is four so we have one here num is equal to 4 so what it will return is this condition true no it will return n mode 10 4 mode 10 remainder is what four only right mode will give you remainder remember this thing so remainder is four plus s o number four divide by 10 it will Zero divide by 10 is Zer because we are not able to divide this so Zer so next activation record is for s o 0 so here we have number is equal to Z now see the condition base case condition number equal equal to Z yes stop return zero so this from here from here it will return this function will return zero from where it will return here we are calling this so here it will return zero it will return zero and after returning sorry after returning just this activation record would be cleaned right would be popped out I mean poed up from the step now 4 + 0 where this would be return this function we are calling this function from where from here so 4 + 0 is 4 so it will return 4 here it will turn four here right and after that obviously this would be popped out I mean this is out from the stack now s o this this is four this is four the value of this is now 4 + 3 is 7 where it will return here because here I'm calling this 43 so it is seven and after this it will be popped out mean this is out of the St 7 + 2 is 9 so it will return this thing here so here it is nine and this will be popped out means out of the step now nine we simply print C out some of that and it will n and this main is also out of SL now our stack is empty there is nothing in our stack right so all the memory all the memory for local variables are free now and the value is the output is nine I hope you got this how you are getting this nine right so now one if you got this now one question for you is one assignment for you is you have to write down a program to find out sum of N natural number so if the input input is how many natural number right so we'll ask from the user suppose I I enter 10 so you have to find out some till 1+ 2+ 3 till 10 if I ask some for 15 natural numberb so 1+ 2+ 3 up to up to up to 15 this you need to give using recurs right you got it now now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see one more coding exercise on recursion so now I'll see in the next by bye take care
