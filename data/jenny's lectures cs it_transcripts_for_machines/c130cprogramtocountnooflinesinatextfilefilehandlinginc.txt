so in the series of running c programming we are almost done with every concept of file ending in c right i will discuss two to three or five or six programs on file handling first i will discuss some simple program two to three programs then we will see some complicated programs or if you want me to upload any video on some specific program then you can tell me in comment box i'll try to upload that video also so in this video you will see how to count number of lines in a file you are given a file and you are supposed to count how many lines are there in that file we will see the logic here then i'll show you practical also right on my laptop now before that this one tell you one thing as we know day 2022 exam is going on so an academy is conducting some sessions on gay 2022 exam analysis or you can say exam solution discussion these are live sessions and these are conducted by the academy's top educators right after the examination and you can enroll for these sessions for free so here you will get solution of all the questions so you can easily you know predict how how many questions you go to write and about your about your rank and score everything more thing if you are going to start preparation for gate 23 and 2024 exam then an academy has started some batches for these aspirants also in these batches their top educators will be covering all the subjects of cs and it and in this course you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts plus separate doubt clearing session would also be conducted so you can get your doubt cleared in those sessions but these are paid subscriptions but you can use micro jkl10 to get 10 discount on your paid subscriptions and an academy is also going to conduct a combat on 6th of february at 11 am it is a live test and you can take this test for free so here you will get a chance to compete with thousands of learners from all over india and you stand a chance to win up to 100 scholarship plus some exciting prizes as well and after every combat you will get detailed video solutions by their experts so you can identify your weak areas and you can improve according to that plus they are also offering you a super combo offer in which if you buy two years of gate and esc subscription you will get one year extra subscription for free for campus placement and i.t jobs and if you buy one year of gate and esc subscription you will get six months extra subscription free for campus placement and id jobs plus if you will use micro jkl 10 you will get extra 10 off so the price detail you can see on my screen so all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's see this program see suppose i have a file the name of file is abc.txt right and in this file i have suppose this hi then help then how many lines we have two so the output should be program output of the program should be two now suppose i have high hello then we have a new line operator but i have nothing in this line in this line and after that i have jenny so now here i have one two one this line three i have nothing in this one line but this is a line three and four so it should give four right and if i do something like this like hi hello then new line but nothing in this line the new line jenny then again new line and cursor is here then total line are 1 2 3 4 5 right that should be the output or if suppose i have nothing in this and cursor is here then still we have one line right nothing is there but still it is having one line so it should print one line so we are supposed to write down such kind of program to you know get output of this suppose i have high and hello so it should give two line and the cursor is here so how you will write down that program see means new line starts if suppose after high i have pressed and pressed a new line operator like enter that is new line means we are in the next line so as soon as we find a slash n the new line operator means there is a line we are supposed to count that thing right so how many slash n are there you are supposed to count that thing also but here we have only one slash n one slash n after this like one enter then hello and the cursor is here so slash n is the new line is only one so if i say that just count new line and those are number of lines but here slash n is only one so number of line it should it will print one but here we have two lines right so how it will print two lines that also will see right now but the logic is i hope you got this just count the new line operator and that's it right so how you will count we will read this line character we will read this file character by character that like first character is h then i next character is new line as soon as we get a new line just increase the count by one you are supposed to you know read all the characters till end of file till the character is end of five that's it you're supposed to put this thing in a while loop or for loop or two in which loop you are you know comfortable you can put that loop so same first of all obviously we are going to create a file pointer right and i am writing in count count is equal to 1 not 0 right i'll tell you why after that can ch just to read a character because i'm reading a character so obviously we are going to store that character into a variable right now just open the file f open function abc dot txt and in read mode i am opening i am just reading reading the content now correct by character and i am just you know counting the slashing but if f p is equal to is equal to null simply you can print some error while opening this file or cannot open file and exit from this point only right otherwise just put a while loop or for loop or do while loop in which you are interested suppose i am taking while loop why character by character we are going to read so how to read a single character from a file the function is f get c right and whatever you will read the character we are going to store that in c so cs is equal to f get c and just pass here the file pointer not equal to end of phi uf is end of phi till then we are going to run this loop right as soon as this character we are going to fetch that is end of i stop right now in this while loop also we are going to count number of lines so the condition is if the character you are fetching is slash n so just put if this ch is equal to is equal to slash n because it is a character so put it in single quote then simply what you have to do just do what count plus plus or count is equal to count plus one we are going to increment the count value that's it right fine and this is close of this while loop also right just simply we are going to close the file f close and what you are supposed to print the count value so simply in f what you can write percentage d and count or you can say the number of lines are properly you can write number of lines are percentage d and count right and that's it so see what will happen if successfully f open has opened this file then we are out of this if loop means this if statement and this while loop would be executed because we have successfully opened this file so now fgtc will fetch h in ch we have now h it is end of phi character is end of phi no right so means h not equal to end of phi obviously it is not equal to endo file means condition is true yes so condition 2 means we are going to enter into this while loop now see if c s is equal to is equal to slash n ch is h is it slashing no so we are not going to enter into this loop out of this if block and after that again what again fetch a character next character is i i not equal to end of phi yes condition true again enter is it slash n no again we are going to fetch now i after i we have slash n new line operator it is end of file no means true slash and not equal to end of five means condition two we are going to enter into this if ch is equal to is equal to slash n yes it is true so now we are going to enter into this if block can count plus plus so count is one one plus one is equal to two right now again fetch a character now slash n means now when you again h would be fast then e then l l then o and after that this is what end of phi so once we reach here the character is end of file yes endo file would be there fine and end of file not equal to end of phi no condition is not true so we are not going to enter into this while loop so now exit from this while loop f close and simply print count value now count is equal to two so one two it will print two now if you will press here also enter or slash n and simply your cursor is here so how many line it should print here not two lines here we have three lines logically we have three lines but in third line we don't have anything in vs code editor also like if you will open any you know text file then here they'll give num the line number like one two three so here they will give three lines so same after this slash n means count plus plus again so two plus three it becomes three now in this line also it is what end of file so simply it will print 3 1 2 3 that is why i am taking count is equal to 1 note 0 if you have nothing in this file then cs is equal to f gate c but at starting only end of file so we are not going to enter into this while loop and simply print count so count value is one so it will print one if you have nothing in this file but still this one means cursor is here so it would consider it in a line but no there is no character the file is empty but still we have one line so it will print one so i hope you got the concept of how to you know count number of lines in a file it's very simple now suppose if i ask you count number of lines as well as number of characters i guess you can modify this program only you are supposed to you need to add a single line only single line in this program or maybe two line whatever you know variable you will use you are supposed to initialize you are supposed to initialize that variable also right declare that variable also right so you just have to declare a thing one more variable to count number of character and one line you are supposed to add in this while loop only and you are supposed to print i guess you can modify this this is assignment for you guys you can send me the code in the comment box so during my instagram account you can you can send me a message of that code you know that screenshot of that code so this you are supposed to do so count the number of lines as well as number of characters in this file or any file how to count right so let me show you practical of this program see this is the program we have right we have taken a variable n or you can say count and we have opened the file abc dot txt in our mode abc.txt we have hi hello right so the c two two lines are there so it should print two the output should be two right but the cursor here is after o here is the cursor only right so now see i'm just using a while loop while a variable i am taking c in c i am just reading a single character f get cfp not equal to end of phi till then this loop will be run and in loop i am writing if c is equal to is equal to slash n just do n is equal to n plus one or count plus plus whatever variable you will take just do plus one then close the file and simply print n value that's it so it should give 2 the output should be 2. let me just run this and show you what output you are getting see the lines are 2 but suppose i am going to update this just i am adding a slash and see the number is one two three means we here we have three line but in third line we don't have anything but the output should be obviously line is three lines are three so what it will print now let me just run this again and show you what output you will get see lines are 3 right if i updated something like this after hello one more after high one more space so total lines are 1 2 3 4 5 right so now let me just run this again and show you what output you are getting see lines are five fine and if you don't have anything like in this file we have nothing but still the line is we have one line but characters or you can see the file is empty but one line is still there so let me just run this again and show you the output see lines are one only right see the line number is also in vs correlator if you open the text file then it is also give you the line number so one i hope now you got this how to print number of lines if you want to you know find out number of character also just add or see if you will use this for loop then you can write down something like this rather than while loop if you are using for loop initialization c is equal to f gate c means one character i am reading the condition is that character is not equal to end of phi and what is the increment and decrement thing obviously we are not doing like c plus plus or c minus minus we are getting character by character so same c is equal to f get c f p we are we will get the next character that's it right so that is the condition the increment of decrement thing c is equal to i get cfp and same if loop you can if statement you can write down this for loop and that's it or you can do while looper you can write down do while loopholes right now you are supposed to update this thing and you are supposed to write down a program to count number of lines as well as number of characters in a file right if you are finding any difficulty in writing that program you can tell me in comment box i'll upload a separate video on that thing right and that's it for this video so now i'll see you in the next video with a new program till then take care bye
