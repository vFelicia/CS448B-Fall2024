so in the series of learning c plus programming language we are discussing control structures in c plus plus in the previous video we have discussed if statement that is you can say single selection statement you give some condition if that condition is true whatever you will write within that fifth block that will be executed right after that whatever statement you will write after a blog that will be executed right that is single selection now suppose you have two choices if this otherwise this in real life also we have these kind of choices so that you can you know implement in programming with the help of if else block or you can say if else statements so what is this fl statement how to use these statement in your program whatever you know some tricky things we can do with if else not just simply fails feel right same with if we have discussed with effects we will discuss what whatever tricky things we can do and whatever tricky type of questions an interviewer can ask from you or whatever kind of questions you will get in those competitive type of exams tricky questions although maybe you know it seems very simple if blog posts blog but they ask some tricky things you haven't seen those kind of things with you haven't tried even those kind of things with if block and else block or if else statements right so those thing also we'll discuss in this video with the help of a program all the points indeed we will discuss if else block now before that let me just uh tell you a website from which you can learn coding and practice some questions coding ninjas yes coding in jazz courses from basic to advanced level in programming in c plus java machine learning data science web development android development and it is one of the biggest coding education company which have taught around 50 000 students and the courses are very well structured for students and you will get here exceptional content the courses are very good curated by their experts from iit stand for amazon facebook one more thing you will get onetoone doubt resolution support your doubt will be resolved within one to two hours that is i guess a good point and thousand plus questions asked in the companies like google amazon microsoft and more to practice and also it is having very good rating on google and facebook so if students put right you know hard work and effort then these courses are i guess enough to create any tech job interview so you can use the link in the description box of this video to avail 50 discount on all the coding ninjas courses and this discount you can make this discount on about early bird so the all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is if else statement okay let's take first a real life example suppose uh your mo your mother asked you to go to supermarket and buy some vegetables you will say what i should buy so your mother will say like ladyfinger right mindy which is my favorite so and if you ask if bhindi is not available in them in that market then what else second choice is what then maybe your mother say like second choice is uh you can buy any you can say potato right so two choices you have first choice is lady finger if not available then potato otherwise okay you can go home in the previous case we have discussed if block in that case we have single selection means if you relate it with this example then your mother say if ladyfinger available then buy that thing no otherwise option no option you have no second choice you have if not available come to home right but here we have two choices so same these kind of sources we have in programs so to implement these kind of choices in real life we use otherwise word otherwise uh no word english word but here if you want to implement these two choices these kind of scenario in program then what you use if else statement if condition rather than otherwise we use here the keyword else right i hope you are going to relate this with this example right so now what is the general syntax how you write first of all you write if and then condition in these brackets the condition can be an expression or constant value right condition can be combination of and it can be combination of two or more condition right with logical and logical or operator you can combine these statement relational operator you can use with this condition but ultimately this condition should evaluate to boolean value either true or false so if condition then here we can say if block statements we write more than one statement you write then put it put this curly basis else else block statement this is general syntax to write this and after this you can say after if else block statement these statements are not part of this if else block right so what the working of this is what if this condition is true true then control will enter into this if block and whatever condition whatever statement you will write within this if looked those statement will be executed right and this else statement would be skipped right then after execution of this directly control will go to after if else block statement if the condition is false if the condition is false in that case this else part control will go to the else part and these statements would be executed these if statement would be skipped and after execution of the sales part the control will go to the after reference block statement so these after effects block statement would be executed after if the condition is true then also the condition is false then also right it doesn't matter condition is true or false these statement would be executed because these are part of program these are out of this effects block right so obviously two uh case can be there condition can be may be true or false right i hope you got the working of this let me just ah explain this with the help of flowchart ok we are just a program we have some statement in the program we are executing those statements and after that suddenly we find if condition so this is you can say you can say entry or you can say the program is going to be executed right then suddenly we find a condition so two cases can be there one can be false one can be true if true then this if block statements would be executed if false then else block statements would be executed right after that after if else block statements would be executed right after s block as well as after if block and after that if you have any other thing in the program those would be executed or you can say exit from the program right so this is simple working of fels block with the help of flowchart i hope you got the working now let me just write down a program and we will discuss this thing with the help of that program right let's take the same example we have taken in the previous video if you have money greater than more than thousand rupees then you will have coffee in starbucks otherwise you will have cofine ccd and then you will come home two choices you have starbucks and ccd right the condition is for going to starbuckses money should be greater than thousand so simply the logic i am writing if money greater than and equal to suppose thousand rupees right obviously i am not writing the whole program you have to write those header file then you have to initialize you have to declare this money main function and all you have to write right those who will discuss on my laptop if money greater than equal to thousand then i am going to print c out whatever money you have that you will print right and then see out coffee in starbucks right else same we will print c out whatever money you have that money i have and coffee in ccd and after that i'm just printing let's go home that's it right so if you enter like money 900 rupees 900 rupees the condition is not true so this if block would not be executed control will go to the else block and this would be executed so what will be printed money i have 900 rupees and kofi ccd and then this will be printed let's go home right these three see out would be executed if i enter money 1200 means condition now true 1200 so now this if block statement would be executed control will enter into the shift block money i have is 1200 then coffee in starbucks this else statement would not be executed after that directly control will go to the this part after if it fails block statement let us go home would be printed right now what tricky things you can do with this like if i put semicolon here what would be the output if i don't write semicolon here but semicolon here what would be the output if i put semicolon in both the cases what would be the output right if i remove these i'm not putting semicolon i'm removing these what would be the output right now i'm not removing these i'm removing these then what will be the output so these different type of you know things we can do with this but these things will discuss practically on my laptop so let's just run this program first okay so we have this program header file using namespace studio then main function i'm declaring a variable into money and i'm just asking from user how much money you have then we are entering the menu money we are taking the input using seen now checking the condition if money greater than equal to thousand then whatever it will print the money you have and then let's have coffee in starbucks else the money you have and let's have coffee in ccd and after that let's go home right simple now let's just run this see it is asking how much you have so i'm entering now 1200 so it will print money i have 1200 let's have coffee in starbucks and then let's go home after he fails blog if i again run this and how much you have i have 300 let's have the money i have is 300 let's have coffee in ccd now else part because condition is not real 300 is less than 1000 rupees you cannot have coffee in starbucks because omega let's go home right now second thing is what see if i put semicolon here sorry after this so means it will terminate okay i'm putting semicolon after this if block means it will terminate this if in the previous case when we were discussing if statement simply it will not give any error right it will terminate the same but in this case it will give error see this below this is else you can see a red line so it is an error whenever i run this see what error you will get else without a previous if you cannot write down because we have terminated this if there is no point of if now in this program means there is no f in this program now and we are using else so without if you cannot use else make this point as a note without if you cannot write down else but without else you can write down if that we have discussed in previous video you can write down if no need to write down else but without any previous if you cannot write down this else so it will give error save if you terminate this else also then also it will give error right although obviously you are using the cells you are terminating but you are using this else right and you are terminating this if here so it is not finding any previous so then also it will give error now if i not write here the semicolon after if but semicolon after else then it will not give any error but you have terminated now this else there is no use of this else now see it would be run if i run this then how much money you have suppose i write 1200 means condition is true it should execute only the if statement and after that after refill after effects block else statement else block statement would be skipped but now it will not skip this see money i have 1200 let's have coffee in starbucks okay fine again money i have 1200 let's have coffee in ccd and then let's go home because we have terminated this else so there is no use of this else these two statements would be executed right no matter condition is true or false because these two two statement would be now as a part of program means after the defense block statement right so it will not give error but yeah this output you will get right now let's just do this and see now let's remove the yeast curly braces now we are writing two statement so now by default it will consider only one statement as part of if block if you are not using these curly braces right and these c outlets have coffee in starbucks now it would be a part of after if blog right and after the statement you are using this else so that is not possible here also you will get same error what are then misplaced hence see okay let me just uh save the send on this again see else without a previous if right because after if only one statement is part of if and you have written a statement right so directly else should be directly after if no there would be no other statement between if and else right otherwise else would be a it will give error like else without a pvc right so you can write down this else after this first c out see how many i have after that you can write down this else below that is fine that will work right now let me just put these curly braces here and i am just removing else curly braces it will not give any errors right it will work fine but only one point this first statement see out money i have would be considered as part of else law the second statement let's have coffee in ccd will be a part of after a fails block okay let's just run this if the money is i have 200 only so condition is not true control will go to the else part right so it will print money i have let's have coffee in ccd let's go home okay you are not able to see any difference here let me just run this again and right now i'm putting 1200 means condition is true it should print only money i have 1200 let's have copy in starbucks and let's go home right okay it will print money i have 1200 let's have coffee in starbucks and let's have coffee in ccd then let's go home why these two let's have copying ccd also because now this line is also a part of after effects block you are not putting a semi uh that those curly braces so only one line would be considered as part of else block that is why so starbucks also security also right okay now i guess that's it about this if else block defense statement if you are trying something with this if else and you are not getting why you are getting that kind of output because you also can try different different things with if else law it's not like that whatever the syntax according to that only write defense block do some tricky things with these programs by yourself and find out what kind of output you are getting and why also the reason also so i hope you got the working of if else statement now the one assignment for you is you have to take two variables one is money second is age and you have to put two condition in this if block money if greater than equal to thousand as well as age should be greater than twenty if both the conditions are true money greater than equal to thousand is greater than 20 both the conditions are true in that case only you can have coffee in starbucks right otherwise coffee in ccd so you have to put these two conditions so this is assignment for you guys although i haven't tried starbucks coffee but i'll try someday anyways in the next video we'll see elsie flatter so i'll see in the next video till then bye take
