hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen functions without on value means what is the return statement how to write a return statement with a function how a function is going to return a value but single value right in the previous video we have to take an example in that case the function was returning a single value right now if you want to return multiple values then within the same a single return statement we can return the function can return multiple values as well and there are multiple methods for that like using Tuple we can return using object using list using different different variables so all these methods will be discussing in this video right let's take a simple example we are going to uh you know find out mean mode and median right so let me just take this example so at first let's let's create a new file here multiple return values Dot py right so I am taking a function name I'm taking like mean median underscore mode right or any name you can take and in this case I am passing a list the data in the form of a list so see you can pass a list as well so suppose I am passing like something like this this less time passing and I want to calculate mean median as well as more from this list right so this is our function now we are going to Define this function define Def and same name we are going to take mean median and mode so let's take a variable list one right now here we have a statistics module here rather than just writing then all the formula and all for mean median and more just import that statistic module from Python language and there we have builtin function for main median and mode so I'm going to import this Statistics module because our motto is 2 you know get you familiar with multiple return values rather than finding out how to find out mean median and more rather than the formulas right so we are not going to write down any formula we will just and simple in simple return statement what simply we will write return module name first statistics dot the function name see as you can see we have mode mean and median right so let's call Main first and pass the data data in is in list one now comma then same statistics Dot next is median and just pass list one then again comma statistics Dot mode and same list one right see in a single return statement we are returning three values we are writing these so this mean median mode are builtin functions okay now while returning now whatever the mean median and more three values this this function will return to the caller caller is this function mean median mode the function name is mean median mode or you can take any function name right and we are passing a list here so if if you simply print here then this this data will be assigned to a tuple here three values would be returned to the caller and that would be assigned in a tuple right in the form of Tuple we can fetch multiple values multiple return values okay let's run this C this is mean this is median this is mode and see as you can see in the form of Tuple we are getting multiple values so one way is this in the form of list also we can fetch multiple values so here you just have to change return and list the data we are writing in square brackets so just square bracket here now if you print this then let's run this see now if you are getting this multiple values in the form of a list or see rather than just printing if suppose if you think that I will take only one variable result is equal to this so is it possible that only one variable we can fetch all the three values yes it is possible because here in return We Are writing these square brackets so in the form of list it it will return okay now it is not printing anything because we are not printing this result let's run this C in the form of list we are getting three values all right one more method is what rather than one variable we can take three variables here like maybe I am taking a comma B comma c three variables so first is first it will return mean okay and rather than list let's just take simple nothing we are putting no no square brackets or nothing else so first it will return mean so mean would be assigned to a then median would be assigned to variable B and mode would be assigned to variable C so here what we can print like suppose using F string I am printing first is like mean is and mean is in variable a then median is using formatted string we can crash to the values so mean is a b and c okay let's run this c mean is this median is 3 mode is 3. and if you want to print this in different different line then you can write down here you can put a slash in here right slash n and here also slashing see okay so like this within a single return statement the function can return multiple values it's not like that a single statement can return only one value okay now one point the return statement is like its end of execution of this ah function so after this return if you write any statement suppose after this return I want to print end of function so what do you think this line would be printed or not let's run this C only mean median and mode this line would not be printed because once the control will encounter this return statement means end of the function whatever you will write after this return within the function those statements would be ignored and not to be executed okay now one more thing within a single function we can use multiple return statement here we are writing only one return statement but we can use multiple return statement as well okay let's take one more example suppose uh same I am taking that example that name first name and last name formatted name or you can take simple addition also that example So Def and we are defining a function add and here two arguments right so I want to ask from the user enter two variables A and B if user enter both the variables 0 then I want to return none because 0 means no sum this is an example so with the help of if else we can use multiple return statement one way is this so if I am putting a condition a is equal to is equal to 0 and b equal to equal to 0 both are 0 then simply return nothing else return a plus b okay now let's first of all ask from the user so in variable one using input function we will ask from the user so with input function whatever we will enter that would be string so first convert that into type cast into int here only now just call the function add and pass variable 1 comma variable 2. and whatever it will return suppose I am storing that into result and we are just printing result let's run this see enter first variable I'm entering 0 second is again 0. see now return it is returning none because if both variables are 0 and 0 means it will enter into this if block and here I am writing only return no return value it means it will return none or if you want to print here something that also fine like uh some message also if you want to print you can write down here so let's run the C again and first variable 0 0. now you have entered 0 for both variables right so one return statement and second return statement let's run this again and if I enter one is one variable is 16 and another variable is suppose 0. now it will return the sum 16. because if both variables are 0 then only it will enter here because we are putting a condition logical and and means to enter here both the condition should be true but here only 1 is 0 other is 16 so it will run 16 plus 0 16. so this is one more simple example just to get you familiar with like we can use multiple return statements as well within a single function and using a single return statement we can return multiple values these two are different different concepts so I hope you got this thing is also possible and how to use this thing right now one exercise for you is in the previous video we have seen one example that formatting your name just to convert your first name and last name in title Haze right so there you have to put a condition in defining that function if the both the name first name and last name is none you are providing an empty string right nothing you are providing for first name and second name then it should return nothing or it should print some message like please enter valid input or if you are entering first name and last name like Jenny last name is khatri then it will return the expected output like Jennifer in title case so this is for your exercise you can write down this thing the logic in the comment section right now that's it for this video and I will see the next video till then bye take care
