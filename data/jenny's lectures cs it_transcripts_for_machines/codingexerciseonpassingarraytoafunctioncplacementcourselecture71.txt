hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing functions in C++ in previous video we have seen how to pass arrays to a function right now based on that we'll see two or three coding exercise in this video okay if you got that you can easily do these exercises so first exercise is you have to find out minimum and maximum element from an array so I hope you know the logic how to find out minimum and maximum element of an array right now there's a Twist you have to use use functions here so Define two functions Min element and Max element or any name you can take right while calling past that array you take right and then you have to find out like Define those functions to find out minimum and maximum element right using function you have to do this thing right so pause the video if you got my problem statement pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this now we'll Define two functions right suppose void one is minan element we'll uh first declare two functions right mean element and there we should tell the compiler that this function is going to accept array as an argument so this one is for array and second is for size as we pass suppose right so intend it if you want to take name of these elements also I mean this is also fine you can take but but I prefer the syntax I'm comfortable with this thing so next is Max element same prototype would be there for this also right and in main let's take now first an array okay sorry let's take five elements we have in this array right and and we are calling this main element function and we are passing ARR right and obviously the size as well so you know the formula to calculate size size of this complete area divided by size of one element or one element is of type int so size of int we can also write and here we are passing size as well right so let's define now this function here you need to take name this is compulsory the variable name the parameter name a and size we are taking right because this is function definition so I hope now you know the logic minimum element and maximum element so let's take let's take the first element is a smallest one in the array let's assume right so we'll take suppose a variable smallest in smallest equal to a of0 let's take let's assume first element is the smallest one and then we compare the first element with all the elements and if you find any smaller element than the first one then just replace that or something like this right okay now four Loop we are going to compare because the smallest element with all the elements right so four loop from 0 to I less than whatever the size of the array size and I ++ so we take if if a of I whatever the element a of I less than the smallest element then the smallest element will be modified now the a of I element would become the smallest element that's it right and after that just print that element or if you want that this function should return that element so we should change I mean we have to change the Prototype so the return type of the function int and Here Also let's take int and after finding this it will return whatever the smallest element got it now if it is returning something so obviously you have to hold that element in a variable name of and variable of type int right so let's let's take here one more element in int smallest element and whatever it will return we will store that in that element in this variable smallest element and simply we print that smallest element that's it okay let's run this and see it's working or not smallest element is okay smallest element is obviously see here you have to call now that function so the function is main element you're not calling that function so that is why it is giving you whatever the size is right here you if you know the concept of this coma uh operator then you will get this thing why you are getting five right now Min element and okay now we are calling this let's run this and see 78 yeah that's correct minimum element is this so now it's your assignment now pause the video and try that maximum element how to find out right same we consider the first element as maximum element from this array and then we compare this with every element right less than size and I ++ and if uh that those that a of I is greater than now greater than the maximum element if any a ofi I mean the element is maximum the sorry greater than those maximum element then we replace that so now maximum element will become is equal is equal to whatever that AI element right and at last we simply return so let's change this prototype this return type to in and here we'll call this this so simply Direct in see out we can call uh whatever the function name x x element and pass a and the size let's run this and see what outut we getting minimum element is 78 maximum in is 56 yeah that's correct right so here we are passing an array in a function and we are you know performing some operations right okay these two I hope you are done with these two one more exercise is suppose uh you are hosting an event in your school or in your college and you want to invite some guest speakers right so for that you will make that list right and you'll print that list and after that after hosting that suppose after hosting that or after that event you just clear that list so print the list and clear list two function you need to Define okay so suppose we have string an array I mean array of string type and there we have three names maybe like Jenny and Rahul and prep or any other name right so first print that list Define a function print list right and then clear that list after clearing again print that list I hope you got my point we didn't try this out let's declare a function print list and here we will take an array of type string as well as size so that would be an INT another one is clear that list I me clear list and same we'll pass string and array and second size of what data type you need to give no need to give here variable name because it is function declaration now in main function let's take string and like speak speakers list is equal to Jenny it's shuk Khan not the other one and suppose Modi you can make your own list if you don't like these three person you can just change the name right so this is my list fine now okay this is an array obviously so you should declare it something like this right now we are calling that print list and here I'm just passing speaker list and size so let's take let's take here one more variable like end speaker list size is three right and here I'm just passing speaker list size right so now let's let's define this print list so here we have string and let's take name here same name you can take speaker list or S list I'm taking here and then I'm taking simple name in size right okay now the for loop I should be less than whatever the size is and i++ so we will simply print now because this function is not returning anything we just want to print C out and the list so s list and I with some space right let's write down here a new line just to format it a little bit endl right now this is what print list so let me run this and show you the output you will get okay let's run this here don't so this is the list J srk Modi we just printing the list and you also want to uh restrict anyone from this function print list to modify the list so what you will do just write down here const just make this constant so that and no one can modify it right so if you want to here modify so suppose if you want to modify like if you don't like Modi and you want to replace this with Rahul so let's do this but now we have done this constant parameter here so it will give error now if you want to clear the list then let's define this the same function so here let's obviously you have to take the name I'm taking s list and here size so same for Loop and here rather than see out because you want to clear everything out so sore list and whatever the element there just a space or nothing sorry that's it after clearing the list let's call this function clear list here and after clearing again print right and let's uh in this function let's print after clearing let's print list cleared right so this is a program now let's run this and see first the list then list cleared and nothing will be printed now after that right so because list is cleared now you got it so like rather than in we can pass string array also so this is that example I hope you got this how to pass arrays to a function now try out different different exercises and examples on this thing on this topic don't leave this like yeah you got you you what those three exercises and that's it no just try out at least five or 10 exercises of different different type right like have to pass AR to a function so now that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
