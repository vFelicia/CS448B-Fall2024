in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing the programs of printing pattern in c right now in this video we will talk about how to write a program to print this pattern this is what half pyramid of numbers we have discussed a program to print half pyramid of star and inverted half parameter of start please check of those videos first then come to this video right i'll put the disc that link of those videos that playlist name printing pattern and see that playlist link in the description box of this video you can go and check out right now see first of all we'll discuss the logic on this board and then what we used to do i'll show you the output on that ide on bs code right now see here obviously two loops will require one is to print lines number of lines or number of rows and second loop is for number of columns or the actual values we are printing in the columns that thing right so outer for loop is for number of lines how many lines six lines are there so after four loop should run six times right so i'm going to just i'm just going to write the logic here simple not the complete program the complete program i'll show you on my editor on my laptop right we'll run this properly so that it should run up to six i less than equal to six because i want one two three four five six lines right and i plus plus this is what outer loop now actual printing would be done in inner loop now here what you will write see this is what suppose i value is 1 means i value is 2 second line then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6 when i value 6 the sixth line will be printed now i value is 7 no line would be printed that means loop should be ended right now actual printing would be done in inner loop j loop so now when i value is 1 j should be repeated only one time and what it should print the value one not star j would repeat only one time right when i value is two j should repeat one and two two times two columns in this row two columns i want to print and column would be taken care by this j variable so j should run two times but not star it would print some value now i value three j should run 3 times when i value is 4 j should run 4 times 5 times and 6 times right now j value is what it's not that fixed j is what it's changing at first time only one time j should run in first line second time it should run two times and then like this right now j would be what i'm going to start j with one right and how many times j should run j should be less than equal to we cannot write down any fixed value here because j value is changing right but when i 1 j would be repeating one time and i is two they should be repeated two times when i is three they should be repeated three times i hope you are going to able to relate this thing right so now j should be less than equal to what i that's it and what j plus plus and within this what you will print now we are going to print star we are going to print value value of what value of j right see percentage d and i am going to print whatever value of j that should be printed right as you can see because one time it should be printed value should be that is one it would repeat two times so first time value would be 1 then 2 it should repeat 3 times then 1 2 3 so that is why i am printing j here right now in outer loop what simply slash n because what how many slash and we require 6 lesson and that's it now please run this program i value is at starting 1 1 is less than equal to 6 condition tree we are going to enter here j value is 1 1 is less than equal to i i value is also 1 condition true 1 is equal to 1 right so we are going to enter here now what it will print value of j value of j is what 1 so 1 would be printed now j plus plus j becomes 2 is 2 less than equal to i 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is not true so we are going to exit from the center loop and slash n so control will go cursor will go in the next line now i plus plus i becomes 2 2 is less than or equal to 6 we are going to enter here now j is again initialized with one j is equal to one is one less than equal to i i value is to yes condition tree we are going to again enter here now j value would be printed j value is one one would be printed here now j plus plus j becomes 2 condition true 2 is less than equal to 2 yes condition true we are again going to enter here j value print j value is what 2 so now 2 would be printed i hope you are getting my point now j plus plus j is 3 but now condition is not true 3 is not less than equal to i i is 2 right so out from the slope slash n now cursor would go into next line now i plus plus i becomes 3 condition is still true again enter here j value would be again initialized with 1 right now i hope you can brighten this program now one two three would be printed here and like this five and one two three four five six would be printed now at one time j i value now becomes after that 4 then 5 then 6 once i when you become 7 7 is not less than equal to 6 we are going to exit from the loop that is the output now see this is what hard coding we are going to run this up to six times now suppose one when when user run at one time i want to print this pattern now when user enter user and second time the program now i want to print up to 10 10 lines next time i want to print 15 lines so that should not be a case that should not be a hard coding i want what at the run time it should ask from the user enter number of rows you want to print right so for what you can do you can simply take like here i am taking two variable i and j one more variable i can take number of rows right and at runtime you can ask from the user like printf enter number of rows you want to print and how you will take the input using scanf at runtime percentage d address of in which variable i want to store the value rules right now when you run this it will ask and the number of rows you want to print and number of rows suppose you are entering number of rows 10 so now up to 10 lines should be printed so we cannot write down here less than equal to 6 10 line means less than equal to 10 more obviously but next time it should be 15 so we cannot write down here 10 or 15 that constant what you can write down the variable in which you are taking the value i less than equal to rows that's it and i plus plus n that is it now when you will run this you can print 10 lines 15 lines 20 lines up to you right so now i'll show you this the the output of this program on my laptop now so now let me create a new file here let me name this pattern three dot c right and right now void main and now i'm going to take two variable for two loops so i'm going to use what two loops right i is equal to one i less than equal to 5 and i plus plus right and sorry it's i plus plus not just plus plus fine now in this one more for loop that is j j is equal to 1 semicolon j less than equal to i right and j plus plus now within this inner for loop what we are going to do we are going to print what not start now we are going to print what some number that is value of j so percentage d j is integer and j right and in outer for loop what will print slash n right and that's it now let me run this program it is going to take some time now see uh yeah it's running see the output one one two one two three one two three four one two three five right now if you don't want you know this hard coding like i less than equal to five now next time when i want to run i want to print till ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten lines or fifteen line twenty line so i want that user should enter number of lines number of rows so what you can do we can take another variable suppose any variable abc name can be anything i am taking rows and i can ask the value from the user at runtime right and how we used to take input using scanner function percentage d and here we are going to pass what address of the name of the variable is rose right and what i think that's it now here i don't want to say it's 5 i want to run this loop till rows i should be less than equal to rows right that's it now let me run this program for you and first of all it will ask for enter number of rows or enter number of lines you want in your program right you want to print right so yeah it's taking some time now see enter number of rows now let me enter suppose 10 rows and see the output it is printing up to 10. now again if you want to run and you want suppose 7 rows or 15 rows 20 rows then easily you can enter because i this time we are taking input at runtime right now it will ask any number of rows see enter number of rows and i am suppose uh entering 10 sorry 15 rows so that is what up to 15 it is going to print right so i hope you got it now next is i think you can print that inverted uh that pyramid now i hope you got the program how to print this type of pattern now for you one assignment is you have to print inverted that half pyramid of these number like this you have to print now these are two assignment for you you have to print first of all this pattern right this is inverted half parameter of number and second one is this one a little bit i have changed i think if you have got how to print this pattern very carefully then you have to change the logic a little bit please think over it and you have to print these thing this is assignment for you and you can send me you can either you can copy paste your code in the comment box or you can send me the message on my instagram account right so now in the next video we are going to discuss you know some more printing pattern programs some complicated ones so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
