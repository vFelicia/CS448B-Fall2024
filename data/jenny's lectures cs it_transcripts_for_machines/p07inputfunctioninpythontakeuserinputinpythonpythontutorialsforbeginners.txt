so in the series of learning python programming language we have discussed one basic function in python that is print means how to print something on console for that we use which function print function okay now next thing is input function in python now if you want to take input from user then which function we will use see in c programming we use scanner function for print print a function to print something on the screen and scan up to take input from user in c plus we use c out to print something on the screen c into take input from the users so save in python we use if you want to take input from user which function we use input function so this thing will discuss in this video everything about input function how to use this with the help of a program and all the basic working of this function also okay so now basic syntax first of all the syntax of using this function is simply we write input this and although no obviously it is a function i have told you so this parenthesis now in this parenthesis generally the syntax we write is it is written like here we we have written a word prompt now what is this prompt see if i want to ask uh your name with the program like whenever you run i run a program or any command in python it should ask what is your name this is my output screen and it should print here what is your name and then you will enter like i am entering jenny okay it will take input from the user or maybe you will enter your name anybody can enter his or her name so this what is your name this would be on the screen this user can see so this is what a prompt prompt is not it's a message or you can say string which will be displayed on the screen before taking input from the user and prompt is optional one point to note here is this prompt is optional if you don't write anything here then also it will run if i simply write input in this then also this function would also run but in this case this would not be shown anything nothing would not would be shown on the screen simply a cursor would be there maybe a blinking cursor or this kind of cursor there user can input his or her name or whatever data or the input he or she wants to give so this prompt is optional okay it's nothing but any string or a message that should be displayed on the screen before taking input from the user fine and by default by default this input function would return a string whatever you will enter that could be considered as a string if i enter jenny that is a string if i enter my name one two three that would also be considered as a string so by default this will return a string okay now how to use this how to use this c we simply write input and whatever message you want to print or the prompt like what is your name this i want to print so if you run this on the output screen what is your name you will see this thing and then you can enter your name okay this is simple working or you can say this uh syntax of this input function so if i enter here jenny and simply press enter then the program is going to exit and the behind the scene process is what whatever name you will enter here that in the program we have written this line so this line would be replaced by this string or this message or you can say this name not actually it's not like that you will see in the program this line would be replaced by jenny no no no it's behind the scene process the working behind the scene what is happening whenever you will enter any name click enter so this name would be rather than this line here it would be jenny virtually try to see rather than this line in your program we have jenny okay so let's run a program we will print we'll simply ask from the user what is your name jenny and then after that it will print hello jenny this kind of program we will make so let's see so let's create a new file right click on this project then new file and input underscore function dot p y okay now we'll simply use input c input below this you can see here we have prompt so let's write down what is your name that's it and let's run this right click on this you can do this thing and run input function this name what is your name see here program is still running okay now you have to enter your name here if i click here then cursor is this you can see the blinking cursor so i'm entering here jenny and now i'll click enter enter now you can see process finished now program this and you can say we have exited from this thing fine in print see print hello world if you run this right click on this run first and hello world just i have run this and you will say this output hello world and process finished okay but in this input function when you run this you will not see this line process finished with exit code whenever you enter then you know your name or any string and then you press enter then program will terminate okay so now it is you can say let's run this and i'll show you let's run this see what is your name it is still waiting to take input from the user process finished you cannot see you are not seeing that line here okay now if i enter here one two three that is also this one two three also be considered as a string by default this would consider it as a string so now see if i run this again what is your name and jenny and click enter so now but what is behind the scene process this jenny so this line input what is your name this line has been replaced by jenny virtually not actually you cannot see this thing but behind the scene it is happening here so let's do ctrl j so see if i want to print hello jenny on the screen then simply i can print like print hello then for concatenation i'm using plus plus and this was the method we have discussed in previous video if i run this it will print on the screen hello jenny see hello jenny see before this line i have put this hash so hash is what in python this is what hash means uh if you want to write down some comment then just before that line you just put hash like in c and c plus plus we have this uh this thing this this slash two slash for comment means that line would not be executed by this interpreter now so i have put this hash means this line is now it's like you can say no more for this program it's a comment okay now rather than jenny if i put this complete thing i'm not putting jenny here i'm putting input what is your name okay first of all it will ask from the user what is your name then i'll enter jenny let's run this and i'll show you what output you will get let's run this it is asking what is your name now i'm entering jenny just click enter and it will show hello jenny okay so once you will enter jenny and click enter then that this this this thing would be replaced by jenny virtually behind the scene and this this jenny and hello that would be concatenated with plus sign so that we have discussed in the previous video so it will show you the output halogen concatenation we have done only this plus symbol but more ways are there to concatenate strings and all so uh we'll see one by one these thing also in later videos okay so i hope now in this for this video that is it i hope you got how to use input function we have nested see we have nested here this input function within print function so now how it would run first of all it will see the print function okay then hello okay string here then they have to add concatenate this plus then concatenate this thing but this is wrote again a function so first this function will be executed then jenny will enter any name then that this line would be replaced by that name and then finally print function would concatenate this thing using plus then it will show output okay i hope you got this so i will give you one coding exercise also for this input function so i hope you got what is input function and how to use it now an assignment for you is you have to print this thing first of all it should ask you it should ask from the user what is your name then user will enter with a face here it should be a space fine then user will enter his or her name whatever name then you should print hey the name like jenny coma how are you it should print this thing i hope you can do this it's very easy so let's pause the video and do this exercise okay okay now how to print this thing see we'll sim for taking input we will use input what is your name until now we have learned only one thing like with plus symbol we can concatenate strings okay so this will give this jenny so now hey you have to concatenate this hey then this coma then how are you so how to concatenate this thing and print using print we can print so simply we can concatenate a string here like before jenny we have space then plus then we have a string hey and using print we have to print k then plus this plus this now plus again this comma then plus you can write down this string how are you this is one way so i see as you can see with plus symbol it is actually very not tough or you can say difficult to concatenate these strings and to take care where to put this comma then space and all so there are many more ways also to concatenate these strings rather than you know keeping in mind this thing this you have to put this plus here then space and then this okay so those ways also we'll discuss when we uh you know discuss strings more about strings so for now this is the way rather than this extra space or separate space you can put a space here or you can put this comma here also before this how are you fine now what is your name this should print something like this uh question mark and then put a space here add a space and then closing braces so it will add a space here okay so i hope you got this how to print this thing so now that's it for today now in the next video we'll see what are variables in python so now i'll see in the next video till then bye bye thank you
