hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in this video I am going to discuss about one of the best and free way to start your programming journey by learning Java yes now you can start a programming journey and take your preparation from basic to advanced level by enrolling in guided path of java by code Studio and master the topics like variables operators control statements arrays strings oops Concepts in Java and many more topics now you must be thinking why why you should enroll in this career path what you will get the very first thing is this guided path covers basic to advanced level topics in a structured way plus you will get detailed notes followed by some practice questions as well as for all the topics covered and this carried path cover all the important topics like introductory topics like variables control statements operators plus some Advanced topics like arrays strings oops Concepts in Java collection in Java methods in Java and like this many more topics like this right plus average time to finish this guide path is 25 days not only this you can unlock your free certificate once you complete 80 percent of this guided path after that without penalty you can unlock your certificate right now let's let me just show you how you can you know follow this guided path how you can log in how you can you can say access this guided path the

ODP and you will be logged in right first of all but you have to login right now after that there would be something like a tab guided path and there you will get all the guided paths so here one is basics of java you just click on start learning right now this type of page would be opened right you will you will be redirected to this thing now let me just show you first of all the number of modules here you will get 12 modules now what they are going to cover in each module the very first thing is Introduction to Java notes plus problems you will get now let me just show you first let me just click on that introduction so introduction and edition of java right these nodes you will get now features and use of java then what is jdk JRE jvm these things you will get Basics right after that practice problems also see like this GRE full form you just you know select your answer submit and click next right so have to run a code in Java then you will get some mcqs as well as right like Java file extension you can just transfer a question and submit so this is module one now in second module after this introduction to Java then variables and data types keywords what are variables What are keywords data types types of variables scope of variables typecasting overflow underflow in Java these things same let me just click on anything like keyword in Java you will get nodes here after that practice problems these are practice problems right then data types and then practice problems like this in every module you will get nodes Plus questions right after that after the notes now practice problems also you will get now the third module is basic input output in Java like how you can how a user can input how you can take input from user in Java right then mcqs plus practice problems programs like this practice problems find area of rectangle print name and a swap two numbers calculate simple interest four problems are there so you can click on one problem and see here will be the problem statement first understand this thing detailed explanation what input you can give what output they expect these things first of all read this thing then you can write down your code here so just select your language you are learning Javas you can select Java here and then you can write down your code and you can submit right so practice problems will be given here now in the next module is what operators in Java all the types of operators are automatic assignment relational logical bitwise all the type of operators plus mcqs then control statements in Java selection statements then practice problems as well as the nutrition statement jump statement and then practice problems right methods in Java what are different type of methods parameters method overloading and practice problems just click on any one and see types of methods in Java predefined user defined with code they have explained everything then you will get question like valid function and output which method some mcqs are there right and after that at the end of this module practice problems are always there function to print hello world print all the divisors over number set bits total Prime right like this in every module this is the pattern then memory allocation right garbage collection then arrays 2D arrays advantages and drawbacks of arrays practice problems then strings right then oops Concepts in Java Right Packages class Constructor encapsulation inheritance polymorphism everything exceptional handling introduction to exceptional handling types of exception Java multiple catch globe in Java right finally a block in Java and everything you will get here then mcqs then finally collections in Java why we use Java collection introduction then mcqs then problems and collection algorithm let's say example problems these are example problems like what is the output of the following program right and here they have given answer also plus explanation so this is I think a plus point for you guys question plus answer plus explanation also they have given right so these are 12 modules and one thing after completing 80 percent of this syllabus you can unlock this certificate right free certificate you will get here right average 25 days time it will take right and what are the requisite nothing but basic aptitude and you should be you know eager to learn Java language right so I think the plus Point here is what you will get here nodes everything first of all you will get in a structured way plus nodes plus mcqs plus practice problems at one like you can say Under One Roof so this is I guess a very good thing for a beginner specially right so now all the relevant links and details you will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out and if you find out this kind of video helpful for you guys let me know in the comment section so now it's in the next video till then bye take
