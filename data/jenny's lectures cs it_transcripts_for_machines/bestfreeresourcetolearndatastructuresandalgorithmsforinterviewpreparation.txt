hey everyone so in this video I am going to discuss about one of the best and free resource to start your interview preparation journey by learning data structure and algorithms now you can start your interview preparation by working on this amazing free resource on data structure and algorithms guided python code Studio see when you start preparing for interview interviews it's very important that you can find all the DSA resources at one place and in a structured way right like Theory plus as well as some practice problems so you assert and at this amazing free guided path of data structure and algorithms now before moving to this like how you can follow this kind of path let me just tell you what are the prerequisite for this at the data section and algorithm guided path prerequisite is what it's nothing much but you should have basic knowledge of programming right then you can easily follow this guided path right now why you should go for this guided path only see first this carried path covers all the topics like from basic to advanced level data structure topics in a structured way with notes detailed explanation plus some practice problems for all the topics covered right and in this credit part they will cover all the important topics of data structure and algorithms like complexity analysis time complexity space complexity right arrays strings multidimensional arrays trees Stacks queues Ling list try data structure bit manipulation dynamic programming backtracking and binary search linked list so all the important topics will be covered here and average time to finish this carried path is what 120 days not only this you can unlock the free certificate once you complete 80 of this guided path right now let me just show you how you can follow this guided path so the first step is you need to first of all log in on code Studio the link I'll put in the description box of this video right don't worry now then you will click on the tab this guided path and you will see here guided paths like data structure and algorithm under this tab for beginners these are guided paths for intermediate you will find one data structure and algorithm this right and then you can click on start learning right now let me just show you the modules what this carried path will cover right first see the com module one is complexity analysis this one so let me just click on this first you will get complete nodes see as you can see the complete nodes about time complexity right and then about space complexity then mcqs these are some mcqs the questions right you can just answer this question quick submit end next right like this this is the pattern for every module first query nodes plus then some mcqs plus practice questions then second module is arrays algorithms this is very important that's in the national flag algorithms searching and sorting prefix some suffix some mixed problems so see let me just click on one more thing once you click on this here see this is the problem statement read this problem statement then input what should be the input what should be the output everything and then you can write down your code here you can just select your language like Java or python or C plus plus in which you are comfortable you can select that language and write down the code and you can just submit it right like this and third module is string same introduction to Strings and then some problems then basic algorithms two pointer technique sliding window technique multidimensional arrays first of all Theory then some problems mcqs right recursion and backtracking like this popular here let me just click on this tab this popular problems so Sudoku reach the destination path in a Mage and end Queen puzzle so you can click on here you can see the detailed statement here first of all read this what is the problem statement then you can write down your code here and you can submit right so first read the notes the query and then go to the problems and solve them right then sorting all the Sorting algorithms C nodes for every sorting algorithm selection bubble insertion see you will get here notes first with proper examples right right and then problem based on sorting like these are some problems you can solve here same pattern you will get in every module so they'll cover all the important topics of data structure and algorithm binary search right linked list link list reversal sorting and stacks and queues then right then trees tree traversal standard problems on trees and all then binary search trees right and then priority queues and heaps first of all notes then implementation and conversion based problems and K based problems application based problems and see these problems are being asked in these companies like Amazon Samsung Microsoft these problems you will get here so that would be very you know beneficial for you guys because Under One Roof you are getting everything notes plus problems plus mcqs so it's very good I guess DP problems dynamic problem programming problems then price with manipulation right then greedy algorithms then some miscellaneous topics like hash map circular views dqs doubly link list circular Ling list and string algorithms right and if you have more doubts you can go to these FAQ section also right and this this after completing 80 percent of this guided path you can unlock the free certificate right here see you can without penalty you can unlock this free certificate right and this is absolutely free so all the relevant links and details I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
