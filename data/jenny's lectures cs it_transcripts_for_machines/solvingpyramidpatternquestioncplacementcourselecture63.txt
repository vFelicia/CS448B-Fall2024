hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing strings in C++ in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise based on strings that is we have created our substitution Cipher right I hope you have done that exercise in this video so we will see one uh question that is we're going to create a pattern and which is a pyramid pattern right so what you have to do you have to write a program that will create a letter pyramid pattern from a user given string means user will provide a string and using that string the characters of that string you will create a pyramid like this if a user has given this a b c this string right then the pattern would be something like this a then a b a then a b c b a right if user has given 1 2 3 4 in string format as a string so the output should be something like this if user has given this A B C D E then output should be something like this right so you have to do this thing now you know we have done uh strings you know how to use Loops you know how to use like nested Loops as well right so these things you have to do only nested Loops or maybe not nested Loop you can use some Loops also or you have to use strings and there are multiple ways to solve this problem this kind of problem right we'll see one way right in this video right so what you have to do just pause the video and try this out let me just give you a hint first C first of all in these pattern printing uh program you have to decide like number of rows and number of columns right so from these example number of rows are how many number of rows are there if you see closely then you have given three characters like in a string which is having three character or the length of the string is three so there are three rows only here the string is having four character means length is four so four rows Here length is five so here we have five rows so this is final number of rows are equal to length of the string right so you have to find out yeah length of the string you have length function size function based on that you can find out length right then before actual printing there are some space like here we have 1 2 3 4 here we have 1 2 3 here we have 1 2 here we have one space so this triangle first you have to print here also same like space we have one and two one so this triangle this space triangle first you have to print right then this thing this triangle right and then this this one so three or four thing you have to do here right how many spaces are there spaces are number of see number of rows 1 2 3 uh sorry 1 2 3 4 5 or if you uh take the index I mean index is 0 1 2 3 4 so here space are four here spaces are three here we have two here we have one here we have zero right length is five so maybe spaces are five minus whatever the index + one index of first row is 0 so 5 0 + 1 here we have four so here we have four spaces this formula we can take this kind of logic we can take to print spaces right so first four then three then two then one then zero then we can print this thing right so let's take like this character first in first line we will print a then for next character B before printing B here in the center before B we will print whatever is there whatever the characters are there before B and after B we will print whatever the character before B in reverse order suppose here we have like like here we have C so C would be printed here in the 1 23d row having index two in center but before printing this C we will print whatever is there before the C AB so AB first space then ab and then print the character actual character in the string then after this character we will print whatever the characters are there before this C in reverse order ba like this so I hope you got this is not so much tough yeah it's little bit tricky but not so much Stu so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this let's now create a string variable letters and from user we'll take input let's take this using let's take the input using get line function okay now we have taken input till now right so now we will take a function sorry a variable length and there let's just find out the length of the string length or size any function you can use right let's take one more position one more uh variable position and position is at first zero right so now let's use that range based for Loop for each character from the string let letters we are going to repeat the process right first space that space triangle will print space okay now first okay uh let's count how many spaces you have to print space is equal to whatever the length of that string minus whatever the position you have but here not length minus position because if at first length is three and position is 0 so 3 0 means three so at first three space would be printed in first line three then two then one because but actually we want at first only two space then one space then in last line no space if the input is ABC right this is also fine if you want to print one space in last line that is also fine but I don't want to print any space so let's do position + one so at first length is 3 3 minus position is 0 + 1 1 so 3 1 is 2 so two space would be printed then one space then zero space right now that while loop while the SPAC is greater than zero till then we will just print space and then we'll do minus minus spaces so this is for to print the space after printing spaces now before printing the actual character the current character before that character whatever the letters in that string those letter we will print in order right so for Loop same from zero till till the actual position till the current uh character we will print whatever is there in in that particular order so for in I is equal to 0 and I less than position not less than equal to less than position because at position we have current character but right now this Loop is to print before the current character whatever the characters those will print only so it is less than position right I ++ sorry now we will just print from these letters this string letters do add I we'll just print this thing right and after printing this you will print the current character whatever is there in this C because at first if there is if the input is ABC then at first first in C we have a right so in C now we have a so a would be printed see at first position is zero so length is three so here spaces are two so only this while Lo would be executed two times so two space would be printed and after that see this Loop is at first I is zero a variable we have I that is zero and I less than position position is 0 so 0 less than 0 no so this Loop would not be executed simply after that this line will be executed means we'll print a directly right because right now in C we have a right now next for Loop is to print the remaining character in reverse order because the pattern is something like this see if the pattern if the given input is a b c d then a then a b then a a b c then b a so if the current character is like C if right now the position is 0 1 to 2 and the current character is C so after printing the C whatever the remaining character before the scene that string that would be printed in Reverse holder right ba a CBA here we have only okay before B we have only one character a so this a would be printed right but a in first line only a would be printed right so in first line only a would be printed the next Loop is also Al having no significance for first line because the next Loop is to print whatever the remaining character in a reverse order right like b a CB a like this so for we'll take one variable I equal to Z and other variable also you can take i j k anything sorry I equal to the position whatever the position minus one why so because position means at position we have the current character right so if the current character is C we have printed a in next first line then a b a next line and now we have current character C right here C has been assigned with this range based for loop from letters to in this variable C right so the current character is C so after printing C after that we'll print b a so the position is is C current character the position is C that is why we are initializing this position minus one because we are we are going to print after C ba a so before the C so position minus one and then this should be I greater than equal to 0 till zero we are moving in backward Direction now right because in reverse order you have to print and IUS minus so same just excess from that string that is letters do at and I simple but this time it will print reverse order because this Loop is in reverse order and this Loop is in forward Direction so it will print in forward Direction like a b c but the slope print like C B A like this so remaining character we have printed in reverse order after that new line we will move to the new line so for new line we have andle or you can just write down here slashing right after that we will do position Plus+ right and that's it okay here we have two semicolon let's run this and I'll show you the output first we have a b c d so see this is the pattern right if I run this again and and this time I'm going to give 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is the pattern right first Loop is to print this space only second Loop is to print whatever the current character before that whatever the character in that string those it will print like 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 right and after that after the current character we will print the remaining character in reverse order so the third Loop is for that right suppose I give uh this kind of thing journy so see it will print something like this whatever string you will give it will print a you know pyramid according to that string right so I hope you got this but if you're not getting this you can just pause the video you can just write down this thing on a piece of paper and dry in this right if you get this it's okay you can just stop watching this video but if you haven't got this now I'm going to dry run this for you on whiteboard right we'll just write down this complete code on whiteboard and I will dry on this line by line for you guys right so if you are still confused you can just continue watching this video okay now let me dry this for you suppose we have given letters only a b c the string is ABC right so length of the string is right now we have length is three 1 2 3 this will give three so in Len we have in Len as a variable we have three position is also a variable we have taken the value is zero now for each character in this string for first character a for each character we will do this thing right so first we'll take character a so from letters this is range based for loop at first in C now we have a because letters are a b c so first a would be assigned to this C now C is a so we have a variable C character type of and here we have a right now first create spaces count space length minus position + one length is 3 3 minus position is 0 + 1 so spaces are in spaces now we have two right now while space greater than zero just print space at first space value is two condition true so first space would be printed here suppose this space would be printed then minus minus space now space becomes one still condition true one more space would be printed space minus minus now space becomes zero condition two no so we are out of this y Loop and next is this four Loop so two space has been printed now you have to print what is the actual character right at First Position like at zeroth position right okay now the next this Loop is this Loop is see here we are printing the actual character whatever is there in this C so at first we have in C A so a would be printed but before a what here we have like a a b a and a b c b a so before the ual character whatever are there before in that character in that string that we are going to print so this is this Loop is for that you have to display in order up to the current character so current Char character right now is a and before there is nothing so obviously this Loop would print nothing let's see now we have a variable I in I we have zero at first I less than position position is zero is this condition true 0 less than zero because position is zero no so we are out from this Loop now see out C so first a would be printed because in C we right now we have a right now this for Loop is to print whatever are there after this current letter like current letter in reverse order after that we will print whatever is there like suppose current character is C so before c we have AB so we'll print a in reverse order ba so this Loop is for that to print the remaining character in reverse order right so reverse order means suppose current character is C so B A from here we are going to start until zero we will move backward so Loop would be something like minus minus not plus plus so here we have I a variable which is position minus one because actual character is at position so suppose position is C so from position minus one we are going to start printing but at first now position is 0 0 1 is min one is this condition true no so nothing would be printed from this Loop now see out andle so after a andle means we are in new line here and now position Plus+ so position becomes here one right now from a b c now next character B would be assigned to this C so now here we have B the current character is B now right and we are in second line same space would be counted right so length minus now at this time position is one so 1 + 1 is 2 length is 3 3 2 is 1 so space is right now 1 for the second is iteration spaces are one so how many spaces would be printed only one space after that out from the S Loop now we are in this Loop right so here should be this kind of output a b c sorry A B A right so same i0 I less than position position is right now one so 0 less than one yes condition true so we'll enter here and whatever is there at this I from letters we will print I is zero so let us do at zero at zero we have a so first a would be printed right now I ++ now I becomes one so one less than one condition is not true out from this Loop right now current character in C is B current character in C is B so current character would be printed and after this current character whatever the remaining that would be printed in reverse order right so now I is equal to position minus one position is one position is right now one so 1 1 is 0 so I is 0 condition 0 less than so 0 greater than equal to 0 yes condition true so we'll enter here and whatever is there at I that will be printed so I is right now zero so at zero we have a so again a would be printed now iusus I becomes minus one this condition true no so out from this whole Loop andle andle means you are in next line here and position plus plus now position becomes two now two means we are here now so current character is right right now C right and now from letters right again in this character C next C would be assigned C would be assigned so here we have C okay for C also same would be repeated same steps in C see now position is 2 2 + 1 is 3 3 3 is 0 so no space would be printed here we are out from this right now this one position is two so i0 0 for 0 1 two times this Loop would be executed because position is two right so letters at zero letter at one would be printed letter at Zer is a then B would be printed now current letter is in C we have C so C would be printed now in reverse order now I is position minus one position is two 2 1 is 1 so I is right now 1 1 greater than equal to Z yes enter here whatever is there at one from this letter that would be printed so 0 1 2 at one we have B so B would be printed i 0 at zero we have a so a would be printed then minus one this condition is not true out from this Loop Andel means we in next line position plus plus position is three right but now let us after C there is nothing so nothing would be uh initialized into this character C this is range based for Loop right so one two three like three times this Loop would be repeated the iteration but after C there is nothing so nothing would be assigned to C now end of the loop end of the range based for Loop and we are out and this is the pattern that will be printed right if you give input ABC and that's exactly we want right so again you can just write down this on a piece of paper if you're not getting this and dry run this with a different example I hope you got this right now in the next video we'll see uh functions in C from the next video we'll start functions in uh C++ right so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
