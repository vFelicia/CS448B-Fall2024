so in the series of learning python programming language in previous video we have discussed how you know some rules of naming a variable okay now in this video we will see the next topic is data types in python primitive data types in python or you can say builtin data type in python you'll see in this video this topic like what is data type what are different builtin data type in python how to use those those data type and all with the help of programs examples okay now see as an instance just data type means it tells the type of data we can store in a variable this kind of thing but in python it is different from c and c plus plus those languages in python python is an object oriented programming language so everything is like considered as an object so in this case these data types are considered as classes these are classes and the variable you create those are known as instance or objects of these classes didn't get it it's okay let me give an example if you write how to declare a variable we write variable name suppose i am taking variable underscore 1 equal to 3 now we know that this 3 is integer whole number whole number so this variable of type their type of this variable is integer okay so now in this case in this case yeah okay the data type of this integer is this variable is integer but if you check the data type in python we have a function to check the data type of any variable okay how to check we have a function type so if i print something like this print type and within this type i'll be using this variable name where underscore one so this function type it is used to check the type type of a variable whatever variable you want to check those you can write down here okay so the variable i'm writing where one so it will check the type and i want to print that type so that is why i'm writing this function into print so it will print what this kind of output you will get class and kind so yeah it is of integer type but this is what a class so these day type these data like in float string these are classes and now this where one is what object or you can say instance of this class int so this is the case in python actually okay this is actually the data type in python right now see in python actually we don't need to tell like the name of the variable like in c or c plus plus we use in if you have to write then we write in and where underscore one is equal to three you have to tell the data type but here we don't need to tell the the type of the data we simply write down the name of the variable assignment assign a value python itself will figure out the type of this data okay that is a plus point in python okay now see if i write something like this so there are multiple data types in python multiple builtin data types in python basically in this video we will discuss hint float string and boolean there are multiple data types also list range double dictionary set right complex so those are also will be discussing one by one in later videos but these are some basic type we will you know generally mostly will use these kind of data so those these things these four data we will discuss in this video okay now in so into will this is what contain integer like whole number it will contain from positive to negative any number and one more thing there is no range the number there is no limit on the number you can take the number as long as possible although the constraint is your memory of your system if i write something like this if i am taking a variable where is equal to 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 2 it's a long number i am having yeah it is possible to take a long number and you will print the number then you will see this number would be printed okay but see this if you go in more deep let's discuss in more deep actually if the number is without prefix then that would be considered the sequence of decimal would be considered as a decimal number if you write hair prefix what prefix we can write something like this see as we know decimal number or integer can be a binary type octal type hexadecimal type okay so if i write a number something like this if i print something like this print 0 and b see this prefix 0b or 0 capital b this is for binary zero this is zero zero small o zero capital o this prefix is what for octal number octal numbers are actually prefixed with this thing 0x and 0 capital x small x capital x this is what this is a hexadecimal number so if a number is prefixed with these things like i am writing a number 0 b and i'm writing 1 0. 0 b means 0 b or capital b now compiler would interpret that this is binary number means binary 10 binary 10 means in decimal it will print 2. fine if i write something like this print 0 and small or capital o and i'm writing something like this like here i'm writing suppose 10 so 0x prefix means it is octal number so the equivalent number decimal number of this is what i guess 8 decimal number is 8 if you are not sure you can convert like if i have decimal number 8 and i want to convert it into an octal number or base eight so you just have to divide it by eight eight one zero eight zero one once you have zero stop and just write down these digits from here to here 1 0 1 0 yeah the octal of this 8 is what 0 0 1 0 that is 8. if i write something like this print 0 x 1 0 it will print i guess 16. if you write rather than 1 0 if i write something like this 1 2 3 it will print what and if i write 0 x 1 2 3 so you have to try this out this is ocular number this is hexadecimal because it is prefixed with this so what decimal number you will get what decimal number you will get you have to figure it out you have to tell me in comment section so if the number is prefixed with something then that would have some different meaning not that is not a decimal number that is not base 10. fine but if you uh you know find out the type of these numbers also then you will get it is of type int okay it's not like binary or doctor or hexadecimal these are parts or you can say between under this decimal number under the integers but the type would be inked next is float number so float is this basically just decimal number of fraction we are having those are float numbers like i am having 4.2 4.0 0.11 these are floating point number or scientifically you scientifically you can denote with this e notation e or capital e with this thing also we can denote but you don't have to go in this much d just you have an idea with this float number okay strings obviously sequence of characters are strings so this is what string like i'm writing jenny country or any like jenny's lectures csid grf you are the best this kind of thing you can write so this complete is what a string or in single quote also in python we can write down string we can now you know fetch individual character from the string using subscript so i guess this thing will be seen practically i hope now and next is boolean boolean is what true having only two value true and false how to use this so let's just you know do some practical and we'll see on our ide how to use these data types and variables and all okay so let's create a new file i'm taking new file and we are taking the name data type data under data underscore type dot py okay okay now first we'll take a variable suppose i'm taking variable 1 not hyphen it's underscore 1 variable 1 equal to i'm taking a value 3 or any value you can take like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 any long value we can take okay and it will print suppose i am printing print where underscore one so let us run this and see what output you will get here right click on this right click on this space here and just run data underscore type root py this file see it is printing this number so the number you can take any long number you can take there is no limit there is no range in python but the limit is only the constraint is obviously the memory of your system so some operation also like if i do plus here one that also fine this plus will work it will just add it's like addition two integer values are that you will add one to this number okay so if i am taking a number something like this one two three and i'm taking second number where underscore two and that i'm taking like 10 point one okay so the second one is what float and if you want to check if you want to check the the type of these variables then how you can check suppose i am concatenating these two numbers where one underscore where two concatenating you know concatenating means concatenation of strings are possible but here this classes or addition i'm adding adding these two numbers so what would be the output let's run this it's 123 would be added to 10 plus 10.1 so 133.1 if you want to check the type of these so you can simply check the type with this type function type and i am checking the type of where one okay and obviously you will print what is the type so for that we have to use print function again i am printing like print okay type and where to this variable so let's run this and see what output you will get okay this there is a name error c name error one more error we got p print p r i n g t is not defined did you mean print yeah if you have done something like this it is not syntax error it is a name error okay so there are types of error also so let's correct the name it is print and now let's run the c you can see this first the edition then for where one it is of int class class isn't and where two classes float okay so these data types are actually classes in python and these variables are you can say what objects of these classes so let's comment this out and and see if i route with prefix something like this if i want to add this prefix 0 and o and if i print the value where underscore 1 0 means it is octal and where in where 2 i am taking 0 x 1 2 3 and i am printing where 2 so let's see what it will print first output is 83 so 83 if you convert 83 into octal you will get one to three if you convert 291 into hexadecimal you will get 123. so with prefix you got some different answer these are not considered as decimal number but with prefix they have you will get some different result and simply without prefix if you print like where three let's take away another variable one two three and just print where 3 so without prefix obviously it is decimal number so it will print 1 2 3 only and if you check now you check if you check these type of variable 1 and 2 then what you will get into only int obviously with prefix interpretation is this is this is octa this is hexadecimal but these are of int class or int time okay now let's float number we have seen like what a float number let's have strings so i'm having like i'm having a variable name name and there i am having jenny khatri in double go to single quote you can use so if you simply print first let's print type of this thing if you print type then the class is str for string the classes str the real type is str the class is sdf and if you print this name obviously you will print here jenny khatri but you can fetch specific characters with subscript if i write name and in subscript i am writing 0 so what it will print j see it will print j now you will get j because it is sequence of characters so it would be stored as array like ah the index would be started from 0 0 1 2 3 something like this and if i print something like this see if i print zero five so let's pause this and try this out what you will get at five now let's run this and see you will get nothing because at five index there is space if i print here seven then you will get h so you will get h here okay so uh in a subscript also possible like you can access every character of the string and if i am writing here something like this like name and name underscore 1 name underscore 2 one more variable i am taking name underscore 2 and there i am writing jenny khatri and here i am writing cs faculty computer science faculty and i'm just adding ah sorry concatenating name one plus name underscore two so obviously it will look concatenation of these jenny khatri with no no species faculty okay but see if you take a variable variable or i am taking here a a is equal to 1 and if i write something like this name 1 plus a in this case it will give error c it will give type error not syntax error it's type error can only concatenate string note into str because name one is str and a is what integer so we cannot concatenate these things so you have to be very careful why you using these data types because these are you know they have they have having their own properties for some functionality some functions and all so this is not possible but if you name one if in name one or you can say here i am writing name 1 is equal to 1 to 3 still still if i run this you will get an error because 1 2 3 it's not integer you are putting double quote here so it is a string so it is not possible here but 1 2 3 name 1 plus name underscore 2 and suppose in name 2 i am writing c name 2 i am writing one and we are doing name one plus name two so what do you think what do you think what you will get see one two three one it will not do addition these are strings so it will concatenate but rather than this if i write something like this 1 1 2 3 plus 1 now these are obviously integers so you will get one to four and here obviously if you put here also these uh these thing obviously these are string after putting these codes so one two three one you will get here so you have to be you know very careful about using you know when you use these data types what is string what are anything you will write in single quote double quote whether it's a number or characters or anything that could be considered as string okay now let's just comment these out and sorry and this we don't want and in print i am writing what i want to print jenny's lectures like in this way jenny's lectures okay that will print jenny's lectures ah no doubt because we are printing the single quote but out of outer side we are using double quotes so within you can use single quote that is fine okay jenny's lecture it is printing but suppose i want to print jenny's and lectures in double quotes so now both i want to print single quote as well as double quote on the screen so what to put outside we cannot put single quote we cannot put double quote now what is the solution so in this case see the single code these double quotes are having some obviously special meaning to this interpreter this python so if you skip this special meaning then we can do a task so yeah there is a way this special meaning of this single quote and double quote can be skipped in which way you have to use one forward slash sorry backward slash backslash you can say backslash so before this single quote use this backslash before this double quotes also because i want to skip the special meaning of this use this backslash before this use this backslash okay now this is what you can say skip sequence we will discuss these things later in later videos so we are going to escape we are going to skip the special meaning of the these quotes now it will work fine see now let me just run this and it will print jenny's apostrophe the single quotes and lectures in double quotes so we are not getting any error so if you want to skip the meaning of anything any special meaning of these you know symbols and all you just use a backslash that is it okay uh like suppose uh here i wanna i jenny's and after that i have put slash n okay let's just run this so it will show jenny's and lectures in next line so slash n means new line it will add new line yeah slasher is having a special meaning escape sequence escape character is there but i wanna print as it is jenny's slash and lectures i wanna skip this special meaning of slashing how to skip just use before the slash and just use a backslash so nuts let's run this and it will print jenny's slashing lectures i hope you put this uh way also okay skipping of the special meaning of anything and suppose if you want to print this thing ah ten times or five times we can do five into whatever string you want to print five into that and just run this and it would be printed five times that is also possible i guess you can do these things with strings so basic is i guess clear to you about end float string how to use them and bool is also one more thing so if i write like variable is equal to if i write c though you have to take care of this thing t r u e suppose i am writing sorry t r u e true so rather than this i want to print where so what it will print let's run this and see what it will print it is printing through and if i print this type of this type of this variable where let's run this and in the type would be bool so see class bool but if you write small t then it will give error let's run this and see it is a name error it is a name error not syntax error not type error it is a name error because true and false these are a boolean type but capital t capital f you have to take care of this thing but here i am writing small t so it is a name error name true is not defined did you mean true with capital t yeah you mean capital t so here you have to write capital t or you can write false also and i guess true and false will you know we'll be seeing this thing also in later videos many times we will use when we check any condition if you want to check any condition like suppose i am writing uh a is equal to 1 b is equal to 2 and in where i wanna check suppose here i'm writing this where is equal to a less than b that is that also you can do a less than b and now i am printing the square and type of this type of where we bool a less than b means it will be yeah true so c it is true and class the type is bool so in where we have true so this kind of checking of any condition when you want to check condition then we can use this boolean type of variable i hope now that these basics of these you know data types about these data types is clear to you guys so i hope you go to these four built in air types in float strings and flow so now it's in the next video till then bye bye take care
