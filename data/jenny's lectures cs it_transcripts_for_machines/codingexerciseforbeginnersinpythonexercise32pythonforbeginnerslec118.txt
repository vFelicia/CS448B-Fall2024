hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning bth and programming language we are discussing total Graphics right almost we have done all the basics of turtle Graphics right with three or four coding exercises now one more coding exercise we'll see in this video and this would be I think the last video of the this concept Turtle Graphics right okay now what you have to draw let me just show you first so this is the thing we want see I hope you can see now these dots tiny dots Circle type it's not Circle actually but these are dots so having different different colors and randomly the uh turtle is moving in any direction I don't know anywhere and it's just painting something like this like putting the dot to that position randomly anywhere with random colors right so this thing you need to draw for that obv you need to uh refer the python documentation because let me just tell you to draw these dots these dots you can say filled Circle small circle there is a proper method here that is do do right so go to python documentation and check out what is that do method how to use that right what you have to do now the colors have to choose randomly first I hope you have heard uh that H painting about this thing let me just show you there's one artist Damian Hurst and if you search in Google like hurst. painting then you will see many paintings here right so actually there is a proper website rc.net there these paintings are you can you can actually uh buy these paintings so you can just save any image in do jpg and you can extract colors from these pictures that thing we have discussed in previous video you have to extract RGB values from the image using colorr package right so extract these colors and then use these colors for your this project for your this exercise right so this kind of thing we are going to draw like randomly anywhere obviously not exactly something like this but yeah we will try to draw something like this only I see for this painting the price is this one this much US dollar pause the video and now try this out so I hope you have done this so let's create a new file in the turtle project named like doore painting. py we'll Import in this case Turtle class on screen class and let's create a turtle just name of the turtle then name of the class and let's create a screen also a screen object without creating screen object also you can uh you know do this but if you want to check out the screen screen size that also we I'll show you in this video and at last obviously you have to do to hold the screen for do exit on click right now if you want to check out the screen size then we have a method screen size okay you can just print this print screen size and see the screen sizes 400 300 400 by 300 right okay now how to draw the dot see I have told you in Python documentation we have like a this dot method total do dot so you have to give size and the color if you want to give you can just give the color also right Turtle dot dot right just give the size of that do right color also you can give that is also fine but we will not give the color we just give the size so Tom dot dot and just give the size to 20 right now let's run this on the screen you will get one do that is in black color by default right now I want to move the to to any location randomly if you want to move then we have one method go to or set position these kind of thing okay this thing I have shown you in previous videos so you can give to the the x and y coordinate so if I give like 100 100 now let's run this and see after this to creating this do now our turtle is at this location because this location is 0 0 so 100 to xais 100 to Y AIS so here here we have 100 100 so now here also I want to draw a DOT then again I want to move my this Turtle to any other location and there also a DOT then other location then there also a dot but these dots are also colorful so randomly I want to move the turtle at any position I don't want to give any specific x and y coordinate for that also we have something Rand in function from random right okay so rather than giving the specific value what we can do here we just use random door from random module Rand in function and the range let's suppose give 0 to uh 300 or let's suppose we 0 to 100 only right for y coordinate also same thing random do Rand in and same let's give 0 to 100 right and then again Tom dot dot or and any that size of this dot is 20 so see randomly it has chosen this coordinate and again dot but now this these two lines should be go to any specific position and draw the door these two lines should be in a loop right so let's just remove this line just move the circle randomly anywhere and draw the dot or first draw the dot and then move the circle move this Turtle to anywhere right you you can either write down this line first or this line first it's up to you but these two lines should be in in a loop so four let's suppose in a range of uh first let's suppose let's take a small range 100 uh 10 only they should be indented right let's run this see these dots are here right but okay now we are moving here this side only this side only only we not moving the turtle is not moving to uh the the that side let me just show you to this side because this side is minus side and we are only generating plus values 0 to 100 0 to 100 so to this side also I want to move this Turtle so better to give Min 100 let's give 100 100 see you can just test the values any values you can give it's not like that you have to giveus 100 100 50 100 4 300 any values you can given you can you can just check out let's run this now see now in both the sides turtle is moving minus plus side right but now you have to extract colors from the image and you have to use but extraction we have used we have done in previous video right so this is my extraction list I have extracted from jk. jpg many colors right and I'm going to just copy paste this color list so this is the color list I have so randomly from this list I'm going to choose now okay so let's choose the color first Tom dot pen color pen color should be randomly from this list just provide the RGB value So Random dot choice and for from this color list choose any tle any tle RG either this this or this right and then that color would be generated this thing also we have seen the pen color how to use pen color and all okay fine let's run this okay see see now the error is bad color sequence 164 152 53 these are bad color sequence because because I told you you have to set the color mode first so the turtle do color mode and the color mode should be on Turtle it's not on the turtle object it's not on to it's turtle turtle do color mode it should be 255 because if you check if you check the the the this uh pen color if you check this pen color from this documentation see now you can we can give are any set pen color to the RGB color represented by the doule rgbs RGB and this RGB must be in the range of zero to color mode and the color mode can be either one obviously if you take a zero color mode from 0 to zero color will be black so either 1 or 255 generally we take 255 to just take the complete integer value like 0 1 2 3 4 up to 255 if you take color mode one then it would be in decimal or float value decimal value right so that is why it's compulsory to set the color mode first to use these type of color sequence let's run this and see now this time any random color from this here also we have some colors but that are not exactly visible right these are dark colors and these are light colors so obviously we don't want to draw small pain we want a large painting because that would be more expensive so let's repeat it till 100 okay let's run this so this kind of painting you will get but this is in this area only because we have set these XY coordinate to 100 to minus uh + 100 so if you set to 200 to+ 200 or 300 also you can set let's set 300 300 and this also 300 300 right because the size is 400 by 300 screen size and obviously you don't want to draw that lines so first before drawing this thing at first only let's do and before here only let's do pen up just to pen up that's it no need to do pen down here and let's just increase the speed to the turtle speed of the turtle to fastest 10 let's run this see now I hope now you got how to draw that that this type of painting that would be really expensive you can sell your painting also okay now this kind of thing you can play around with this thing and you can just draw your painting it's up to you if if you want your painting to be more dense then range should be let's take 300 and let's run this so these numbering you can do like you can change according to yourself right so like this there are many paintings of like H painting you can just draw one painting exactly if you want to draw right so this is how we can do this thing I hope you got this exercise right the screen size how to set screen size if you want to set this screen size by default it's this 400 by 300 you can set by this thing same same method you you need to use S1 do screen size S1 do screen size and there you can give what screen size you want to set 500 500 you want to set that is also fine you can set you now I have set the screen size to this and again I'm printing the screen size so let's run this C first screen size was 400 300 and now 500 500 right like this you can play around play with this code and you can draw different different paintings right so I hope you got this now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
