hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing some coding exercises using dtal Graphics in python in the previous video we have seen how to generate a random work of the turtle with different different colors randomly chosen colors right according to RGB value now in this video we'll see two more exercises two more shapes we are going to draw right so the first one is let me show you see I hope you have seen this uh star when you go to that python Turtle documentation this page then we have this Turtle Star right so we will draw this star first this Turtle star so as you can see here see the pen color is the boundary is pen color is red but inside the filling color is yellow so two colors you need red pen color and filling color is yellow right now how to draw this thing saying obviously the at first Circle or sorry the turtle would be at the center of our screen like this then it will move something like this then how this star would be drawn and when to stop the circle you have to decide these things mean particularly you can say uh you can take the distance 100 like the edge of this star this something like this this would be 100 right now you have to the side after moving 100 like forward at what angle it is going to move the head right at what angle and then when to stop these two things you have to decide the stopping condition and the angle right so pause the video and try this out it's very simple so I hope you have done this let's try this let's create a new file in that Turtle project turtle star. py and and here same thing we will do like from so same first we are going to import the turtle class as well as we can import let's see screen class if you want and let's create a turtle Tom is equal to Turtle just a turtle name any name you can take it's not like that you have to take Tom only x y z a BC and the name of the class is turtle with capital T and then this brackets so this is a object and to hold the screen we will use let's take first let's create a screen as well in the previous ones we haven't created a separate screen but let's try this out this is also fine with a screen class let's create a screen S1 right and at last you just have to decide I mean to hold the screen so once I click on that particular screen then it will it should disappear so S1 dot we have many method like one is exit on click so S1 dot exit on click right okay that's it now you have to draw the star so let's take the color first Tom dot we have a method we know color and two argument we can give here one also two also this thing we have we discussed when discussing the methods pen color fill color uh begin color end color sorry begin fill end fill in that we have like pen color fill color and as well as color simpol so first argument is pen color that's red second would be considered as fill color that is yellow okay that's fine so Tom do color is this right now you have to move how to draw this this star if my like this is my my screen and here in the center I have my turtle so I'm going to move the turtle to 100 pixels right then let's how to create this one like this then again like this then again like this right I hope you are getting okay my drawing is not so good so but but you are I hope you are able to get how to dra this thing like this so you have to decide the angle and when to stop that thing also you have to decide like this right and it is going to continue till the stopping exit condition met uh stopping condition so see if we move first like this and then we are moving like this so this is the angle this is the angle this this angle is what if you move something like this that that is 90° but it's not 90 in between it's again 90 + 45 but that is 135 but more than 135 so let's take it to you can say around 170 right you can take different different angles according to that you can just draw the shape and then you will get the exact idea the angle is what fine so first let's move this Turtle forward to 100 pixels then just move this Turtle to left left Tom dot left let's take 170 or if you don't take 170 let's take it 160 maybe you think why 170 let's take it 160 because it's more than 135 right so around 160 we are going to take but then with no indentation right but then obviously these two steps should be repeated so this should be in for Loop if you run this thing then that's it one line 100 then after tilting the head to 160 that's it now again you have to move to 100 then again tilt then again move like this so these two lines we going is going to be repeated so let's take a four Loop or we can we cannot take four Loop because four Loop we will take four Loop when we know the exact number of iteration but we don't know the exact number of iteration right suppose you know exact number of iteration and you you think that in range let's make it 50 and let's see so these two lines should be indented within this whole Loop right okay let's run this see what is happening now so now that's it it is drawing again and again on the same path it is going on the same star on the same line right but obviously there is no point to move this thing again and again on the same till 50 so we don't know exactly the number of iteration right so what should be the stopping condition we can decide that thing like if I'm moving something like this and once I be back on this point then stop the starting point so how to put this condition so at starting point we can check the heading of the turtle so let's check this thing at starting if I print Tom dot heading let's make it 170 because 160 it's more than 160 from that image from that star I hope you have figured it out the angle was more than 160 let's move this to not 100 it's 200 and let's print the heading as well see now the heading is 0.0 right okay let's see what is happening here so this is the star this is something like that Turtle Star right that that we have seen we have to draw but now see again now at this point of time it is moving again and again on the same line on the same line why so because you have given exact number of iteration 50 but we don't want the exact number of iteration right so when to stop see we have a method here heading you can check to this uh you can say python documentation Turtle Lo heading see Returns the turtle current heading value depends on Turtle mode actually so if the turtle is we have moved we have tilted the turtle head to left 67° then heading would be 67 right so if turtle is straight then heading would be obviously zero so at exactly at this point of time the heading what was Zero let me just show you again see the heading is zero so we can put some condition rather than this rather than this let's stop this just put y Loop because if you don't know the number of iteration then just we use while loop while trip and we just put in the Y Loop the stopping condition if the heading ter do heading is equal to is equal to Z again then out of the loop means break for that also we have a keyword break just use that right so no need to print this heading now because that was we want to know exactly at first The Heading position was so again if the heading position reached to zero then just stop right and if I draw here one if I again write the angle 160 then see what is happening see this is the star but this is not exactly what we want and see once the turtle is again here stop right okay now what about fill color you have to fill the color also yellow right so for that obviously we have to fill any shape first you have to use begin fill end fill so at first to dot begin fill after that while loop and draw that shape and after while loop to Dot and fill the turtle object do end fi let's run this and this time it will show you but yeah obviously you have to change the angle it should be more than 160 right if I take it 165 so you can take this thing different different angle you can take and you can check out the shapes but exact if you want this Turtle star that was in Python documentation then I am going to tell you the angle is 170 exact angle is 1 170 here also you can see the angle is 170 on this documentation also you can see somewhere see angle is 170 right so angle is 170 like this right if you want to change the turtle shape or you want to hide the turtle just do that thing if you want to change the speed of the turtle you can do that thing you can play with this game and I mean play with this code and you will be ending with different different shapes I guess right okay this is the one shape now second shape is okay so this is our second shape see there are circles right and circle circle circle we repeating the circle but first Circle then till tilt the head of the turtle to some point then again a circle then the tilting uh angle is sh same then again at the same angle tilt the head then one more Circle one more circle like this like this like this spiral type right and when it is going to end at last it will reach to the original Circle then it is going to end fine but one more thing here every time for the the circle every time almost every time the color is different right so you have to implement that concept also random color you have to choose that also we have seen in previous video according to RGB values in the tle in pen color you have to give RGB values in the range of zero to color mode right and color mode is either 1 or you can say 255 if you set color mode zero then RGB value would be from 0 to Z and that would be black every time the color would be black so no point to set the color mode to zero either you can set to one or 255 if you set to one then also 0 to one RGB value would be 0 to one like in decimal point 0.1 0.2 like like this something like this right that is also fine but generally we take color mod to 255 right as you can go to the TK color specification and there also you will see I have shown you this thing this thing many time you can search P specific and because the method pen color and all take the color from the Stik color specification so see RGB value is something like this in uh not in floating point value some integer value right so these are color and these are RGB values so you have to generate these RGB value differently according to that color would be generated right see now we are done at last when we read reach to the original Circle stop so here also 2 to three concept you have to implement first draw a circle then the angle you have to find out or how you are going to move that Circle or the Tilt the turtle I don't know you have to find out then random color you have to choose and then stopping condition you have to add these three or four things you have to do right so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this let's just comment out these things and okay this thing we want first three lines right again let's copy paste these things and will will remove these comments right and one more thing at last also we want S1 do exit on click this thing also we want right now you have to write down the logic here in between so same stopping condition we can take see if I draw a circle something like this if my turtle is here right so first draw a circle something like this okay it's not a circle but let's assume it's a circle right then tilt the head of the circle to some angle and again a circle would be from here something like this right and again to same distance Circle will be something like this and when you have to stop when again we reach to the original the first Circle so same stopping condition we can put like heading at first heading was zero so you can check if the heading is again reached to zero then stop fine but the angle is what so this angle is like if this this is the line X XIs and Y y AIS this is something the line right so this was our first Circle so we are just it angle is just like maybe 5° or something like this 5 6° so first let's draw the circle to dot we have Circle and just uh we going to take the radius 100 then move to left with 5° small angle will take as you can see from that shape only it's very small angle or if you take more angle like maybe if you take 10° then also I'll show you you can check out this thing I'm taking just five you can just check different different angles but these things should be repeated these two things and when to stop that also we know so while while loop is best to use in this case because we don't know exactly the number of iterations right so just this should be indented and if stopping condition is same if the this heading equal to equal to zero again then just break from the loop out of the loop just break right but one thing we are still left with like the RGB color right because every time this time this this would be color would be black only see this is black only right right yeah obviously so for color also we have done that concept RGB value every time obviously in for Loop we will or you can make a separate function also every time just uh generate the RGB value so R is equal to randomly you have to generate So Random dot we have a function in random module that is Rand end and the value would be from 0 to 255 the the color mode zero to color mode so color mode I'm setting 255 so first you have to set the color mode here color mode of turtle not for Tom right see after creating Tom if I write Tom do color mode there's no color mode method here for the object it's for turtle so you have to set for turtle dot color mode is 255 this thing you need to take care so it's Auto automatically see import random import Turtle this thing you have to do because by using this line we haven't imported this Turtle we have just imported from this Turtle module Turtle class and screen so you have to import this Turtle module as well to use this line Turtle color mode right so R is this same for G and B so this thing this RGB value would be randomly from within 0 to 255 right so just set the the pen color before drawing the circle so Tom do pen color and here as a tle just provide r g b value this thing in detail we have discussed in previous video random kind of thing and how to generate the random RGB value random color according to RGB value right so like this let's run this and see what is happening here see now the turtle color is different different every time it is choosing the color from that according to RGB value right and let's make it fastest let's increase the speed of this storm do speed is fastest or you can write down here zero is also fastest and 10 is also fastest zero means no animation so let's run this now see it will look something like this and stop once original position it will lead to the original Circle just stop right so these kind of shapes also we can draw with these Turtle Graphics so you can play around with this code changing the angle or changing the speed or other thing also you can change rather than Circle you can draw something else it's up to you right different different shapes so next in next video we'll do a project using Turtle Graphics right so now I'll see you in the next till then byebye take care
