so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen python list what is list why we use lists advantages of using list characteristics of list some some functions we can use with list like list methods right now in this video we'll talk about randomization so more specifically if I say then talk about random module right now what is randomization and why we need see in our daily life like when you play that uh any dry skin right and when you throw a dice then any number can be there between one to six right like we are playing Ludo or any other game but the number would be between one to six one and six both are included like one two three four five six any number can be there if you are playing that game Tetris game the block which is falling from you know upside which is completely random we cannot predict like it would be a t or a square or what is that block the next block right if you know what is the next block then definitely it would be no fun to you know in playing those games so that is what randomization right so same when you write these kind of develop these kind of games in you know programming programming also we need randomization so how you can create that randomization in computer programming in you know through your programs how can you write down those programs right so in Python there is a inbuilt module which is called random module you don't have to write down the complete code behind that randomization you know that maths and all behind that thing right so python use that mercen twister algorithm for pseudorum you know random number generator program algorithm right if you want to read then you can read that algorithm if you are really interested in going into no into that much detail then you can go through that algorithm but they have already created So Random is an inbuilt module in Python you just have to use it that's it if you want to drink coconut water so is someone has already done that work for you and you will just go to market and buy coconut water and you will just drink right so same here also someone has already done that work for you someone has already created random module you can directly use that module and you can do whatever you want to do you can use that functions whatever is there in that module right so there is a random module in Python so how you can import that module in your program if you are writing your program then you have to import first of all that module so what you will write like this import and random now this is the module now whatever functions are there in this module like uh to create a random integer or to Generate random floating Point number two if there is a sequence like a list or a tuple or a set from that if you want to choose a specific sorry a random number a random item sorry then you can there is also a specific function for that theme also right within that within a specific range if you want to you know pick a random number random item then also you can pick so these functions are already there in this module you can directly use that for those functions in your program and that's it you don't have to go you know what is behind the scene the logic the code the maths and all right so what we can see basically random this this module is a inbuilt module in Python that is used to generate pseudo random number not random number it's pseudo random numbers because these numbers are not you can say truly random these are deterministic right these are not truly random that is why we cannot use this this thing for you know security purpose right there are some functions let me just write down those functions first so these are few functions see Rand end function will pass to argument A and B it means it will return a random integer number between A and B right and these A and B are both are included both inclusive Rand range A and B this also returns an integer number between A and B but in this case what is the difference from this function a would be included the first number but B is not included right so here if there like a number would be a less than uh sorry if it will return a number X so that would be something like this in this range right greater than a or equal to a less than b or equal to B but here only a is included B is not included it would be less than b b is not included random this is module also this is function also right so it will return a floating Point number and by default the range would be of that floating Point number would be 0.0 2 or let me just write down something like this less than equal to X and less than 1.0 this would be included but it is the one is not included it would be less than 1 only like 0.9999 and something like this but not one so it will run a floating by number uniform if you want to this will later on a floating Point number but if you want to give a particular range then we will use that uniform function choice if you want to select a particular sorry random item from a sequence sequence means it can be a list or set or Tuple then we use this function so Shuffle means if you want to shuffle any sequence let me just show you how can you can use these functions in your program so let's create a new file for this random underscore module Dot py so first of all we have to import the random module then whatever function in that module we can use those those functions so import random right now first thing we are using Rand int function right so the range I am giving like 1 comma 3. and whatever it will return so this is this is the function right so how you can use this function in your program it's not like that directly use this function brand int and whatever it will return let me just store that into a variable a a is equal to this right and just print a this is not okay what will happen let me just show you right let's change this to current file and let's run this see one error the name Rand hint is not defined because this is defined in this module so for use for use you know to use these function you have to first write down the name of the module dot the function as you can see see we have just pressed that dot and you can see the function ran into Shuffle uniform random brand range all these function Choice choices many functions are there right all these functions so now let me just run this and show you what output you will get see at this time we are getting 1 so it will return an integer between the range of one and three but one and three both are included so you can get one also two also three also let me just run this again this time you are getting three let me just run this again this time again three three again one this time we are getting two right so the range you can take like one two seven in this time you are getting seven like this right now let me just use another rather than this we are using a Rand range function and you will see the difference now now a is equal to random module dot this Rand range let us just provide uh like 1 comma three same I am providing between 1 and 3. but here you can get one and two only three is not included one is included 3 is not included so let's run this so you are getting two this time one now one one again two one right but you are not getting three so in Rand range this three would not be included right okay now I don't want integer number I want the ah that floating Point number so this time in a I am storing floating Point number so Random Dot random and a module name and function name also so it will return floating Point number between 0.0 to 1.0 but 1.0 is not included let's just run this C this is the number let's run this again C again again every time you are getting a different number or maybe sometimes you can get same number right but most of the time you will get different number right but I want a float number in a Range like between two and five right so for that random is by default taking range 0 to 1. so for that we will use uniform so in the next line we are taking a is equal to random dot uniform and let's just provide a range between 1 comma three let's take the same range see 1.9 this will give you floating Point number every time different number now let's uh take one list and from this list I want a random number right so so for that we will use what random Dot and choice in choice in this function we'll just pass the argument list l now let's run this and see it will print it is printing 90 so it has chosen this number this time again 56. again if we Run 2 so any random item from the sequence you can choose right if you want to shuffle the list then we can just random load rather than choice we can use what Shuffle and in bracket in argument just pass the list right and just now print this list right rather than a because this is complete list so just use this and print now l it will Shuffle this list so let's run this and see now 89 is at first place then we got 90 like this Shuffle has shuffled the items in this list let's run this again and this time you will get different thing right here in the documentation you can go like in Python documentation you can go this is the render module and you can just straight this out there are many function right see there are many functions here function for integer we have discussed this like Rand range Rand int some functions we have discussed like choice we have discussed Shuffle and this random we have discussed for floating number this uniform right so I hope you got basic idea of randomization random module and what are different functions you can use in Python you know we haven't discussed all the function you can go through all the functions right we have you we have discussed some basic functions only right now in the next video we will see one coding exercise in that exercise this randomization would be very important this topic that is why I have discussed this thing the basics of this thing only not in detail right so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
