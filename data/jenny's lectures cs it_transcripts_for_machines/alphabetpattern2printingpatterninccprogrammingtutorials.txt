in the stage of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs in c so in this video i'll talk about how to print this pattern you'll see the logic on this whiteboard then i'll show the output on my laptop see this is the actually same as we have discussed in the previous video but it is reverse of that pattern there we have discussed in the first line a in second line a b then abc then a b c d and a b c d e but here in the first line we are printing a b c d e then a b c d then a b c like this so it is reverse of that you have to change a little bit see all the printing pattern programs means most of the printing pattern programs are same the structure the outer structure the logic is almost same you have to change a little bit in every printing pattern programs so you have to think a little bit and you will get it right so please don't think that there are so many printing pattern programs and these are so difficult no almost all the printing pattern programs are same if you if you got once like for one or two printing pattern programs if you would have to think the logic what should be the outer structure the general structure like two for loop outer loop would be responsible for the these lines and inner loop would be responsible for the columns like this then you can easily handle any printing pattern programs right so now see first thing you have to do you have to analyze this pattern and you have to divide the pattern into number of rows and columns right so in this one we have how many rows five rows so outer loop we generally take what variable i that should run from one to five four five rows for five lines right now simply the outer loop would be from one to five that's it this is very simple now the inner loop would be responsible to print for printing the actual printing one two three four five columns are there and j is responsible i mean we are taking a variable j for inner loop but we cannot directly write j is equal to one to five like we have done in the outer loop why because see in the first line j is executing five times but in second line j is executing only four times in third only three times here only two times and here only one time because here i am printing only a in first column i am printing remaining four columns are what empty empty right so j is changing we cannot directly write j is equal to one j should be from one to five here you have to think a little bit now what should be the stopping condition for j now j is equal to 1 and j less than equal to c so now here c it is always not true that the outer loop should be from 1 to the maximum number that is here we have five lines so one to five maybe you have to change a little bit the outer loop see here in this case you have to analyze the pattern for that thing there can be multiple ways to print this pattern but i am discussing only one way right see when i value is one j is executing five times when i value is two j is executing four times like this but see if we write i in reverse order like this i should run from 4 then 5 4 3 2 1. obviously if you write something like this then also it will print 5 lines only only difference is i should run from 5 i should start from 5 to 1 so condition should be i should be greater than equal to 1 and here i minus minus not plus plus same thing right now here to find out this condition we are just writing this right if you write this then it would be easy to find out this j condition the inner loop condition when i value is 5 j is also 5 j is also executing 5 times when i value is 4 j is also 4 when i 3 j is also executing 3 times right means how many times j is executing same as the number of i right so here what should be the condition j should be less than equal to i and j plus plus that's it right and here what you will print because you are printing alphabets character so that is why i am writing here percentage c to print a character but see here what is the case what you will write here to print a b c d in the first row and a b c d in the second row like this see if i write something like the 64 plus what j right obviously j is what integer we are taking j integer before this we will have to declare you will have to declare the variables in i and j i am not trying writing the complete program here right so integer value is j either 1 2 3 and 64 is also integer we can add this right and if you're writing percentage c then whatever the integer value is here the corresponding character value would be printed right and these characters would be stored using sky character system in computer memory and a is what 65 in sky system b is 66 67 68 69 like this so if we write this in integer form then what would be the case here this is the pattern but we are not printing integer value we are printing corresponding character value of these right so i'm writing that by 64 plus j and in the outer loop i'm writing slash n for the new line now let me try run this program for you see first of all i value would be initialized with 5 5 greater than equal to 1 yes condition 2 will enter here now j would be initialized with 1 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition 3 will enter here and what would be printed percentage c 64 plus j j is 1 that is 65 and corresponding to 65 the value is the character is a a would be printed now j becomes 2 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition 2 will again enter here now 64 plus 2 that is 66 that is b would be printed right now j plus plus that is 3 how many times this loop would be executed 5 times because condition is less than equal to 5 so that is why here what would be printed a b c d and e right when j value becomes what four then five then six then this condition is not true exit from the loop slash n means new line cursor would be new line right now i minus minus i becomes now 4 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition 3 will again enter here and again j would be initialized with 1 right condition true which is 1 less than equal to now i value is 4 1 less than equal to 4 yes condition 2 again enter here 64 plus j j is 1 then what e would be printed that is 65 right now how many times this inner loop would be executed four times so what would be printed a b c d right when j value becomes what then two then three then four once j value becomes five exit from the loop and cursor would be new line right so i hope you are getting we are how we are printing this now i value becomes what three condition true again enter here now three times this loop would be executed so a b c would be printed now i value becomes two two times this loop would be executed so av would be printed and i value becomes one only one time this loop inner loop would be executed and a would be printed once i value comes zero this condition is not true zero greater than equal to one not real exit from the loop and we got this pattern right so i hope you got how we are printing this pattern so you have to change a little bit either in this condition or either in the outer loop or the inner loop condition right if this kind of pattern the reverse type of pattern you are getting simply you have to think like we can we can do it we can reverse the outer loop outer loop should be from five to one i mean the maximum lines are five so five to one if this is the simple loop not reverse i mean simple pattern like a then a b a b c something like this so simply you can run this outer loop one two five the maximum number of lines right once you will practice 10 15 printing pattern programs you will automatically get once you see the pattern you will automatically get the loop condition and what what what what you have to write to print that pattern right but you have to practice for that thing you have to practice 10 15 20 printing pattern programs right so now here one assignment for you is you you have to print what this pattern you have to print this pattern please don't copy and paste please first of all think how to print this pattern if you are not getting then you can take help from internet right but please don't try to open paste from somewhere right now let me show you the output for this program on my laptop so now let me create another file for the second pattern named alphabet pattern c and this is almost same as the previous one that is what i am copying the previous uh code just to save the time and we have to change a little bit it is just reverse of the previous one right here in the first row we are printing five lines but here i am taking what the user should enter number of rows yours you want to print like 5 10 15 so that is why we are taking here rows so what change we have to do the for loop the outer loop should be what from maximum to one so here i am writing what i should be i first of all initialize with rows and i should run from rows to 1 i should be greater than equal to 1 and here one more change i should be minus minus otherwise this would be an infinite loop right and that's it they should be same i j would be 1 to i and we will same we are printing j plus 64 right so now let me just run this program for you and it is asking number of rows let me enter 5 and see it is just reverse of previous one right let me run this again for 20 number of rows and see right let me just run this for 30 number of rows and let's see what it is printing see here it is printing different different characters not abcd right because abcds are only till 26 but i am printing 30 rows so that is why different characters it is printing right means sky value the sky value it is which is computed here corresponding to that what whatever the character is this is printing here i hope you can see this in at the end of these first three or four lines right so now that's it so i hope you would have to print this pattern i'll see in the next video with a new pattern till then bye bye take you
