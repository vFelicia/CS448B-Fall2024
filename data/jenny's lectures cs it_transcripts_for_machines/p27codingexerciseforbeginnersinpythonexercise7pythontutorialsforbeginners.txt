so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen nested if nested refills and alif statement in Python how we use them in program right so based on that we'll do one coding exercise see I hope you remember one exercise we have done that was according to size number four we calculated BMI body mass index right just enter your weight height and BMI calculate BMI weight divided by height square and it will print what is your BMI bye here we will do one more exercise on BMI we'll calculate BMI but that is you can say updated version of BMI the previous coding exercise after calculating VMI you have to tell if you are underweight or you are a normal weight or you are overweight or you are in which category you are right like this so after calculating BMI like this you have to tell will not you know put these condition will one condition will put like if your ebmi is less than 18.5 then you are underweight right then one is for normal weight between 18.5 less than 25 then normal weight if greater than 25 but less than 30 then overweight if greater than 30 but less than 35 then obese and greater than 35 then you can say Class 2 or clinically obs right so this you need to print so obviously you need to put here if else right so now one thing is what so this was our previous program and the weight height then calculated BMI we have converted weight into int and high into float and we just print BMI you have to convert this into int right because a whole number I want to print if I run the scoring exercise then see if run coding is a size 4. enter weight suppose 48 enter height suppose 1.5 and 21.33 like this if you want to convert this you can we have discussed round function so you can round this out right now you have to put these conditions as well now so both height and weight will take in float so better we can do one thing we can convert while taking input we can convert those into float right so here only I can write float same for height we can write down float here right now BMI no need to convert here you can just remove this and directly just convert BMI sorry calculate BMI fine now after calculating this BMI will not print we will put some condition if BMI is less than 18.5 then you need to print what print first we will print your BM BMI is and something like this I am printing BMI is this and you are underweight right so obviously we are using this kind of thing like in these curly braces we are using BMI so from BMI I want to evaluate this value I want to fetch this value so this is what that we have discussed this is F string so better to prefix this with f right now see it has changed its color BMI so it will fetch the value from here like this now second condition what will we have if we have more than two alternative we use alif so else if basically so that is alif L if BMI more than 18.5 means greater than or equal to 18.5 but it is less than 25 right so those will fall in this category fine then your bmi's we will just print BMI we optimize this and you are it's a normal weight category so we can say you have a normal weight right same you have to put all the conditions right like this now overweight for obese and if less than 35 then in this category but if greater than 35 then you are clinically obese right so rather than putting any condition greater than 35 obviously other than that if we have put all the condition then we can simply put for last thing we can simply put else right no need to put the condition else if BMI is greater than 35 right so this is how we have used here F string as well as as well as one more thing BMI you have to round this I do not want the result in those decimal 21.3 this is something like this I just want 21. right so here one thing we have discussed what we can use round function to round the numbers right so just use Round Here I think now that is fine let's run this and I'll show you the output enter weight uh suppose 48 in kg enter heightened meter suppose 1.5 or 1.6 now your BMI is 21 it is it has been downloaded and you have a normal weight 21 means I fall in this category means you have a normal weight right greater than 18.5 but less than 25 so let me just run this again and let's me just show you suppose weight is 48 and height is one point six your BMI is 19 and now you have a normal weight this time your BMI is 19 but let's run this again and suppose weight is 59 and height is 1.5 now you are BMI 26 and you are overweight now I fall in this category overweight category right so I hope now you have done this exercise so now that's it for this video and I'll see the next video till then bye take care
