hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have done one coding exercise we have calculated the number of cans needed to paint a wall in this video also we'll do one more coding exercise now that is not so tough we have to calculate you have to find out the number is prime or not so you have to define a function you have to pass the number as an argument and you have to write down the logic to check the number is prime or not so there are C many logics many ways many approaches to find out the number is prime or not but if you are a winner then obviously you will select you will think I guess the normal one it's okay you will not consider that that optimization of the program as a important factor right now it's okay first write down the simple approach then you can try out different different approaches one by one we'll be discussing two approaches in this video with the help of program I'll show you but first you have to try this out right now before that just want to discuss with you something important something important especially important for those who are interested in making their career in data science or who are still confused about their career which field they should choose right so see data science is one of the fastest growing industry in the world right now right because by 2026 data science Industry is expected to generate 11.5 million jobs across the globe so in this field the opportunities for career growth are very high and even known it people can apply see there are plenty of opportunities in this field but not so many skilled professional to fill this role because what matters in the industry today is in demand skills relevant and handson experience rather than just conventional degrees so one of the best platform to get these indemand skills is odd in school and their six month data science bootcamp which would be started from 27th of May so the data science bootcamp is perfect for anyone who wants to access industry align education other reasonable price as you can see plus they have scholarship option of rupees 30k up to rupees 30k and no cost tmi's option is also available plus they have an discount of 10 000 rupees for early bird and that's not it it comes with proven placement reports and 360 degree placement assistance they have 500 plus hiring Partners the top tech companies like Accenture Deloitte Google and many more companies as you can see and don't just go with my words you can see their own success stories see this there are many success stories as you can see here one is vishweswari and she is now a senior Analyst at capgemini and uh she was a fulltime mother and had a career gap of six years and now she is a senior Analyst at capture my life so be it a career launch or career change or career growth data science has diverse opportunities for all the aspirants so if you would like to kick start your career in this field you're not in school today and what is the process to apply for this thing you have to just fill out this detail and request a call back sword in school team will call you back in within one hour two days so you can ask your doubts if anything you have right so the registration link and all the relevant information you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's pause the video and try out this program okay so I hope you have done this that was not so tough so let's create a new file land try this out it's prime number or you can say Prime checker crime Checker dot p y right okay so first thing we have to take a number input right so suppose we are taking a variable n and they are using input function we'll take a number like enter a number fine and during this time only we will convert this into int because by default using input if you take so that number would be considered as string so you Typecast that and that would mean end so suppose we are creating a function like Prime checker right and right now we are calling this function and we are passing this and in this function Prime Checker n but still we haven't defined the function so let's define the function first before calling you have to define the function otherwise it will give error it's not like that first we call and after that here we Define the function no before you have to define the function before calling so let's define this depth and same name you have to take and here just a variable to accept this n this number suppose we are taking number for same or you can take like n n that is also fine same variable name you can take right have to Define them how to check see we know one is not a prime number it's a composite number right so how to check if suppose a number is like we have our number five so how you will check it is a prime or not for sure it will be divided by 1 and itself one and five that's for sure but you have to find out any other factors so check if 5 is divisible by 2 then 5 is divisible by 3 5 is divisible by 4. till that number minus 1. right so if it is completely divisible like the remainder is zero then yeah it is having the number is having other factors as well and it is not a prime number right so first thing you have to use modulo operator to check the remainder we have an operator module operator so five like five this is more operator mode two equal to equal to zero right like this then again we check five mode three then we check five more four till 4 OK because we know 5 is divisible by 5 itself right so if number is 7 we check by divisible by two three four five six till that number minus one yeah it's very basic approach it's not so optimized approach to find out a prime number in case of if you consider that time complexity and space complexity okay but for beginner uh for beginners I am discussing this approach right because if you are a beginner if you are a name then obviously this approach will be in your mind rather than yeah there are many other methods also to optimize the solution right but this is the basic one right check with all the like two three four till number minus one okay and if it is divisible by any number like if I have 6 so 6 would be divisible by 2 as well as 3. right so obviously that is not a prime number okay because six mode two will be zero if you divide six by two then remainder would be zero so like this uh you know formula we will apply here so how to apply this thing and one is not a prime number it is a composite number so you can just write down like we check for I in range range would be from 2 to that number minus 1 2 2 if number is five then two to four we will check number minus one so here simply you can write down number because it will generate the range will generate if the number is 5 we are taking the number as 5 then it will generate 2 3 4 these three and these three numbers you want that's it because we know 5 would be divisible by 5 itself and one itself right so we check for I in this range like so if if the number whatever the number this number I equal to equal to zero means it is divisible by maybe either two three or four then it is not a prime number right so maybe simply you can write down here print it is not a prime number right and else it is not a prime number but here what do we take the general form we will take we will take a suppose variable here I am taking a variable like a number is available is prime equal to first I am setting it to true so if this is true this condition is true just set this variable is prime just flip this variable S Prime is equal to false right this would be in this if statement would be in for Loop that's it no need of else now after for Loop we check we check this variable is prime if is prime is equal to is equal to still it is true means we can simply print here and else we simply print not a prime number and what about if you want to uh write down that thing also what about the one if somebody enter one then what about that thing let's suppose we simply run this program right now we are not doing any update right now right so let's run this and enter a number I'm entering Phi it is a prime number see the number is 5 here number becomes 5 so is prime a variable that is true now for I in range two two numbers so it will generate two three four so first it will check the number is 5 5 more first time in i 2 will be assigned five more two equal to equal to 0 no if you divide 5 by 2 then remainder would be one so this condition is not true so control will not enter here so is prime is still true now I is I is 3 so 5 more 3 equal to 0 No 5 Mode 4 equal to zero no so control will not enter in this if block and after we are till 4 it will because now we are in end of the range range function like four so now this for Loop is complete now if is prime true yes S Prime is still true because control haven't entered in this if bro so yeah it is a prime number right or rather than if S Prime is equal to equal to true you can simply write down this thing if is prime that is also fine because S Prime is true so both are same but if I run this again and if I enter 1 then it is a prime number one is not a prime number we know it's a composite number right according to the definition of the prime number right so now why it is showing 1 is a prime number because number is 1 so range function obviously will not generate anything because 2 and number is 1 so 2 to 0 it should generate but that is not a valid range so it will not generate anything the portal would not be executed and is prime is true still so now this if condition is prime is true so control will enter here so it will enter it is a prime number so better here you write one more thing like if this number equal to equal to 1 so here we can simply flip this one this variable is prime is equal to false now let's run this enter a number one say not a prime number okay so if this is 1 is prime becomes false and follow who don't be executed because there is no range function obviously if the number is 1. so now if this if would be checked if S Prime no it is not true it is false so else would be executed and not a prime number like this so like this you can check if the number is prime or not but how you can update this thing rather than checking if the number is like if the number is Maybe 11. so we have to check two three four five six seven eight nine ten till 10 you have to divide this phone would be executed 10 times but there is no need why so if you check the number divided by 2 means 11 divided by 2 that becomes five point something so you can say let's suppose 6. so just check till 6. if there is if the 11 is completely divisible by till 6 2 3 4 5 6 then it is not a prime number no need to check till the number minus one right this is second approach I hope you got this so if I write down here this number divided by the range should be this number divided by 2. but 11 divided by 2 it would be some decimal so let's round up this number better round of this number rather than just rounding the number right so you will seal function so how to use you have to import first math module and here we can use math dot in previous video also we have used this one so you can check out that video seal number divided by 2 and better do plus one because the range would generate whatever this number minus 1. so here the number is suppose 6 so it will generate 2 3 4 5. 1 minus and we want it should generate till that number till that divided number that half number so better to add 1 here okay okay now let's run this and if I run 2 it is a prime number let's run this again three it is a prime number okay let's take a number six not a prime number so now this time complexity would becomes less because rather than rather than you know if the number is 11 so rather than comparing rather than you know uh generating this two three four five six seven eight nine ten till 10 it will generate only two three four five six like this right so less time it will take and there are multiple methods also not just these two square root method is also there that also you can do so you can just search how to find out the number is prime and order an optimized solution and you can try out that thing also right okay now you have to try out this is for your assignment these two methods we have discussed one two more methods you have to find out or at least one that square root method how to check the number is prime or not with that square root method right and you can just write down that chord the logic in comment section okay so I hope you have done this exercise so now in the next video we'll work on a project so now I see the next video thank you
