so in the series of learning c programming from this video i'm going to start a new concept and see that is file handling and see we'll see everything about file handling in c first of all we'll discuss discuss why we need file handling because whenever you go for a new concept or if you are a teacher and you are going to teach a new concept then first thing is you know you should find out the answer of why we need this concept right and what is this exactly first of all clear your fundamentals the basics why what questions and then go for the advanced topics in that concept right so first we will discuss in this video it's like when say you can say introductory part two files or you introduction to file handling in c why we need files in c and what is exactly a file right that thing will discuss in this video now all the topics all the advanced topics we'll discuss in later videos one by one and we'll call we will cover everything about this topic right before they just want to tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate 2022 examination then i hope you have done your preparation and it's the right time to start your revision so one academy is going to

of this video you can go and check out now see what is file handling and what is financing so first of all we will discuss who the need of this file the new file and agency see whenever you write a program you run that program suppose you are adding two numbers right like we have taken a and b two numbers a and b here we have five and ten so some would be like in in sum and that would be 15 right this is like you can say your console output screen console is what where the screen where you will you know the these output would be displayed right and whenever you run a program then the program would be loaded into the ram memory i hope you know this right and one memory is your hard disk right this ram is what volatile memory means whatever in this ram right that would be if whenever you will switch off your computer that would be gone right now in hard disk is what no volatile or you can say permanent memory right you will store anything in this this memory and if you switch off your computer and whenever you will turn it on automatically that data would be there right now suppose maybe you have not created anything like a document word document right and you have written something here you have saved that document right and you have saved your images or many data you have stored in your computer i hope you have in your laptop right but whenever you again you know you switch off your laptop and whenever you again open it that data would be there only right your all your photos your videos or everything whatever you have downloaded whatever you have created right so that is what you can say we have stored that data into hard disk that is permanent stories right but when a program you are going to run a program that would be loaded into the ram right now whatever the value you will enter like sum of two numbers so value i am going to enter 5 and 10 some would be 15 that would be displayed here right but after terminating of this program this data would be lost right because this is in ram whatever you are we are going whatever we are executing that processing that data is now that variables are in the value is in ram memory and ram is volatile memory whenever you terminate whenever you close that program those variables those values would be lost now again you can run that program again you are supposed to take new values and you can find out the sum it's just a simple example sum of two numbers right but suppose if i want that the data should be stored somewhere right like whatever i have taken previously 5 and 10 and the sum also i want to store i will now i want that after terminating after closing the program still this result or this data is there anywhere i don't know where but in memory it should be there and if i need in future whenever again i will run this program or any other program in there i will need this data so i can fetch that data so i want to store this data permanently so where you can store obviously in hard disk this is the permanent storage right and how you will store the data in this with the help of files files is nothing but you can say it's a sequence of bytes memory some memory right blocks where you can store data permanently that's it that is what a file right so here we have some files so file in file we have sequence of bytes only sequence of bytes memory is there it's like a memory only and where in these bytes you can store the data permanently that is file so files are used to store data in hard disk right permanently i hope you get this concept fine now first point is why you need these files suppose after termination of the program still you want to store the data then you can use file with right next thing is sometimes you want to enter a large amount of data right it's not easy to enter that amount of data right so if that data is stored in a file permanently in hard disk so you can access this file with the help of few commands you can write down few lines in your c program and you can easily access this file rather than entering that data because it would be a tedious task whenever you run a program suppose a program is something like that you can easily fetch the data from the file and that's it and that would considered as input of our program let's say if input of a program is very large so rather than typing or you know entering the data with yourself suppose that data is in a file so it would be easy to fetch that file you just have to write down few commands and that would be considered as input right and obviously for storing permanently the output you can store files one more thing you know ram sizes obviously ram is of small size other than that hard disk because ram is expensive than hard disk so it is not able to know ram cannot handle large amount of data so for that thing we need files so i hope this is clear to you why we need files in c so exactly this thing what is file handling you are supposed to handle these files suppose in a program you need a file you need a data but this is in the file and you need a data so you will fetch that right so this fetching or the writing something into the file or reading that file or opening a file creating a file this thing is what known as file handling simple you are handling files that's it you are creating files you are you know you can say if there is an existing file you are opening that file you are reading something from the file you are writing something into the file you are closing that file that thing is called file handling that's it and files are of two types text basically text and binary text means having note txt extension that those files and binary dot bin dot pin these are simple plain text files like here those you know you can write down anything like symbols alphabets numbers those are what with the simple text editor you can create these file like notepad or wordpad or document you know microsoft word those are text files you can easily read these files you can easily manage these files right but these are less secure binary files here the data is stored in the stream of zeros and ones so these are more secure obviously you cannot read easily this data so this is more secure than text files generally these are you can say the compiled files of these text files right you can see in your computer also don't bin files are also there you can open it and you can just see what is there in those files if you are unable to see those files or not right and one more thing if the data is in the files then you can easily transfer that data from one machine to another machine right that easy to transfer so i think this is clear to you what why we need these files right and what is a file what is file handling the types of files and operations you can perform on files what are the operations first is you can create a file right you can open a file if there is already a file in the hard disk you can open it with your c programs right you just have to write down few commands that also will discuss how you can open it how you can create it now you can read something from that file whatever is written in that file you can read it right you can fetch that that information you can write something into that file and if you have opened any file then you are supposed to close that file right this is very important to close that file so these are main operations on files many more operations are there one one by one will discuss all the operations with proper programs how you can open it how you can read the data how you can close that file how you can write something to the file how you can append something into the file everything we will discuss with the help of programs this is just an introductory part on files in c right and to handle these files you will need a pointer that is file pointer that is very you know important so that is one you can say use of pointers when you are going to handle the files you definitely need a pointer the pointer type should be phi this f i l capital f i l e this is something like when say it's a data type what is this the prototype prototype of this data type this is already defined in that stdio dot edge header file so about this also we'll discuss so one pointer we will need to handle these files you can say pointer pointer should be of this type s trick here you can say ptr this is a file pointer about this also i'll discuss in next video right so i guess that set about uh introduction to these files so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye bye take care
