hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in this video I'll tell you some reasons or you can say we will try to uh figure out some points why most people fail to learn coding why they quit why they give up I'm sure you have seen some people or some students around you or maybe you are one of them at some point of time they are super excited Super inspired to learn coding and they even start learning coding but after few days they quit they give up they never make it why so it's not because they are not smart enough to learn coding over there they are not from computer science background it's because they have done some mistakes while learning coding so in this video same thing we are going to discuss what are those mistakes and how you can avoid those mistakes right but before going to those mistakes let me just tell you about a platform or you can say a job platform in India which focuses especially on software jobs and the name of that platform is to end and here they have 6000 plus onboarded companies means six thousands plus companies are hiring and already three lakh plus users are using this platform and you can apply on any kind of job from this platform basically they're having two sections like one is for pressures job and second is other jobs fresher jobs so you can you can directly apply on their platform and you'll also find here startups Plus in other jobs where you will have many top tech companies and you will get link for those top tech companies and you can apply from this platform directly for those jobs as you can see here like full stack Developer jobs or designers of social media marketing for every category you will get here blockchain developer blockchain like machine learning engineers and internship as well as for jobs you will get every detail like this for internship it's a Stipe fund duration start date position for job you will get like the salary start date and openings and everything and if you click on that like apply now then this type of page will be opened and you have to like sign up you have to create an account if you are a new user you have to create an account to apply for the jobs right it means from one platform only you can apply for any kind of job and this job section or the internship section or job section is absolutely free now all the relevant links and details you will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out so the first mistake is you stuck into the tutorial track I'm assuming that you have spent enough time to search like which language is good which course is good and all and you have start learning you have started learning going for that course or started learning coding right now we are watching the tutorial you have chosen a course now you are watching those tutorials right now maybe you have spent your 50 hours or 100 hours watching that tutorial and now you are starting to code right means you are starting you you have started using those practice sites like maybe codewords or any practice site and you are not able to solve a simple problem why so because you are just learning from the tutorials you haven't practiced yet right so now again if you are stuck you again start watching those tutorials and all so you are now stuck into that tutorial track okay learn basic things to any part is also important learn the basic things and start applying that knowledge start working on projects start working simple working on you know start making simple projects simple applications very simple that's okay it's not like that you have to go to the higher level project at first no start making simple project whatever knowledge you have right now use that knowledge practice coding start coding don't just watch that tutorial only just sit and watch the tutorial and that is like a fake progress in your mind yeah you are learning coding but you are still a baby if you have watched that 100 hours of code that tutorial but you haven't practiced yet means you are still a baby in learning coding right so do Active Learning not just passive learning and those who do this kind of thing that passive learning just stuck in the tutorial wrap definitely after some time they are going to give up because they are not able to solve the problem they haven't practiced so they think that like I have watched this the complete course and still are not able to solve the problem so that is going to demotivate you and you will give up so do not just you know go into this tutorial trap start practicing with tutorial learn Basics things and start working on projects parallel right like maybe you have start learning coding start basic concept learn basic concept and then go to the practice sites there are many practice sites start practicing questions from that side then next concept then questions for that concept and then also work on Project as well right and one more reason why most of the people stuck in this tutorial trap is what because they take long breaks from coding like three days five days seven days or even months and once after months like after one month they start again from from you know they are going to start learning coding from where they have left then they are they are going to blank definitely because you have taken a long break you are not consistent so again you will watch the tutorials and all that's it so that is why you are again going to try going to stuff into this tutorial track so be consistent do not take long breaks okay one day break two day break is fine but try to avoid even one day break practice for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or 30 minutes at least if you are not going to devote like one hour to R2 for practicing questions right so at least 30 minutes or 15 minutes but do not take long dates right now second mistake is not finding out your niche now generally many people say that just focus on the general programming Concept in college as well they focus on the general programming concept like in every semester the C then C plus plus then Java then maybe python then data structure concept as well as algorithm concept but they just focus on the basic things General things they are not going to deep down into that thing right so you have to find out your niche okay like if you have some people do like what they are they have done a Java course now they don't know what to do next because they are not having a bigger picture right they haven't decided their niche they are still a newbie so that is that is the second reason and that is I think the most underestimated reason because everyone will say that just focus on General concept programming concept and that is fine do not go into deep and do not go in a specialist type of thing but I think which the important thing is you have to find out a niche that like if you are going for python or JavaScript like if you are going for python don't just be a python developer like go for Django Django specialist so rather than mentioning like three or five or seven uh you know programming languages in your resume just mention one or two but you have to be expert of into that programming language you have to be expert using Frameworks in those programming language you have to be expert you have like you have developed some projects using those Frameworks and those uh programming languages so like if you are going for JavaScript then deep down you can go for react.js you have idea of react JS you have developed you have used that thing in your project and you are exporting that thing using maybe node.js and next to JS like this so this is what finding out the niche and going deep down into that thing and become an expert rather than just doing multiple things at a time all the languages and not even know the you know any one language properly right so that is the second mistake third is you are doing it alone right so better to join some Community if you are learning coding better to join some Community there are free uh you know Forum also like you can join the stack Overflow Reddit many others are there many other free communities are there you can join them definitely there they'll post some questions answer and then go they are going to help you can post your question you will get answer from experts and if something like this you can do like you can join any paid course which is having a strong group a strong Community right so there that is going to help you definitely because you can ask your question you can discuss you can share ideas and they are going to definitely motivate you and all or maybe you can work with your friends from the same project you can share ideas with them and you can motivate each other so it's better to work it's better to work on Project or better to work better to learn coding in groups better to join communities rather than doing it alone because maybe sometime you will stuck somewhere and you will feel lonely and no is going you know nobody is there to motivate you and maybe you will quit right but there are some exceptional cases also those who love to work alone maybe so if you are one of them you can do it okay the next mistake is you underestimate the theory part because generally do generally what everyone says while it comes to learning coding then practice practice so you think that theory part is not important is also important do not underestimate the query part the concept the knowledge right I am saying do not underestimate that thing do not just only focus on theory part but focus on query part right like learn concept practice questions if you are stuck somewhere again revise that concept right do not just think I have done that concept I am still not able to solve that problem it's okay it happens with everyone just revise that concept that thing again and try to solve the problem knowledge now fifth reason last but not the least is people usually get scared of failures and errors right you are afraid of errors you get for the failures maybe you think that you you are not able to make it do not be so hard to yourself give yourself enough time to learn to fail and grow that happens with everyone no one is perfect everyone is failing and learning and then growing so give yourself this this cycle or this you know time remember why you have started this thing why and if you have started this thing like the law encoding and programming it's because everyone is doing this and you will get good salary and good salary package and a good job and all so learning coding or learning any programming language basic things is not that much stuff but becoming an expert in that thing need fashion patience time so if you have started learning coding because everyone is doing or just to get a good good job and all then you have to think again but if you are really passionate about learning coding then definitely it is for you definitely will not give up in spite of many failures and errors and all so I think these five are some common mistakes generally you know people or student do while learning coding and they give up if you think that you have done you are one of them and you have done some other mistake or there may be some other mistakes generally beginners can do then you can write on that thing in comment section right so now once in the next video till then bye bye take care
