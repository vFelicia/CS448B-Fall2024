in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs in c in this video i'll talk about how to print this pattern first of all we'll see the logic on this whiteboard we'll discuss everything then i'll show you the output on my laptop using vs code editor see it's very easy to print this pattern by looking at this pattern please don't think it's too tough to print first of all let me clear this thing it's very easy to print now why i'm saying this see in the previous two videos i have discussed these patterns like first of all this one see in one video we have discussed how to print this pattern full pyramid right in another video i have discussed how to print this pattern inverted full pyramid these are two different different patterns right and if we combine both the patterns then it will look something like this right but the only difference is here if we combine these two like these pattern then in this i am taking what five number of rows here also we have discussed five number of rows right but you can take whatever you want five ten fifteen twenty right so now here the maximum number of stars are nine right here maximum number of our stars are nine in one row only but if we combine these two pattern then two rows would be there having nine stars this is the only difference if we what if we combine coding to print this pattern and coding to print this pattern means you can print this pattern there would be no space obviously right right but the difference is here we have two number of rows having nine stars the maximum number of stars but i want what only one row that is having maximum star that is nine this is the only difference so you have to change the code a little bit right you can just copy the code of this pyramid this full pyramid as it is and the code of inverted full pyramid you just have to change a little bit there i want to print only one two three four lines not five lines because in five lines i have nine star but i don't want two lines having nine star so one would be like this from here to here this is full pyramid simply you can print the copy of this code and second one is from here to here here we have only four lines means we don't have this line having maximum stars so you can change a little bit this code i hope you are getting my point now i have already discussed this and this please check out the previous videos right i'll put though that uh c com programming list i mean the complete list for c programming link in the description box of this video first of all check out that playlist and check out these two videos now i'm writing the code here directly because i have already discussed i already explained properly the code of this thing right so i'm just writing the code am just combining this code in this code and whatever the change we do that i will discuss it right now see if you remember this this was the code from here to here to print this pyramid full pyramid right and from this for loop to here this word was the code to print this inverted full pyramid right now i have changed here a little bit because here the code was i was i is equal to rows i have done what rows minus 1 and i hope you got it why i am doing rows minus 1 right because here i want only one line having maximum number of stars i don't want to print this line in inverted full pyramid i want to print only four lines that is why i have initialized i with rows minus one number of rows see rows means total number of rows here i am taking only 5 so means rows here are 5 5 minus 4 that is 5 minus 1 that is 4. so this loop would be executed only four times means the outer loop would be executed only four times and the outer loop the highest loop is responsible to take care of these number of lines and here i want to print only four lines in this one right or you can change into this one this loop what you can do you can run this loop only four times from here to here and the inverted full pyramid you can print full like this right so this this change you can do here now here you can do i one i less than equal to rows minus one that's it this loop would be executed only four times either this for this right now maybe you are thinking that in previous video i have told you first of all divide this into number of rows and columns so here we are having how many rows one two three four five six seven eight and nine number of rows right so maybe you are thinking the outer loop should be from one to nine yeah that's exactly we have discussed in previous videos all the previous videos but you have to think differently also right here just combination of this pyramid and inverted full parameter and you will get this thing no need to do like i from one to nine and then how will you print this pattern right you have to think a little bit in a complicated way maybe maybe there are some more ways also rather than just combination of these two patterns maybe there are some different ways also you can also print like this only outer loop would be from one to nine and using some loops or some complicated coding you can print this pattern i agree there can be multiple ways right i am just discussing the simple and only single way here right just combination of these two pattern you will get this thing right now see let me just try run this first of all it will ask from the user enter number of rows you want to print and suppose you number of rows i want to print are five i have entered five right till maximum maximum number here in this line i am getting maximum number of stars so till here how many lines one two three four five right now i is equal to one i would initialize with 1 1 less than equal to number of rows 5 years condition 2 we will enter here space is equal to 1 right 1 less than equal to rows minus i rows 5 minus i value is 1 that is 4 one less than equal to four yes condition two will enter here and space would be printed one space would be printed like this the space would be printed right now again space plus plus now the space loop would be executed how many times this is what four four times means four space would be printed one two three four right when space become five condition not true exit from the loop now j loop j is equal to one is one less than equal to two into i minus one i value is 1 means 2 minus 1 that is 1 yes condition 2 will enter here and 1 star will be printed now j plus plus that is 2 but this condition is not true exit from the loop and slash and means we'll go into the next line right now it's not like that after this these loop would be executed no we are still into this outer loop outer row right now slash and after that i plus plus now i value becomes 2 is 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition true again we will enter here and like this we will execute the this thing till i value becomes the 3 then 4 then 5 5 times it would be executed means still here the pattern would be printed five times five lines right now i become six conditional now exit from this outer loop exit from this outer loop now after this for loop we have this line now these four loop would be executed right now again i value becomes now i value becomes what rows minus 1 number of rows are 5 minus 1 5 minus 1 that is 4. now i value becomes 4 right s 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition tree will enter here now space would be initialized with 1. now 1 less than equal to number of rows minus 1 5 minus sorry minus i 5 minus i i value is 4 5 minus 4 1 that is 1 space would be printed means one space would be printed now space plus plus but now space becomes two but this condition is not true only one space would be printed now that's it we exactly want one space now the star loop the loop which will print star that would be executed this loop now j becomes 1 now 1 less than equal to 2 into i minus 1 i value is 4 that is 8 minus 1 that is 7 yes condition 2 we will enter here 1 star would be printed now now j becomes j plus plus that is two now how many times this jl would be executed because here we have condition seven means seven times one two three four five six seven so seven star would be printed when j value becomes eight exit from the loop and in the outer roof slash and so come in the control will come in to the next line right now what i minus minus now pi becomes three now again this condition true we will enter here and again the whole process will be repeated till 3 2 and 1 yes 4 times means still here when i value comes 0 this condition is not true then stop it and you will get this pattern right so we have just changed what we have just done i is equal to rows minus 1 here that's it if you print this if you want to print this full pyramid inverted full pyramid you have to initialize with i is equal to rows only total number of rows that's it right and if you want to print this pattern like two rows are having maximum number of stars then no need to change this simply combine the coding for printing this and this that's it no need to change and that we have already discussed right in my previous videos so i hope you would have to print this pattern now let me show you the output so now let me create a new file named pattern 10 dot c right and i'm just combining the previous two pattern right so this was to print the full pyramid just i just copied this one first right and this was to print the inverted full pyramid so here i am not going to completely code the complete one to copy the complete code i am just copying the the logic means from the for loop only right because we don't want header file and those these starting to all three lines again and again right so now i have just combined those two now before any change just i'm just running it and i'll show you the output now see enter number of rows five see here we have these two rows are having maximum number of stars but the actual printing i want in the actual pattern i want only one line right so for this we have to change a little bit you can just do rows minus one in the inverted full pyramid i would be initialized with rows minus 1 and that's it now let me just run this and enter number of rows 5 and that's it only one row which is having maximum number of this only maximum number of stars now let me just run this for 10 number of rows and that's exactly you want this pattern right i hope now you got it if you don't want to change here if you want don't want to change here i should be number rows only so one more thing is here you can change in the first one i is equal to 1 and i should be number of rows minus 1 that's it and now let me just show you the output see it is asking number of rows you want to print and i am entering 5 and see you this pattern you are getting right so you can change either into this loop or this loop i hope you got it now
