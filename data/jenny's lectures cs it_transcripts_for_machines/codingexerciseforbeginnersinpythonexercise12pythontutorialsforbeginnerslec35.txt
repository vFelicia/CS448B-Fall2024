so in a series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen randomization random module their function and based on that we have done one coding exercise heads or tails means you have written a virtual coin dose programming right it will generate a random number either 0 or 1 and based on that you will tell it it's heads or things that was simple one but in this video we'll discuss one more coding exercise that is little bit complicated but if you have you know idea of that randomization all the random functions and all properly then you can easily you can easily solve this uh problem right now what is this problem statement see suppose four or five five friends are sitting in a restaurant now who will pay the bill so for that for that they'll use a technique what is that technique everybody will give their credit card or debit card or business card in a bowl or maybe in someone's hand right and the waiter or anybody from you guys will pick one card without seeing the cards right we'll pick one card and that person is going to pay the bill the person selected will pay the bill for everybody's you know food right that is one technique I have seen this thing in uh one of the Instagram reel also so this idea we are going to implement right so that is the thing but the idea is now how you will take input from the user using input function you will take names what I want is this kind of output let me just show you so the output should be something like this it will ask like enter everybody's name separated by command suppose I am entering like Jenny comma supposedly so let me just enter and it's print any name like it between any name like grtr will pay the bill something like this right or rather than this directly printing this what we can do like this we will enter the name then it will print the list so it will separate these into with different different items and it will create a list something like this and then it will pick anyone from this list like this time Gia will pay the bill so this type of account I want so I hope you got what kind of output we want so what hint let me just give you some in first of all there are multiple ways so we'll discuss two ways here you can use this Choice method from a list it will pick a random item so maybe you have a list of names just use this Choice method and it will pick a name and that's it it will be two line of code but this is very simple we will not use this Choice method without Choice method you have to write down this program right without Choice maybe you can use Rand enter and range or random function any function right now see when whenever you will enter we will enter using input function uh you know names multiple names so there is one function let me just give you one hint split what does function perform this suppose I have this text suppose I have this text so welcome to Jenny's lectures I want to split this complete string this is complete string and I want to split this and make a list right so how to use this method this the name of this complete string text Dot split and in bracket you will just provide the operator or the thing at which you want to split this string suppose I want to split this whenever a space it's just a space whenever space will find this you know the split function will split this string and after that it will store this into a you can say a text underscore splitted this variable and I'll just print this text underscore split it so what output you will get split function will split based on this operator space so output would be a list welcome okay space so welcome then it will split then T O2 then against space split then something like this now these are individual items in this list this is a list and these will come as an item to Jenny's lectures these are individual items and you can access these items now with help of index so this is at zero index then one then two then three how to access that I guess you know just name of this list support name of this list is text splitted in this square brackets just put the index like 0 then it will print welcome so this is one hint you have to use split right and another hint I have just told you in this only using this index you can access this so maybe you can generate rather than this you can obviously we know we can generate any random integer number 0 1 2 3 in a Range we have a function random so you can use that thing you can generate any random number and based on that random number you can map this random number to this like two and like at this place we have Jenny the name Jenny then simply you can print Jenny will pay the bill this kind of thing right so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this exercise see this is how split function will work suppose in text we are welcome to Jenny's lectures and text Dot split but the operator I want to use is e or the alphabet I want to use is e whenever e it will find it will split that string from that point right now let me show you the output see this would be the output because after w we have e so w would be different item then lcom this would be different item because again we have e right then 2 then after J we have e so t o space j would be one item and it would be splitted from here then n n y l like this I hope you got this this how split function will work right now let's create a new file and this would be what coding exercise 12. so obviously we will do what randomization so first of all we will import random module right now suppose we are taking what names using input function obviously we'll take okay so I am asking like enter everybody's name separated by comma right because I want to use comma as a split operator right so just I want to split this names Dot split function and then in bracket comma this operator whenever the split function will find this operator it will split the string from there and make a list so we will store this obviously in a list so suppose names underscore list this is the variable I am taking right if you want to check out you can just print like it's working or not rather than writing the complete code at first so I'm just printing like names list right let's run this okay this is current good enter everybody's name separated by comma so suppose I am entering like Jenny comma then I'm entering Akash then comma then I'm in entering like ankur and that's it and enter see now it is a list Jenny is one item then Akash then separated by whenever it will get it will get this comma it will separate from there now we can we can access this list the items of the list using index so I guess now it's clear to you how to write down this code right so I'm not going to print here fine now split it now what we can do this journey is having index 0 Akash is having one anchor is having two so we can generate a random number within the range 0 to 2 0 is the index and 2. right and after that according to that index we can get the name right so which is the function Rand int and here you can pass the range 0 to obviously I cannot write down here 0 to like I don't know like like next time I'll put five names so obviously this would not be at static time at this time I don't know the length of this list so you have to calculate length of the list this is also important so here you can provide that ending point right so how you can using Len function we have a len function length and the list is now what this variable sorry length and here just pass names list so it will find out the length of the list now length of this list is one two three okay so it will give you three so let us just store that thing into a variable suppose I am taking length okay but so here what will you will pass length no because Rand n12 return an integer between 0 to length in this case suppose we are taking this list in this case length is 3 so 0 to 3 including 3 also and whenever it will return three suppose so at third index we don't have anything right so what name it will ping it will pick nothing so what you will pass Here length minus 1 till length minus 1 because the index is 0 1 2 length is 3 so 3 minus 2 sorry 3 minus 1 that is 2 till 2 so 0 to 2 including both 0 and 2 yeah that is fine now I hope you go to Y I am putting the range 0 to length minus 1 right now okay so it will generate any random integer number between 0 to whatever the length of the string minus 1. so that I am going to suppose uh store in a variable random choice in this variable right now suppose it has picked 0 to now suppose list is this 0 to 2 so it has to randomly 1. so in random choice we have now one so obviously we can at one we have Akash so we can access hakash we know how to access how to access just name of the list names underscore list that this variable is this names underscore list and in square bracket just pass one note one but obviously we are passing this variable random choice right and we can simply print this in print we can do this this thing right and if you properly want to write down like Akash will pay the bill so okay we can do that thing also in print we can use F string f and from here from here we can just access this this will pay the bill how to use a string if you don't know you can check out my previous video I'll put in this I button you can check out that video right okay sorry now from this variable it will pick so this will pay the bill right now I hope you got this this is that's it now okay let's run this and see you're getting the output or not phony let's enter okay sorry we cannot use this Rand in function like this my mistake we have to use random dot Rand hint like this okay I was just checking you are attentive or not okay jokes apart let's run run this again and see this time ankur will pay the bill maybe next time you will get other thing suppose we are see this time I am getting Jenny will pay the bill okay so this is how you can do without using Choice method I hope you go to this thing it's not that much tough right if you are not getting you can just watch the video again right now if you use that choice then no need to just calculate the length you can just comment out these two lines we have the list now now we can directly use like random Dot choice and this here just pass the list names list and whatever it will return suppose that name I am storing in the name person selected right so rather than this now at this time I am using what here person selected right say this time also okay not Jenny's it's Jenny but anyway we can write down Jenny also Jenny will pay the bill so simply using choice you have to write down just one line random load Choice the list it will pick the name the name suppose I am going to put in this variable person selected and from this variable we can just in F string we can pass this variable name all right or rather than this we can just do this thing in one line only F string from here here only we can write down this thing dynamodore Choice names list directly right say this time it is giving Akash will pay the bill right so I hope this is clear to you now the random module random function how to use them how to solve a problem using random functions at all right so now in the next video we'll see nested list so now we'll see the next video till then bye take care
