so we have seen shorthand effects but there are some more points you need to remember when you are using shorthand if else see this is the example we have taken even and code number you have to find out so in shorthand if else we can write down this thing first of all if clock statement then if the condition then else then else clock statement but you can use this shorthand if else if you have only one executable statement within this if and within this it's only one if this is the case something like this so I want to statement in this if flow so let's run this A6 so if you print even number and grade these two statement but if you want to write down this in terms of short and then how you will write first of all you will write if if Loop statement so there are two statements so we write print even number print great then if then condition then else but here it will give an error let's run this and I'll show you see syntax error this is invalid syntax only one statement you can print only one statement you can print here it should be one statement then you can use shorthand if else to write down this case so that's the next video till then bye take care
