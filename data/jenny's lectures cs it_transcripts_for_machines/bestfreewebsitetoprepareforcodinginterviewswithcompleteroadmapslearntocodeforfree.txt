this much more you will get i'll show you everything here first of all let me tell you the name of this platform yes this is code studio by coding ninjas this is the platform here you will get many things now what is this platform what is this website how to use this website how to you know use this website to gain maximum benefit from this thing because this is a free resource for you guys so better to gain maximum benefit from this website so how to gain that thing the flow how you should move what you should learn if you're a beginner what should you what you should learn first right to

this is the home page for this thing don't worry the link i'll put in the description box of this video just go to that link and you will be redirected here right now why you should use this code studio and what is this there are many other platform also available see here structured content is available for every skill which is needed for interview right many guided paths are available under

interview they're only on the platform by yourself so let me show you everything one by one see this is the platform uh the code studio by coding ninjas first of all if you are a beginner right and you want to get you ready for placement right you should go to guided paths right now here see many guided paths are available here the complete flow i'll show you what is this in guided path right path means from zero to pro level advanced level how you should move the path they'll show you so if you are a beginner you don't know anything first of all you can choose any programming language see dsa is very important for interview preparation of these companies data structure and algorithm for solving those problems obviously you should have knowledge of any programming language so you can go for this basics of c plus java or python up to you right and you will get a certificate also after completion right now let me just open one uh guide path for you let's say basics of c plus plus now what you will get here once you will you know click here get started you just log in with your google or facebook account or you can just create an account with your email address right now what is this in this module they have shown you what you will get see this is the module introduction to c plus first of all here you will get seven nodes theory you will get after that three problems also mcqs also you will get of 30 points you can attempt these question same then variables and data type first of all nodes you will get and then problems these are simple problems mcqs right once you go to this this thing like from basic to advanced everything they are going to discuss with nodes and problems right now you can solve dsa problems right you can go for dsa the guided path of data structure and algorithm here same you will get theory also notes as well as problems right competitive programming many for many things there are guided paths not it's not like that you should go for this uh you know c plus plus java or dsa for aptitude preparation as well because in interview first round is for apti so that also available here you can go for this thing right and the technology which are in trending see blockchain data science machine learning you will get here you know the path for this thing also blockchain machine learning data data science system design right now also a path for interview guide for product based companies so this also i think then you you should go for this thing if you are a beginner first you can go for programming then dsa you can learn then interview guide for product based companies here you will get c array the topic is array note you will get first of all the notes theory and then problems so you should try these problems see pair some problem overlapping problem you can attempt these problems from here right if you will click on the attempt the interface would be something like this right first of all read out this problem the difficult level of this problem is easy read out this problem statement notes everything first of all understand this problem input format output form and everything you need to understand right and then you can code here you can code here either in your python java c plus plus or javascript then you should run this test your problem against sample cases and then you can submit this problem right so this is the interface you can attempt the problem here right so for array then you will get multidimensional array string recursion and everything you will get here right which are asked in which would be the topics which are important for into preparation of product based companies problems of that you will get okay this is done now maybe okay you want to practice more problems so you can go for practice section and interview problems from there you will get interview problems of specific topic like for programming fundamentals data structure you can select any topic advanced algorithm maths and number theory so you can select a particular topic and solve the problem of that topic if you want right from here see these are the problems you can filter out these problems according to yourself like dynamic programming problem which which which you know filter you want to apply you can select this thing the topic wise you can select company wise you can select for which company see suppose you want to solve the problems which are being asked in amazon so you can select this amazon and there you will get these problems right make my trip microsoft you can apply any filter you want there are many filters difficult level filter also the easy mode rate hard apply the filter according to that the problem would be shown here and you can just click on that problem interface i
