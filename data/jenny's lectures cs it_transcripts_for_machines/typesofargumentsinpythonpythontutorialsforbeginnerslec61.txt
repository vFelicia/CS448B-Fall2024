hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of planning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen functions with arguments how to define a function with argument how to call that function what are arguments how to pass arguments to a function difference between parameter and arguments right but now we have different types of arguments in Python right so in this video we'll be talking about all the arguments the types of arguments in Python so basically we have four types of argument default positional keyword and arbitrary or this arbitrary is also known as variable length arguments further arbitrary are of two types like arbitrary positional argument and arbitrary keyword argument right and one is the we also discussed about required arguments right so basically these types of arguments we have now one by one we will discussing all the types of argument but with the help of program practically I will show you rather than on this whiteboard right so let's see okay so let's create a new file here and we'll be discussing here types of argument dot p y right we will see this thing with the help of example okay simple example let's take that grid function in the previous video also we have seen that function so this was our function grid we are passing only one argument here suppose I want to pass two argument like uh Department also so just one more variable name like one more parameter and Jenny and here I will pass like CS right and one more print statement here I want to print using F string are you from this department whatever value will pass here in this department from this department it will fetch the value right okay so let's run this and what it will show hi January from computer science department right okay now what is the problem if I pass here something like this first I'll pass this CS suppose and then I'll pass Jenny hi CS are you from Journey Department it doesn't make any sense right it's nonsense so what is the problem here because first we have passed CS because if somewhere if the user or anyone who is using this program the programmer is not aware about this definition right the definition of the function and yeah he knows that this there is a function grid function and it will accept two argument one is name and one is Department but he's not aware about the order the first name or first department or what right so maybe he'll call the function something like something like this first if you pass department and then Jenny then it will give it will not give any error but obviously it will give some nonsense output right we don't know that that thing so what we can do so here here see these are whatever we will pass here like first we have passed Jenny and then we have passed CS right now yeah this is making sense because Jenny would be go to name and CS would go to department so these are positional Department sorry positional arguments right means we are not specifying anything like which this you know which parameter would be associated with which value we are not specifying anything we are just passing two values and here it is it will accept two values so the first Jenny would Jenny is at first position so this would be assigned to whatever parameter at first position that parameter is name so Jenny would be assigned to name then second position is CS then second position parameter name is department so like that this would be assigned in order wise right so these are positional Department sorry positional arguments right not departments positional arguments I hope this is clear to you guys now the problem you got with positional positional arguments now to solve this problem we have another arguments you know department and other arguments that are keyword arguments right key word as the name suggests key is like value and word is specific what we will provide so how to provide those keyword arguments see first if I know like I don't know the definition of this function this is hidden from me but I know there is a function greet which will accept two arguments one is name one is department so I will prefer to provide keyword arguments like having two parameter name and DPT department so I will associate this thing like name equal to Jenny and the EPT this variable name equal to CS so I'll associate the value with the parameter name so this is what the name is your like a keyword and key the value is Jenny so these are keyword arguments now if I pass if I reorder this thing like if I pass first Department and then the value of J then also it will work fine see hi Jenny are you from computer science department CS Department it is working fine because if you change the order that also you know will not cause any nonsense kind of thing because we have associated the parameter and the value while calling the function so you don't need to aware about the order of the arguments while you are using keyword arguments that is a good point so why we use keyword argument that I think clear to you guys and there is mixture of positional and keyword argument also also possible like we can pass positional argument plus keyword argument in the same function call right okay let's see if I pass simply name and this name is what okay now tell me now name is what positional argument we are passing and department is what department is equal to CS this is what keyword argument so this is a mixture of these two that is also fine it will work fine name is not defined okay we cannot write down sorry like name here we have to pass the value obviously it's calling after this it's not definition it's calling okay let's send this that was my mistake see hi Jenny are you from CS department so this is what positional first position so at first position we have name so this would be assigned to name and then Department this is not keyword but here you have to Note One Thing this this keyword argument should follow positional argument if you say let's pass first keyword argument department is equal to Cs and then pass Jenny then positional argument this will give error see as you can see the red line here right whenever you click whenever the cursor will be here then positional argument after keyword argument but that is not possible here keyword argument should be after positional argument let's run this and see syntax error positional argument follows keyword argument positional argument follows keyword argument but that is not that is not possible here that will give error so always first positional argument if position argument one two three four how many argument you want to provide according to the definition of this thing then provide at last provide keyword arguments right it's not like that first keyword and then after that positional no that will give error right okay now I hope positional versus keyword is clear to you guys these two argument now we have default arguments as the name suggests by default you can provide some value right okay let's first correct this thing first you should provide Jenny and then departments is equal to CS this is given so now a default argument like let's take an example like your mom knows generally how many chapatis you eat so she is going to make like this so my mom knows she only make two pages for me daily I don't need to you know specify every day like Mom I'll eat I'll have two chapatis but by default in my mom you know mom's brain or you can say in my mom's function there is an argument number of chapatis for Jenny is equal to 2 by default value is 2. right but sometimes someday if I am not hungry much and I'll say like Mom I I'll have only one chapati right so now she's going to make one chapati for me not two one right so by default argument you can provide I hope now you got this idea by default what is by default value so now by default value where you will provide at the definition of the function right so if suppose by default I provide let's take one more variable like subject one more argument parameter name is this and Department by default by default I am taking CS right so if you will not provide at the time of calling any value or for this department variable it's okay it will take this by default value CS so at the time of definition you have to provide that default value of the argument right you can provide as many default arguments as you want like all the three arguments can be default arguments name is any subject is equal to python department is equal to CS it's fine right so I'm providing only one default argument here so I just want to print here one more uh statement like do you teach and whatever subject I'll provide this thing it should print right okay sorry now at the time of calling if I pass something like this like to only Jenny and I'm providing like python only two values so see at the time of definition we are having three parameters so at the time of calling we are I'm only providing two values two arguments so it will work there'd be no error hi Jenny do you teach python are you from CS Department because for this parameter if you are not providing anything any value while calling the function it will take the default value so like this you can you know avoid that error like missing required positional argument data right by default just provide a value and if suppose I here provide this value like Hemi now like I am providing mom please make one chapati for me like this Amazon one chapati so this this will override the default value so one chapati means my one chapati today it will override the two chapatis whatever is there in my mom's mind right so let's run this C are you from me department now this time it will not take the default value if you provide the value during calling so it will take that value so this value is going to override the default value right I hope you got this thing so sometime if you you know forget to provide this value the default argument value it's okay it will not give an error it will take the default value right okay like if you are any fun in any function we have like name of the student age this type of thing roll number and like uh college name so college name would always be same so just provide that for that argument call his name add equal to value anyway X Y College XYZ college right because for all the student like the college name would be same so rather than providing again and again while calling just provide one time the default value so it will take for all the students that default value so in this kind of kind of situations default argument would be very helpful for you right now here now see this is Department as default argument and name and subject these are you can say known default so these are known as required arguments right if I'll not provide this thing if I am passing only Jenny right let's run this this time you will get an error see type error this greed this function missing one required positional argument so this is what because one Jenny so at first position we have name so in name Journey would be assigned now subject this is also required argument because we are not providing any default value so this is missing only one argument is missing see although we have three arguments three parameters and we are passing only one so it should give missing two but this department is default so it will not give any error only one missing required positional argument right so required arguments are you can say opposite of default arguments those are mandatory or required to provide at the time of function calling if you will not do this thing you will not provide those argument it will give error right now one more important point about this you can just note down this thing about default arguments or what these default arguments should be provided after the known default arguments right see if I provide like uh if I say subject is equal to default value I am providing subject is python and this is I'm not providing any default value for Department one for subject it's python right and Jenny I know I have to pass one name subject is default I have and department so the department I am passing this time CS but still it will be better see the red line let's run this and I'll show you the error syntax error see in line number one only known default argument follows default argument so department is known default argument and it follows the default argument but that is not possible here always the default argument should follow known default argument right means first provide known default argument in the parameter right and then default argument this is not possible Right so if I do something like this name department and subject is equal to python that's fine just provide name because name and Department these are what we are providing Jenny and CS or these are positional argument this this time but if you want to provide keyword then name is equal to Jenny department is equal to DPT is equal to CS that is also fine let's run this and now it will work fine right so this is the point to note here about default arguments and required arguments I have told you now next point is we have arbitrary arguments now suppose some cases are there we have a function let's take another function here rather than this we are taking add function then you will get those arguments arbitrary arguments better we are defining a function like add now I don't know the programmer or like I am the program right now so I don't know how many argument I should pass maybe sometime I want to add only two number two and three and another time I want to add three number then four number then five numbers so every time I'm changing the numbers the number of those numbers right or maybe the number of the parameters or the number of arguments vary every time I call the function so I cannot directly fix like what if you provide two arguments and you just have to do like add maybe two values and just like a plus b and simply x five and seven two numbers okay next time if I want to add three numbers then four numbers and five numbers then if I want to add three numbers five seven nine so it will not work here because let's run this see add takes two position argument but three are given you are giving three argument but it will take only two arguments so it will give error so what you will do maybe I just want to provide next time four argument 10 argument 20 arguments so I don't know in advance like how many arguments I will provide to the set function so here we can provide variable length argument or you can say arbitrary arguments so how can you provide those arguments just a strict sign the star and one variable names so suppose variable name I'm taking a a b c numbers anything you can take right suppose a I am taking or you can say rather than this numbers it should be a meaningful name because many numbers I am providing not just only one so in numbers I am storing those variables right so I'm providing here five seven nine so once you call this ad with 579 means this numbers this will accept 579 and it will become a tuple right like this Tuple is what like this 5 comma 7 comma 9. Now I want to add these three numbers right so just to access each element of this Tuple what we have an equator we have a loop in this I in just the name numbers sorry numbers and then add like C is equal to C Plus hi and then print C okay okay this you have to comment this out five seven nine and at first suppose uh C just set C is equal to zero first so that it will not take any garbage value c means the sum the variable where I'm putting the sum now it will work see sum is 21. next time if I want to add like add and 1 comma 2 comma three comma four comma five like this six numbers so this also will work okay for both sum is 21 so let's provide here one more nine run sum is 21 and this time sum is 30. right so every time we are calling the function we are providing varying number of arguments right so for that we are providing like variable we can use arbitrary argument this is arbitrary argument or you can say variable length argument but here you have to note something this single string there are single asterisk right so single asterisk is used to accept only arbitrary positional arguments see two types we have arbitrary positional argument and arbitrary keyword argument so with single strike this numbers can only accept all the arbitrary you can say positional arguments only not keyword argument right these are C positional argument we are not providing any keyword here just the values we are not associating with this with a with any like name like name is equal to genu department is equal to CS in those cases right so there's a difference so this for the arbitrary positional argument the difference between arbitrary positional argument and arbitrary keyword argument we will be discussing in next video I hope now these Basics are clear to you guys default positional keyword and arbitrary or variable length arguments and when we are using those arguments right the situations so now I'll see in the next video till then bye take care
