so in the series of learning programming in c from this video I'm going to start strengths in C in this video we'll talk about basics of strengths like what is string and how the string is different from character array how to declare a string how to initialize a string different different methods of initializing strings with some example that we'll discuss in this video so now what is string in simple terms if you say in C string is simply array of characters you know what is array right we have discussed array how to say how to declare array and AR data type first of all you will write then we used to write array name and then size of a right array means collection of more than one data items that are of same type right either int or float or C right so now it is array of characters right right means how to declare a string it is array of character so data type must always be a character care the data type would always be a character right in case of string this is I'm know writing what declaration of string so data type always be a character here you cannot write data type because here we cannot write any int or float or anything right in string always the data type would be character we can only store characters right so care here string name any name you can take and here same size you will give size of the string see only difference is in Array we can take any data type int float C right but in string you can only take data type character because string is array of characters right or you can say it is a character array in other words you can also say string is a character array the only difference is what string you can say string is a character array which is ending with a null character whatever I'm saying I'm just going to you know justify this thing so this is I guess clear Declaration of a string right so if I declare a string like care and string name I'm taking generally we take like name and I'm taking size what 10 this is what declaration of a string and you know name of the string is name right name I'm taking only and the size is 10 right so now here see string will always be ended with a null character right if how memory would be allocated to this 10 bytes should be allocated 10 bytes why because character is going to take only one by suppose address is 2000 so Next Bite would be 2001 then 2 then 3 then four and 2009 something like this right so here the name of this is what name I mean the variable the string name I'm taking just name so name and name is containing What Base address of the string that is 2,000 we know array is what array is considered as a internal pointer because it is containing array the name of the array variable is containing Base address of the array or you can say the address of the first element of the array and string is also an array it is array of characters right so obviously the name of this string is also going to contain Base address of the string B Base address of this character array or of the string you can say Base address is 2,000 so here in the name we have 2,000 so it is you can say internal pointer to this string right and index would be same 0 to size minus one 0 to n see now the point the main point is what in this string or in this character array we can only store how many characters nine characters because string would always be ended with a null character so in at the last we always store null character so where you can store Nine characters right or if C so I guess declaration is clear let me store some value now how to initialize this string multiple ways are there one way is while declaring here only we can write what string as we have discussed in previous videos also that starting videos of C programming how we write string something like this in double quotes if I write in double quotes Jenny so this is considered as string if I write Jenny Jenny's lectures this is also a string if I write something like this one 2 3 4 5 in double quotes this is also string right it's not like that I'm saying it's array of characters so you can only uh store A B C D and up to Zed no you can also store a white space uh these numbers because if you write this one 2 3 4 5 in this that is considered as string if you write one in single code that is considered as character if you write two like this this is considered as character if you write space like this is space in single code that that is considered as character so please don't get confused like characters are only a BC D till Z right okay now see and how this data is to be stored here SK values would be stored I guess that you know right the character system that also we have discussed in previous videos you can check out the playlist of C programming and you can check out the previous videos so SK values would be stored so suppose I'm I am storing here something like this J that's it right I'm initializing the string here this is one way of initial initializing a string initialization of a string using string literal we call as string literal Right double quotes J so how it would be stored in this memory j e double n y and at last string would be ended with a null character SK value of null character is zero right so that is uh the difference between string and character array string is is a character array you can you know say it's a character array that is always ended with a null character and why it is ended with null that also we'll discuss the reason also we'll discuss right one by one we'll discuss everything about string uh so now by default compiler will put null at last and here some garbage values right and if I write second way of initializing string is what one way is this second way is you can also write something like this I hope you can see this care name and I'm taking suppose 10 here so how you can initialize j e in characters form J is individual character all are individual characters I'm providing list of characters but here at last explicitly you have to provide SL sorry null character right that is another way of initializing string that is also fine this is how this is what uh that is also stored something like this J and Y and at last you have provided null character that is also fine and remaining would be garbage value right so that is also correct that is also correct but you initialize if you initialize something like this see I'm not providing the size here that is also correct why because you are providing the values this is the string those these values you want in this string in this character array so automatically compiler will uh compiler will do what it will U I'm not getting the exact word y sorry compiler will automatically decide know find out the size and according to that it will store right so how the this is going to be stored the size would be now in this case size would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 like this j e n y and at last null so only what uh six bites to be allocated right no Wast no wastage of space here also you can skip the size because it is what string you are giving right Jenny it is in double quot so that is why it is what a string so same it would be stored like J Jenny and automatically compiler will add what uh null character at last right so by default size would be 1 2 3 4 5 and six so the number of characters plus one that you need to take care size would be that thing number of characters plus one one for null character right now another way of initializing this a string is what and see this is also a string if I write something like this Jenny and with space and then katri this is also string space is also allowed symbols are also like plus minus divide these symbols are also allowed within this string that is also fine I hope you got my point what a string is Right special symbols are also a lot whatever you will write in this double quotes that is considered as string you can write something like this right or you know like welcome to my world that is also string in double quotes that is also fine right so now uh next is see this initialization is what it's I guess similar to one dimensional array right so you can also say string is One D one dimensional AR one dimensional character array right where each you know that element is either a character constant or a string constant right but here the data type must be care and one more thing in C string is not considered as a data type like int float and Care these are data types in C array is also Drive data type and see we also discuss some more data types right structure and Union these are also data types user defined data types right but string is not a data type in C separate data type in C but yeah we can represent string as a character array in C right so here format specifier for string is percentage s right like in for integer percentage D for Lo percentage f for character percentage C for uh string it's percentage s right and this is very important this also some properties of this also we'll discuss one by one right now another way of initializing string is what like I can also write care name and I'm not supposed giving any size here and I'm initializing it something like this V space space is a character so I'm providing list of characters so that is also in single code that is space here V rock that is also perfect so here the size of the string would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 + 1 that is 8 8 how suppose I'm uh know eight like this so index would be 0 to 7 8 bytes should be allocated and here we store V then space Rock and null I guess you got it and this address address would be stored in this uh this name I mean the string name so string name is considered as a pointer pointer to the first character of the string right so we can access the the string using this pointer also and next way is if you declare here so you must declare size what eight if you declare five it is not allowed because size is only five but we are providing values more than five so that is not allowed size would be number of characters plus one right now 10 is fine right remaining would be any garbage value another way of initializing string is see if you want to initialize like this scare name and I'm providing sizes 10 and in next line I want to write name 10 is equal to j e n y j this is not allowed we cannot separate this out Declaration and initialization that would be in same line so this would give an error this is not allowed in see right uh next is if you want to do something like this like name 10 and this is what Jenny and I'm writing sorry care care and uh suppose I'm writing S1 same size is 10 and I want to initialize this S1 equal to name because this is also string this is also string I want to copy the whatever in this string that is Jenny into S1 I want to write this thing so that is also not allowed see here S1 is what it's like array name so we cannot put any array name to the left side of this equal to operate have to read a string or you can have to initialize a string at run time so here in this case we are having what we use in array using scanf like for Loop and scanf use atun time initialization but here we use scanf also we can also use gets function we can also use get character two to three types of function we can use so that we'll discuss in next video because we have some drawbacks of scanner function that's why we use get as function also we have some drawbacks of get as function so that everything we'll discuss in next video with the proper example and that example also I'll show you practically on my laptop right so now some questions on string for you is I guess you got the basics of string only right I mean what is a string and some declaration and initialization like uh compile time initialization of string and some points important points about string I hope you got everything right so now you have to tell me in comment box like these are valid or not this initialization of string and if there's any error you can tell me what is the error or here you have to tell me the size because I'm not giving any size what size will be you know determined by the compiler automatically in this case and in this case right so this is assignment for you so now and the next video will discuss next part of our string like how to read a string how to print a string everything about string with some examples and I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
