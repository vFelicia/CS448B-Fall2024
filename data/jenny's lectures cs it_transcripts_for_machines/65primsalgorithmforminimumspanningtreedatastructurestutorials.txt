hi guys welcome back and in this video I'm going to discuss with you prims algorithm which is used to find out minimum spanning tree okay we have already discussed close schools algorithm in the last video so please grab my deck here though we do have the exact and in this video I'm going to discuss video how to find out minimum spanning tree from a given graph using prims algorithm ok I'll discuss this algorithm step by step see suppose this one is our graph fine and we will now apply prims algorithm so first step in prims algorithm is what first of all remove all the loops and parallel edges fine loops means in case one edge start from the same vertex and it's coming to the same vertex only incoming and outgoing to the same vertex that is known as loop the first of all you will remove all the loops see in this graph we have only one loop so remove this one fine no need to check its coast although it is having that edge cost or weight one that is minimum but that doesn't matter you have to remove that loop okay now the next step remove parallel edges in this graph parallel edges are see from this vertex to this vertex you have two edges which are parallel fine so these type of edges are known as parallel edges it may be parallel edges only from this graph you have to remove those also two in this graph we have only one parallel edge see this one two two parallel edges so which one you have to remove now see just check out the edge weight one is six and one is eight so you are supposed to keep that edge which is having minimum weight or minimum cost so that is six I'm is 6ko you will keep this edge and you will remove this one eight that would be removed finds all the loops and paralyzes edges have have been removed so next step is now see choose any are what takes as a root note in crew skills algorithm what we have been is up Nikki Akata arranged Piatra all the edges according to their increasing weight but in prims algorithm it is not the step prims algorithm Akaka now you can choose any vertex with me how many educators katha having minimum weight is macaca okay you will choose any arbitrary node as a root node suppose we are choosing this e okay we are going to start to draw MST from this e so you have chosen this e as a root node fine now next step is what check out all the outgoing edges from this node whatever know whatever node you have chosen you are supposed to check out all the outgoing edges from or you can say the incident edges from this node outgoing incoming kaku Cheney because we do not have the directed edges I mean directed graph happen a pastor you are supposed to check the incident edges from this node see two edges are there one is 78 fine now what you have to choose is you have to choose one edge that is having minimum weight so out of seven and eight you will choose this seven find happening so choose curlier that is seven or thi go to the vertex me fine now next task is what now see you have reached to this be fine now you have to choose all the outgoing edges or you can say the incident edges from B as well as from a a akanesan yet you have reached to be top B key edges of checker baby keep it near just happy incident to our outgoing you can see this 3 and this six but still a k possibly one more edges there that is it up boys kobe compare khanna it's gonna cool job a assign Ikaruga be paper to the observe you though a disco checkered oven miss a minimum home via couscous kuruvi no that is the you know most commonly mistake that students do but yeah ponycorn I have so BC up key incident edges concurrency here one is six and one is three and from a also we have one one hum net select early has still we have one that is 8 2 out of 8 3 and 6 which one is having minimum weight this 3 but will you will choose this one 3c and 3 fine edges up nature's curry now see we have three vertex C word thistles in this MST a B and C now check all the incident or you can say outgoing edges from this B also see also and a also and you will choose that one which is having minimum weight si si si Hamada pass edges con con C happy this one 3 this one for two we have but still baekje one as one edges left that is six a pisco be compare kuruvi or a k up capacity high eight out of eight six three and four which edges having minimum weight that is this one 3c they will choose this one c e and weight is three fine now next step is one check out all the outgoing edges from this one also this also this also and this also fine now e from e what are the incident edges are outgoing edges that is this one this one and this one having two into yagna twos korea having as you add two and two fine seek in america signature that is for big is tell you how one incident edge because one hum to is cuts between six or a coupla pascal eight out of eight six this two this two and this for how many edges 8 6 4 2 n 2 in subcode check karna high and which is having minimum weight 2 and to both the edges having minimum weight so you can choose anyone suppose you have choose this f how many laylee ahead do now check we have one another vertex still one vertex is left that is not as this spanning tree so now choose which or Texas having minimum weight C from F we have only one outgoing vertex left or you can say incident what take the incident edge left that is five because how many Jews Kurt okay him do this five has been left so it's not like a FF paper today whether you will choose this five and our player mr. Tucker diya no that is wrong what you have to do is if say five fair but II EC incident edges had two three and two three has been chosen to has been chosen one this to has been left so this five this two from see we have this four from D one is left that is six from a one is left that is eight out of eight six four two and five which s is having minimum weight that is two so you will choose this one e2 and this will go to be fine this has been chosen so this is the minimum spanning tree of this graph using prims algorithm see I have told you the algorithm step by step now you can check out our verify carnalito minimum spanning tree or trigger you can see a spanning tree spanning tree of any graph would contain the same number of vertices as that graph contains how many vertices are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 fine 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 vertices are there and how many number of edges would this spanning tree contains the edges would be subset of the edges that this graph contains suppose this graph is I know I hope you know how to represent a graph G V and E the number of vertices a number of edges suppose G Dash is this spanning tree having vertices V and he then what are the conditions we should equal to this we all the vertices should be same and this e should be subset of this fine and he yup key number of edges I a kidney only up keep us he should be but you can say this II II should be n minus one and he let him have Amelia heavy we means number of what Tessa's in this original draft a disk up misty find out Korean that graph ticket V minus one it needs may number of edges only to see in this case how many we are there one two three four five six six vertices the number of edges in spanning tree or you can say minimum spanning tree would be 6 minus 1 that is 5 for kidney edges have one two three four five fine minimum spanning tree one more condition is marriage a geeky the total edge weight of these edges should be minimum see this graph can have more than one spanning trees take a spanning tree ski both sorry or something but minimum spanning tree one condition cared very aptly spanning prejob e38 hygge obscure total edge weight the about Bosco total croquet that should be minimum that is known as minimum spanning tree so this is the prims algorithm so in next video I discuss I will discuss the properties of minimum spanning tree till then byebye take
