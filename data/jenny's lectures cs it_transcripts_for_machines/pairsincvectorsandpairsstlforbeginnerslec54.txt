hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing standard template libraria like vectors we have discussed till now right same like vector we have pair in STL right so we'll discuss in this video what is pair why we use it how to use it some member function of pair and uh declaration initialization of pair and all everything about pair we will discuss in this video okay what is a pair first of all we'll discuss what is a pair in this standard template Library so see in general uh meaning if I say like a pair of uh marker I have a pair of marker like I have two marker pair means like two things okay pair of shoes pair of jeans pair of shirt like this right you understand the general meaning of a PA the spare set of two values or two things right I can say see uh this is a pair or not like this is a pair or not I have one is ink and one is marker yes it is a pair although the things I have are not same they are different type but still it is a pair right so a pair it combines we can say it combines like two values right and that values can be of same type or different type right I hope you got what is a pair right so in your term you can write down proper definition of pair right or not I'll it's okay I'll tell you proper definition also but first let's understand this pair okay so now so in STL in standard template Library like vector is a container I have told you or we can say it was a class so same pair is also a container in STL or we can also say pair is a class so we can create object of this class we can create pairs right so whenever you are going to create pair that are known as you can say object of pair class right so let's see the syntax first how you will write write down how you will declare a pair we simply write pair in small letter and here we write data type data type 1 and data type 2 because it is a set of two values or two elements of same type or maybe of different type we can say of potential different types right and here we just write down the pair name that's it this is simple declaration or you can say uh this is how we are going to define a pair this is data type of first element data type of second element right like if I write pair first int next is string and pair name I'm just taking P so we have a object pair of object P right which can contain two values of intent string type and this is first this is second right and the order is fixed the first how you can access this thing this Value First value we just write down the name of the pair Dot and first so whatever value you will store here that it will give you that thing and P do second it will give you that thing so order is fixed first second right these are keyword first and second this is how we are going to access this thing so I'll show you this thing with the help of program right now why we need this thing a pair see whenever you want to uh store whenever you want to return from a function two values so we can use in that case pair right or if you want to store a pair of you know related values we can use this thing like d we use dictionary we use tle the header file for this pair is utility we use utility header we can we can see it is a container class which is defined in standard template Library pair provides you a way to store two heterogeneous type of object as a single unit as a single object right now how to use this let me just show you this thing with some you know uh practically with some programs okay so let's create a new file we have pair to do CPP right so let's include what first headers I use stream and if you're using pair let's include utility header and namespace STD okay now first we are going to create a pair right so just write down this pair see template this is a class right so let's write down this spare and here you have to write down see type name T1 type name T2 this holding two object of arbitrary type so first let's take int and Float right now name of the pair I'm taking P that's it right now how we are going to initialize this pair the values one is directly here we can write down the initializer list that is also find like in these brackets we can simply write down the first as int so first write down some value like 23 in then float so I'm writing something like this okay it should be like point right so I have given two values 23 and this intent float so this is how one way to initialize a pair now how to access these values we have two key first and second so how to access if you want to access the the first value then name of the pair followed by dot operator and then first right then let's put some space and then P dot second right andle let's run this and see what output you will get let's run this and see you are getting 20 3 5689 right so this is how you can access the values now this is one way of initial initialization of this pair second way is we can initialize this we can uh use something like this rather than initializing here we can do what let's create another pair having int and string two values and name of the pair is P2 let's take this one as P1 right so should be P1 P1 P2 we have a function make pair right using that also we can initialize these things like I can do something like this I have created this thing now P2 equal to I can just call this function uh make pair right and here I can give the value like 12 comma and string like any name I'm giving J something like this and same if you want to print then we can use here P2 do first name of this is because P2 and this is also P2 rather than this let's comment out this thing and I'm just going to print the values of second Vector 12 and J right now make pair is a function see make pair is a function here you can create a pair without explicitly you know telling these data types intent string but how here I have used this make function to initialize P2 this is also fine but here I have given these uh data types explicitly but if you don't want to give this thing that also uh there is also one way using make pair function what is that way see I'm going to create another pair P3 suppose so P3 equal to it's not correct I'm going to uh do some correction here P3 equal to just call uh this this uh what we can say make PA function and give some values suppose I'm giving here not Jenny let's take like Rahul now don't comment out this thing like I'm wondering who is Rahul Rahul is just a name or we can say a student right do not try to find out any relationship with me Rahul comma any like I'm giving 89 or R this thing right but it see identify P3 is undefined right so here just tie down Auto this keyword so it will automatically take these uh data types first is string second is character right and it will create a pair P3 so if you want to print this P3 let's just comment out this thing and P3 do first and P3 do 2 let's comment out this line and now run this and what it should give Rahul and R see Rahul and R right so without explicitly specifying uh these data types we can use make pair function to create a pair okay we can use another a pair to initialize another pair okay this is how see we can do this thing uh we have three pair P1 P2 P3 so let's create another pair I have a pair if you want to initialize suppose P4 pair with the same values of P1 right so the type would be same int float and in the same order right so let's just copy paste this thing and pair I'm just taking pair int float and P4 P4 and in bracket P1 I want to initialize P4 with P1 so P4 and P1 PA are having same value now so let's just print what P4 values P4 do first and P4 do 2 and it should print 23 and this 5689 C same values so using another pair also we can initialize a pair so there are some ways different different ways of you know initializing a pair creating a pair and direct with direct assignment also possible like let's let's create another pair so I have another pair Bo comma string two types I have and P6 so we can do direct assignment like P6 equal to what we can do sorry P P6 DOT first equal to Bull so either zero or one or true or false right I don't know it will take true or false the keyword but let's see let's try out true right and P6 do second is equal to string so I'm just uh writing here like uh anit right and semicolon so if you want to print these values why P6 it should be P5 right because till P4 we have created pair now so why get P5 let's take P5 so we are going to now print P5 and here also P5 this is direct assignment we are directly assigning the values to first and second element I don't know it will work or not let's run one and the name anit so one like true is one okay false or true so automatically it will decode it to um one so this is also possible now one more thing with this is this is what member function of pair memor function of obviously I have told you pair is a class so in that we are having some mem function and those mem function we can use with pair object so we have one more function mem function that is swap if you want to swap the values of two pair pair object we can use swap function let's see that thing also suppose I have but keep this thing in your mind if you want to swap the content of two pair P1 and P2 so the data type should be same right of first and second element right because P1 do first would be swapped with P2 do first P2 P1 do2 would be swapped with P2 do2 so the data type should be same I don't know if you will take different datae it will work or not let's try out this thing also because I'm trying out this thing first time right now so let's run we have P1 and P2 okay let's swap these thing so how uh let's just first comment out all the other things sorry we have a swap function so on P1 I'm just going to call the swap function and in bracket let's pass P2 okay sorry and semicolon now after swapping let's print P1 and P2 only P1 and P2 these two things I don't know it will work or not okay it will give definitely it will give an error see the red line here okay see here's no matching function for call to pair swap because here we have in in but here we have float and string so we cannot swap float with string so here it should be same let's do this let's convert this float to string or take this string here and here let's take what let's take pile now swap P1 and P2 it will work now see 12 Jenny 23 pile so let's do one thing first print before swapping content of P1 and P2 and then after swapping and before swapping let's print and after that call this swap function right and then we print this thing right so before swapping you know P1 23 pile P2 12 J okay so before swapping 23 pile 12 J after swapping 12 jny and 23 P so I mean the values has been swapped right so this is how we can use swap function on pair right and one more thing I just want to tell you if you not initialize the pair suppose uh this we have a pair P5 and we haven't initialized this thing and I want to print P5 values I haven't initialized anything and I want to print the Valu so it will print what wol and string I don't know let's run and see see one only zero it is printing right so by default automatically it will be initialized if you take int then it would print zero if you take string then nothing would be printed because it is null character nothing would be printed because it is null bull yeah it's type of zero or one so it will like zero would be initialized so it will print zero if I take here rather than Bool and string let me just show you here I'm taking int and Float right and let's just comment out remaining things I'm just printing values of P5 see it will print 0 0 because int it will by default initialize this to 0 0 if I have one as string one is string so string would be nothing would be printed in at the place of string because it would be null only one zero would be printed see Z second zero right so by default it will be initialized automatically by null or zero right next we can use comparison operator on these pairs also two pairs if you want to compare like P1 equal to P2 or less than equal to greater than equal to and these kind of thing that is also fine let me just show you something but for that also you have you should have this this know same data type I have same thing in string in string and P2 is this so let's compare these things simply the name of the pair P1 and P P2 so here I'm uh checking for equality P1 equal equal to P2 so it will you know compare this first with first second with second and obviously this is not equal so it should give what let's comment out this line false means zero so output should be zero I guess yeah it is zero right or not equal to less than equal to greater than equal to these things we can do so it is your assignment you have to try out the these things all the those operators comparison operators relational operators on these pairs right if I if I take here rather than uh int if I take here float then what will happen let's see 12.34 in this case see the red line no operator matches these operant so because it will compare this this first operand of pair one with the first of pair two but both are of different a type so it will give error right so it should be it should be here int so please try out all these relational operators not equal to less than equal to less than greater than equal to greater than on these pairs right P1 and P2 it is your assignment and you can just write down that thing in common section right I hope now pair is clear to you guys like what are pairs why we use these pairs understand how to use these these things right so now you have idea of vectors and pairs right so in the next video we'll see Vector of pairs right so now I'll see you in the next Tut bye take care
