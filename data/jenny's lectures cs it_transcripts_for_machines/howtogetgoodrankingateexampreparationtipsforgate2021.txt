toppers are also normal person they are also human beings do not think that they have some extraordinary which you don't have only thing which they have and i guess you may not have is what dedication hard work and a smart strategy for anything these three things are very important so i guess if you are preparing for gate exam then obviously you have that dedication that you want to clear gate exam you want to crack gate exam with good rank just you need is what how to prepare smartly for that exam have to work hard smartly yeah you can do hard work but you have to add one more thing in you know that plan and that what is smartly right so in this video we are going to discuss those tips like how you can prepare smartly how you should prepare the subjects to get a very good drink or maybe only india rank one but before that just want to tell you one thing for gate aspirants and academy has started a test series for the most expected questions for gate 2021 and it cons the series consists of three tests two tests has already been conducted and one test is on 28th of november of the subjects programming data structure algorithms operating system and discrete mathematics this test has been designed to provide you the most expected questions that can be asked in gate 2021 and these tests has been curated and reviewed by the most experienced educators at an academy the test will have 30 question and the time limit would be 90 minutes so you can attend you can take the live test and if you take the live test then all india ranking would be provided to you and you can win some exciting prices some rewards the details of these rewards would be given over here you can check out but it's okay if you are not able to attend the live test you can also write the test after the live test is over and the test would be in english and the test is free if you want to take this test you don't need to pay anything it is completely free you just need to enroll so the all the details and the enrollment link i'll give you in the description box of this video if you are interested you can check out so now let us discuss how to secure a very good rank in gate 2021 first step is firstly prepare focus on those subject which are having higher weight is maximum weightage and gait examination like from those those subject from which they ask maximum number of question some from some subjects usually they ask one or two questions three or four question from some subjects five to six and sometimes six to seven questions as well right so focus on those subject first thoroughly prepare those subjects and how you can come to know those subjects obviously you have to analyze previous year question papers last 15 years question paper just take those question paper analyze them and just write down from which subject how many questions usually they ask every year so in gate we have three sections ft mathematics for computer science and subject specific section for computer science the subjects are these are the subjects so you have to prepare smartly see from coa generally three or maybe two to three question they ask and those questions are very tricky this is my personal experience whatever i have observed like many students are not able to you know give answer correctly for the question for the subjects you a subject so rather than focusing on the subject more you have to focus on the subjects like from algorithm programming and data structure generally they ask five to six question sometimes from toc they ask six to seven question sometimes so rather than firstly focusing on the subject focus on these subjects which are having higher weightage right as well as one more drawback drawback is what the questions are very tricky of co equations are very tricky and the question which are asked from these subjects those are not that much tricky if you have very well well prepared the subjects you can easily answer all the questions right i'm not saying that leave the subject right if you are maybe you are competing for all india rank one so it's not a good idea to leave any subject obviously if you are you know competing for for all india rank one then you must have prepared your you must have started your preparation one year ago or maybe in third year so you have enough time and you can prepare all the subjects like if you have suppose less time five to six months or maybe three or four months sometimes and you just want to crack get exam at that time maybe you can leave some subject like see where you can leave but your aim is all endearing one or maybe within 50 or 100 or linear rank then you must prepare all the subject but firstly prepare these subjects right second thing is what find out your strength your strong points maybe suppose you have prepared five or six subjects and you are left with suppose coa and maybe cn or digital logic right you have prepared all the subject these subject very well so now out of these suppose you are very good in computer network or maybe you are good in computer network so you should go first for this subject if you are good in digital logic you should go first for that subject see approximately 50 marks questions comes from four to five subjects sometimes maybe five to six subjects and that is true right so if you have prepared those five or six subjects very well like you can solve any question from those subjects so that is very good for you and for the remaining subjects what you can do see it's not like that every topic is important some topics are very important like co is very hard for you suppose right fine and tricky question generally they ask tricky question from that so you can observe previous your question paper like from which topic generally they ask question they ask question every time so prepare those the most important topics rather than preparing the complete you know unit or complete subject the whole subject you can do this thing if you have less time if you have enough time then you can prepare all the topics of that subject also but rather than focusing on these subjects the less weighted subject right and in which you are not sure you are not very much interested after preparing the main subjects five six or maybe seven subjects just go for the test series subject wise test you have to give this thing is very important subject wise as well as after preparation like in previous video also i have told you in december and january go for full length mock test but after preparing like algorithm you should go for subjectwise test series means for algorithm the test series attend or take that test analyze your mistakes whatever you have done wrongly and you know which type of questions you are not able to solve which type of questions can be asked when you take tests then you will come to know which type of questions can be asked in gate examination the pattern right so the more test you will write the more you practice the more you will get better at that thing at that subject so this thing is also very important first of all subjectwise test then at last in last two months full length mock test as well as solve previous year question paper gate question paper isro as well as tifr so that you will come to know this type of question can be asked the pattern so if you want to secure a very good rank all india rank these two points are very very very important i think if you haven't prepared any subject very well like thoroughly and if you have started solving previous gate question paper that is also fine because if you got stuck somewhere in any question of that subject then at that time you can read that topic from any book or whatever study material you have right this thing is very important you should start this solving previous year gate question paper role taking the mock test and everything as early as possible do not just wait that first of all i'll prepare all the subjects very well then only i'll start solving previous year question papers or isro question paper so or that mock test do not wait for this thing start as early as possible right next thing which is very very very important is what see sometimes the question is very easy but you do not remember the formula gate examination is what basically based on formulas less theoretical part they ask less theoretical type of question they ask they more focus on computation part right so if you do not remember the formula then you are not able to solve that question and the question is very easy maybe the formula is in your mind but exactly you don't remember sometimes maybe low base 2 or low waste 10 this kind of silly things you don't remember so what you have to do you have to make a separate notebook for just formulas for each unit of each subjects or maybe if you know the short trick or solving any question or for any topic then also you can write that in this notebook so that you can revise those formulas in that tips and tricks those short tricks may be on the day of exam or one day or two day before exam you don't need to you know flip all the pages of your notes that those lengthy notes these are short notes handy notes right so this thing is also very important and see in the important subjects as well there are important topics from which every year they ask question so first focus on those topics or you can say specially focus on those topics so put your hard work in right direction it doesn't matter that you have prepared all the subjects what thing which matter is what how well you have prepared those subjects which are having higher weightage from which they ask question every time maximum number of question has been asked it's not like that one subject is there from which hardly one or two or two to three questions they ask and those are very tricky like coa and you have devoted firstly you you start preparing coa and you have devoted almost maybe 15 days one month for this subject and when you have started solving problems of this subject see you a subject suppose so and you are not able to solve those questions yeah they are tricky and you feel what demotivated like you have prepared the subject but you are not able to solve question so you will feel demotivated so rather than doing this thing focus on important subject first and the subjects which are easy like i think this programming data structure algorithm these subjects are easy maybe toc and compiler design are a little bit tough but maybe for some students toc is very easy and maybe algorithms are different it depends on the past person to person students to student but with the preparation you have to take care of some points while attempting gate examination that thing is also very important preparation plus how you attempt that exam on your final day so that thing how to attempt gate exam in the best way that thing will discuss in next video so now i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
