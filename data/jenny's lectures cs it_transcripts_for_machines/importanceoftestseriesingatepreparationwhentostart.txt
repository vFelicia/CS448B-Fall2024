can go and check out so let us discuss why test series are so important and when to start test series see many students don't start test series why so they say that their preparation is still going on they are not done with their preparation after that they'll start taking test series so it is not the right time to start after completing your preparation like maybe in december or january you should start taking test series you should start taking that subject wise test or maybe mock test as soon as possible obviously you can't take full length mock test before your preparation but suppose if you have prepared six or seven subjects then also then at the right it is the right time to start full length mock test but subject wise uh test when you can start once you have completed your subject then start taking ah start you can start taking the subject wise mock test for that subject right do not wait till your preparation is over because see preparation is nowhere is never going to end and many students don't go for test series because of some fear like if they will not score very well in test series at that time what will happen they have this fear see take it as a good point if you start taking the test series definitely you will come to know your weak points if you have prepared very well right you think that i have prepared six or seven subjects i have prepared suppose one subject very well right so better it's time to test your knowledge it's time to test your concepts whether yeah you have knowledge you have prepared very well but whether you are able to solve question from that subject see knowledge is different thing it doesn't mean you have knowledge you have prepared suppose 10 subjects very well right you have very good conceptual knowledge but one thing which is very important is what how you attempt your exam on the final day it doesn't mean one has prepared all the ten subjects and definitely he is going to get a very good rank no maybe one student has prepared only eight subjects and he is going to be only india anchor means stopper so accuracy matters a lot and speed also matters a lot at that time and when your accuracy or speed comes with practice so definitely you should practice by giving some test series a mock test right only one test series is sufficient if you want to go for more test then two not more than two two test series are more than enough or maybe one is also sufficient right because you have to analyze test series also that thing will discuss in next video so first point is by taking test series by giving that mock test you will come to know where you are standing in the competition and take it as a healthy competition means don't feel demotivated if you don't score very well in test series it's fine it happens with everyone after taking 15 20 30 40 tests your score will definitely increase so it's fine if in first test or second or third or till maybe five four ten tests you are scoring very well like maybe around 30 or maybe 25 30 35 like this that is fine you have to identify your area of improvement and definitely you have to work hard on your weaknesses that thing also will discuss so this is very first point second thing is if you take test series if you take subject wise test or full length test then you will come to know the variety of questions they ask means suppose if you are good at very in any subject or in any topic or in any concept you are very good you have practiced many questions as well but baby sometimes in gate they ask tricky questions or different type of questions and you are not able to solve that question in gate exam so it is a negative point for you although you have prepared that subject or that topic or that concept you are very good at that but still you are not able to solve question so face these type of questions different different type of question before actual exam that is a good approach so that while attempting the actual exam if this type of question comes then you can solve that question right next is definitely it is going to help you obviously in your revision and um your brushing up the concepts because when you take the test series if you are not able to attempt any question then definitely you will see why you are not able to attempt that question the topic and you will revise that topic again so it is a good approach to revise fourth point is what you will come to know your strong points as well as your weak points means strong points means the subjects in which you are performing very well in which you are good you are able to solve question and quickly as well and those subjects in which you are not good or maybe some concepts or some topics from which you are not able to attempt question so once you come to know that in these subjects or in these concepts in these topics you are weak you can work according to that you can work hard on that topics next you will come to know your silly mistakes silly mistakes like maybe when you are noting dying noting down the information given in the question that is wrong or sometimes you remember the formula but you use some different sign like maybe plus minus or divide or into something like this different wrong sign in that formula or maybe sometimes while marking you have got the answer but while marking that answer you mark it wrongly or you don't you don't check the unit of the answer these are some silly mistakes see these silly mistakes occurs in which a question easy question means you know how to solve that question you can solve that question easily but because of silly mistakes you lose marks and that is where you lack your lacking behind because in gate even one mark can make a huge difference in your ring so while taking test series you will come to know if you are doing some silly mistakes so you can analyze your silly mistakes and you can work on those mistakes right next is it will help you to find out the best attempting strategy for you like it doesn't mean that one youtuber is saying follow this strategy while attempting that question paper your friend is saying this strategy you should follow you will get maximum marks no strategy at last ultimately would be yours only so you can practice all the strategies like first i'll solve two numbers uh two marks technical question or first i'll show general amplitude or maybe some students uh start from sequentially like 1 to 65 question so you can practice all the strategies while taking test series full length test and you can find out which one is best for you next very important thing is it will teach you how to manage time because when you take a full length test then obviously that would be a proper gate type environment 65 question 180 minutes and see yeah one more important thing you should use virtual calculator and that scribble pad at the time when you are taking test series you should create that proper gate type of environment like you are sitting in your actual exam so it will teach you time management you will come to know while solving which type of questions you are taking too much time or which type of question you can solve quickly so according to that you can practice suppose if you have a poor time management you are not able to attempt question at least 55 questions or 60 question then you have a poor time management you have to work on that on these things you have to practice you have to increase your speed right and you will come to know how to handle how to tackle that exam pressure because if you take test series full length mock test then you will be habitual of facing that exam whole environment you will will be habitual of using virtual calculator schedule scribble pad for uh rough work and you will be habitual of you know managing time like 65 question i have to attempt in 180 minutes so when you enter in the examination examination hold on your final day then you will not feel nervous because sometimes it happens if you don't know the strategy to attempt the exam if you don't don't know how to manage time at that time if you don't know how to use virtual calculator at that time yeah your preparation is very well right but still you are not able to get a good rank because of pressure and that nervousness so that is why test series are very important and start taking test series as soon as possible don't wait till you know your exam your preparation is over so that's it for this video now in next video i'm going to discuss how to analyze test series so i'll see in the next video till then bye
