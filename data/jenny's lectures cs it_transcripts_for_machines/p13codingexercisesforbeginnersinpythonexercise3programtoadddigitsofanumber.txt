so in the series of learning python programming language the previous video we have discussed type conversion or you can say type casting have to convert one type to another type with help of an example we have seen now till now what we have discussed based on that i am going to give you one coding exercise right and that is you have to write down a program to add digits of a number or more specifically i say we will take a two digit number and you have to add those two digits of that number for example if you give input it should ask enter a number or enter a two digit number and i'm entering uh suppose to l so the output should be 3 means it should add 1 plus 2 these two digits if a number is like 23 the output should be 3 plus 2 is equal to 5 this should be input this should be output this should be input this should be out i hope you got my point okay now don't panic you don't have to go and search and google like how to add digit software number and use the logic like modulo operator or divide operator find out the digits of a number and all no no no no let me just give you hint see basically you have using input function you will take input from the user you know okay so now you know about input function the properties of input input function the strings and main thing what you need to do here is i have told you you can access like suppose i am writing gen so you can access individual character of a string using subscript like this is jenny this is string and i'm just putting here subscript 0 it means it will give you j if i write here 1 it will give you e something like this this we have discussed so this concept you have to apply and type conversion only type casting or type conversion this is a little hint for you guys now just pause the video and try this out and after that we will see the solution so let's i hope you have done this let's see the solution let's create a new file and i'm just going to name it exercise 2 dot py so now from user you have to input the you have to take the input so we'll for that you have to use input function so input and the prompt message enter a two digit number okay only two digit we are taking so whatever you will enter that obviously will store into a variable so you can take any variable like number number or a two underscore digit underscore number more meaningful name you can take i'm taking number so we have a 2 digit number now like we have 12 1 2 so this 12 this number is what it's a string okay let's run this program and i'll show you let's run this right click and run exercise two so it will ask enter a two digit number and whatever you will enter that number that would be by default this input function will return this 12 would be considered as string it is not a number and as we know string subscripting is a concept where you can access each character of a string so you can access one you can access two individually so that's it so just access these i'm accessing how to access name of the this string or you can say the variable image number and 0 so it will give you 1. so store this into another variable suppose i am writing first digit first digit i am taking a variable name and one is second digit equal to sorry it's not double equal to its assignment operator is equal to number and subscript one so subscript zero here this in this point of time we have one so one would be stored in first digit and two would be stored in second digit now maybe you will print something like this print and obviously some is what first digit sorry and plus this second digit okay so it should give you some let's run this and see what you will get so let's run this enter a 2 digit number i am entering 1 2 still it it will give you 12 only because yeah you have fetched individual digits like 1 is in first digit now two is in second is it now but these are still strings you haven't converted these into integer and you are concatenating these two now so basically it will do plus is do concatenation of these two strings one and two one plus two it will give you 12 only so the solution is convert these into integer now how to convert basically you can write here int okay and here also end sorry and in bracket second is it okay or maybe you can something like you can write something like this int first it is it you can convert it and save it into another variable like new first digit and after converting you can save it into new second digit and after that in printf simply you can write new first digit plus new second digit second you know method or you can say way of writing can be there but here in print only i am writing i am converting and i am just you know adding these numbers so let's run this and 12 at this time it will give you 3. let's run this again for any number suppose i am entering 45 it will give you 9 i hope you got the solution okay so before see checking the solution please i guess you have tried it out and try it out and whatever if you have tried it out let's write down your code in comment section whatever you have written that code okay not my code be honest so i hope you got the solution of this exercise how to write down a program to add i know deserts of a twodigit number so now the next video will see some operators in python so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
