hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning path and programming language till now we have uh covered few things in ttal graphics few methods and all in previous two videos So based on that we'll be discussing one coding exercise in this video right now what you have to do you have to draw a dashed line like this this type of dashed line you have to draw right so I don't know how much long line you will draw but definitely this would be this much long at least right so see for this I have also you know discussed in the previous video what what method you are going to use so you can watch the previous video first if you don't know how to draw this line and definitely when you watch the previous video definitely will get the methods and it would be very easy to draw after that this line right so pause the video and try this out let's create a new file here so it will give me importing from Turtle specifically I'm going to import Turtle class and then let's create a turtle like to is equal to okay third name of the classes with capital D Turtle right and let's create a screen as well object screen object suppose S1 equal to we have a class screen for that you have to import that class as well from Turtle module so here here we have screen with capital S right so total and this we have now what we can do draw a line to like maybe 10 pixel then no line then again a line of 10 pixel then no line like this so here we can use what methods pen up and Pen down right so first draw move your turtle to forward Direction suppose 10 pixels right then pen up pen up after pen up just move the circle uh the startle again forward to 10 pixels and then pen down and after pen down again move this to forward in forward direction to 10 pixel like this pen up pen down and draw right if I S1 dot suppose first exit on click let's call this also so if I run this thing let's run this see one 10 pixel then no pixel and like this so yeah you have to just use these lines again and again right so this line forward then again contrl C and just control V again I'm going to paste these lines again I'm going to paste these line three or four times again these lines let's run this see this much line you got but rather than writing or copy pasting the same line again and again yeah we have Loop kind of thing right we can use for Loop so just remove these lines because these four lines we are repeating again and again move forward then pen up then move forward pen down again move forward so you can put these line in a four Loop like four in range suppose I'm taking range 10 right and obviously this would be indented so rather than this Dash you can write down any variable as well like for I in range but Dash or this this sorry not Dash It's underscore UND means I don't care about the values whatever the values is I just want to run whatever is there in this Loop 10 times that's it I don't care about the values so just write down underscore or any variable you can also take x y z count a b c anything I that is also fine right so let's run this now see you can see a dash line here right so this is one way but I'm not saying that this is the only way to draw a dash line there can be another way multiple ways also like maybe when see while drawing this line for 10 pixel the pen color is black for again 10 pixel the pen color is white you can change the pen color then again change the pen color to Black then white black white black white for tend in pixels we know you can change the pen color right we have a method pen color just in bracket you have to give the color string one time black one time white that's it or you don't have to give even black because that is by default but obviously when you are changing the color to white then you have to change that to black as well right so black and white black and white this thing you need to get so with second method you just try this out right you try out both the methods with this also pen up and down with black and white changing of the color in that also same four lines would be repeated and just put those lines into this for Loop this kind of for Loop right it's not like that you have to take 10 only you can take here 50 so that would be a little bit long line like this right I hope now you got this this time this this thing so please let me know in comment section that thing like how to draw the stash line with the the changing of the color black black white black white just write on the logic only the four lines right so now in the next video we'll draw few more shapes complex type of shapes right so now I'll see you in the next Tut then byebye take care
