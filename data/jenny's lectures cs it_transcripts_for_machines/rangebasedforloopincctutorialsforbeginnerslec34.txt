hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing Loops in C plus plus we have discussed four while and do while loop now one is linked that is range Base Four Loop so everything about this Loop we'll be discussing in this video and it was basically introduced in the version C plus plus 11 before that it was not there in C plus plus it is similar like orange Loop in Java and we also our range base for looking python that we have already discussed uh in that python series so now what is the strange based four five we use this how this is different from that additional code loop and the advantages of using this the benefits or the drawbacks everything we'll be discussing about this range based for Loop in this video with the help of program practical also I'll show you right but before that just want to tell you something important for those especially who are interested to make their career other full

for Loop till 10. right if I say one to five means one two three four five it is a range from one to five range or you can say just a collection or a container collection of elements right or we can say in programming language we can say if I write something like this it's an array array is what although in C plus we haven't discussed error in detail we'll be discussing but I hope you have a basic idea about array if you have gone through those C programming videos so array is what a collection of similar homogeneous data type right so all the elements are a happy data type in data type so it is a collection so simply it is in you can say an array or you can say a vector or list is also a collection or you can say it's a sequence so range based form means this for Loop is basically work on the Range specifically on the Range or you can say on collections or on arrays on vectors on list on strings because these are sequence of elements specifically on collections this type of for Loop would be used now why and what is the advantage let me show you so see first of all let me just show you the syntax of this phone simply will write down this four and here we will write down range declaration so this is the general syntax of range base for Loop in this four Loop we are having only two things one is range declaration column then expression now what is this I'll show you and in this body of the loop we have some statements so this Loop will execute these statements repeatedly and sequentially if there are multiple statements so in a sequence they'll be executed so the two will execute these statements repeatedly and sequentially for each element in this expression range expression for each element right so means in this expression it's like when say it's a collection or it is a range multiple elements it is having right okay let's take one example I am having in simple array in type array suppose a and I am having here one two three elements only so it is what arrange till one two three or you can say a collection or a list or an array or you can say it's a container or a sequence of elements right now how to apply this four range declaration means declare a variable and this variable data type should be of same as these this this container data type or this collection data type or this array data type this is what in so it should be in any variable name you can take x y z a b c d anything so let's take B but it should be different from this one this name then column and then range expression the name of this this range is what a a just write down a here that's it in bracket we are not doing anything we are just printing these elements so just write down B and it will print one two three so this statement would be executed repeatedly for each element for each element in this in this expression in this a so for one also for two also for three hours also it would be executed so it will print one two three right and with the traditional Loop if you want to print all the elements then what you will do for we have to take like int I is equal to 0 then semicolon then I less than equal to you have to be aware about the size of this array how many elements are there one two three elements so till I less than equal to two or maybe less than three semicolon and I plus plus increment or decrement whatever you have to do you have to write and then C out this I right that's what you have to do so see the difference between the traditional Loop and this Loop here what you can say the benefits are no need to worry about the length of the array or the size of the array right no need to worry about the increment or decrement anything right you just need one iterator iterator means the B which is going to iterate for each element just an iterator right that's it and just write down the name of that collection that array and it will handle everything if you update here the size four five no need to update here but here you need to update if you want to access all the elements because otherwise it will access 0 1 2 till 2 it will come only three iterated iteration one two three four five are remaining so you have to update here less than five but he had no need to update so as you can see it is easy and convenient to use range based volume right over a collection fine but some drawbacks are this this will not work on the index right so if you want to Target a specific element or a element at a specific index we cannot Target that element because we are just iterating for f for each element we are not working on the index so we cannot it's like we want to skip a particular element we cannot skip that thing using index we cannot access or if you want to do so that would be very complex problem very complex right and if you want to in a reverse manner if you want to iterate you cannot do directly here for that also you will have to do some complex logic but here we can do simply you can iterate backward okay the index you can provide first of all 0 1 2 3 4 the index would be first of all four you can provide n i greater than 0 greater than equal to 0. that's it right so that would be reversibly printed as array so yeah there are some advantages of this Loop and also some drawbacks of range base volume okay now one more important point this variable this range declaration this variable is local for this for Loop you cannot redeclare this variable in this expression in this range expression or in these statements within this module if you want to declare another wave into B again here so that would give error right so you cannot redeclare this variable is local to this for Loop only right now if you you don't know like what is the data type of the collection you are using that is very complex one so rather than this you can simply use a keyword Auto one more headache is going for you Auto will automatically reduce the data type from the initial value see what this B is getting value from a so first time from a in B1 would be assigned right so it will add it will check the expression the data type of the expression is int because it is getting the initial value from here so the here the expression the data type is in so automatically it will deduce this to n so it is what known as type inference in C plus plus automatically deduce the data type of any variable or function right we can do with this Auto keyword right so that is also a plus point for you you don't need to worry about the data type of the collection you are using just use Auto and also like pass by uh by reference also you can pass like address of B that also will be discussed like call by value and call by reference but for now this is the basic idea of range based for Loop right and rather than this rather than using this directly here also we can use like one two three four five directly collection list you can put here right right on a vector also you can use Vector is nothing similar array similar like arrays but it's a dynamic array dynamically the size can be changes uh changed in Vector array is what fixed size and if Vector is what a dynamic array so how to declare Vector simply we write down Vector here we just run on the data type suppose int Vector name any name a b c x y anything suppose a and the values one two three that is simply vector so rather than a here also you can do like Auto B is equal to the vector name the expression is Vector name Vector name is a so just write down a here that is also fine and whatever you want to do on these elements you can do here here I'm just printing but whatever you want to do if you want to add or you want to find out maximum number minimum number or any logic or average anything you can do here right these statements whatever you will write uh this thing you need to be very you know clear about this thing these statement would be executed repeatedly and sequently for each element in this expression for each element in here in this expression whatever expression you use right so let's just do some practical of this range based for Loop okay so let's create a new file here and the name I'm taking range based full loop first of all iostream will import this and then namespace namespace STD then in Main and the main function we write what we simply take first of all array an example of array so a and here I am taking like one two three only three elements that's it semicolon very important for Loop range base volume so in four first declare a variable so rather than end just use Auto better to use Auto and any variable name let's take B and colon and then name of that range expression the name of this range expression is a so a right and then we are not we are not doing anything just C out we are printing this B and line okay and then just return 0. fine let's run this in see we are getting one two three the output right one because the statement would be executed for each element first time one would be assigned to this B one would be actually copied to this B then it would be printed then second second iteration 2 would be copied from A to B then 2 would be printed then third in third iteration 3 from a would be copied to B and then it would be printed so actually it's called by value you can say all the elements will do three are copied basically it's no need to copy all the elements so we can this we can do pass by reference call by reference like we can do here something like this address of address of B is equal to a something like this but that will be discussing in other video that this video is about basic of uh range base for Loop rather than Auto if you know the data type you can simply write down the rate I but that should be same and if you don't want to take this headache simply write down your O2 automatically it will get the data type from the initial value of this B from this expression right so now rather than this you directly write down this thing like here rather than a if I write down this I'm not taking any this thing all right so now let's run this and see same output you will get here one two three right okay now let's do this on Vector I am taking a vector vector is nothing but a dynamic array vector and the syntax is this and data type I am taking int or flow to double or care any data type you can take int Vector name I am taking suppose num equal to same one three five six something like this okay and here same Vector the layer type is int so int any variable name I'm taking b or you can take like n and here I am taking the name of the expression is num okay I forgot the semicolon here right but see you cannot directly use Vector here see identifier Vector is undefined you have to import you have to include vector the sender file right then we can use Vector see now this is not giving any error see class STD we have Vector n in this name space STD so this is also important to import okay rather than V now we have variable name n so this also you need to take a let's run this and it will give you one three five six this output right on a string also we can apply this because string is also a range or a collection of characters so if I do something like this here and I'm taking like care see colon and here I'm writing Jenny something like this rather than N I am printing C now let's run this on a string also we can use this for you so j e n n y it will print something like this right and if I suppose update this it should be Jenny space and if I remove the C and there and just simply print C then it will print as it is Jenny Spacek right and if there is a if you want to print without any space so you can do something like if you can put some condition if C not equal to space then only print this C right let's run this this time it will not print space with no space so like this you can do something different here within this block it's not like that only you have to print whatever expression you are closing you know if you are using this Vector you can do sum so suppose one assignment for you is you just take a vector or just array Loop and calculate sum of that array or that vector or that collection and print the sum this is for your assignment what you can say your exercise you can just write down your comment error your code in the comment section so I hope you got what does range base for Loop in C plus plus now in next video we'll see one coding exercise on this English for Loop so now we'll see you next week
