so we are done with types of stories classes and in the previous video I have discussed two question on the stories class technical interview question and this video we'll see three or four more question on stories classes previous year gate question right see this is uh gate CS 2012 question so this question is containing static uh storage class two question we'll discuss on external stories class and one on register stories class total four question we going to discuss in this video now explain what output you will get like a code is given and they they are asking like the output of this code what would be the output of this code so we'll discuss why you are getting that output the reason behind that if you are getting any error why you are getting that kind of error it is a compiler error or is it a Linker error everything we'll discuss in this video now let's see the answer of this question see this question I have already discussed in my previous videos when you are using static and static storage class here the answer of this question would be I'm just going to tell you you just you know practice this and see you are getting the same answer or not this would be 42 then 62 and 2 but one more question was there the code is same but the next question was that was asked in Gate CS 2012 like this is this line This is line one this is line two they have given this line one this line to and this would be replaced by Auto in a equal to 1 and this was replaced by resistor in a is equal to 2 now what output you will get when static word was there then this output was there I have discussed already this question but next question is now Auto and resistor now what output you will get see first of all obviously when you will run this control will go to the main function here you will see auto int a so memory would be allocated to this one a and one would be stored here now function would be called here now here we have resister in a is equal to 2 so one more variable a local to this function and here we have two now second B and here we have one now next line is a plus equal to Plus+ B so it means this line can also be written as AAL A ++ + B right so this plus plus is having higher precedent so this would be executed first plus plus b means B is one pre ment means it becomes 2 now so 2 a is 2 2 + 2 is equal 4 now a becomes 4 now print what output you will get first of all four and B value is 2 so 42 right now back to here after the exit of this function now next line is a plus equal to 1 so it means a equal to a + 1 right so now a value becomes two right again function call again function would be called now resistor in a equal to 2 now this is resistor variable right so it's it's not static so it would it would be initialized again the lifetime of this variable is within this block right till the end of this block only and scope is also within this block right so now again we will initialize this with two the previous previous value would be gone and now again it would be ized with 2 now int B is equal to 1 so again B would be 1 now again this line plus plus b and this thing so now a is 2 and B is plus plus b is 2 four so again four will be printed and B is also four plus plus b plus plus b so it becomes uh 2 so B is also two so four and two now exit from this function means back to here now here again one print of statement A and B we are going to print so A and B which are local to this function that would be printed now a value is two so now two would be printed now in this function we don't have any B any local variable B right so is it give now will it give error no because we have a global variable B so it will search do we have any Global variable B yes we have B so B is equal to Z Now B is equal to 0 so it will print Z so at this point of time answer would be 42 42 and 2 0 if we using Auto and static if here is sorry auto and resist if static and static then this output you will get right so this was one question now next question is so these are two more question one is this one is this let me discuss this first we have a global variable in I is equal to 5 so by default this class of this would be extern now in main I have just written extern int J one more variable J and I'm printing I and J and after that I'm defining in J is equal to 10 a local variable to this Main and return zero now what output you will get see okay Global variable in I is equal to Z so maybe you will think it will print okay five now extern int J this line means it's not definition it's not memory allocation of this uh J it is just a declaration of this J it means this line will tell the compiler we are using external keyword this will tell the compiler that J is defined J has been defined in another block not within this block not in this main outside of this block whe where we are using this extern inj statement outside of this block J has been defined and we have to use that J right J is defined somewhere else maybe in another file if if you are including any other file so it will search in that file if you're not including any other file like hash include and in double code that file name then outside of this blog it will search now see after that after that we are having within this block only we are having in J equal to 10 but before this line we have this line so it will tell the Linker like compiler it's okay okay J has has been defined somewhere else outside of this block it will give this problem to Linker to resolve this problem like no link the value of J here Linker but outside of this blog do we have any J no so it will give Linker error undefined reference to this J we don't have any J outside of this blow it will not access this J because this J is within this block only and after this line within this block extern means outside of this block this J must present outside of must be outside of this block but there is no J no Global variable J so it will give error only Linker error not compiler error Linker error it will give I hope you're getting my point now same with this see just a little bit different from this in main we have extern int I print f are printing I and one more block is there here we are taking in I equal to 10 and again we are printing I and that's it what it will give same first line the compiler will see extern int I it means we are using extern it means uh it will tell the compiler that this I has been defined already but outside of this block outside of this block where we are using this statement means outside of this main block let's search for that I and I'm going to use that I that value only this is just a declaration but now Linker will link that thing but Linker will not able to link because outside of this block we don't have any I do we have no maybe you will think this is the in this block but this block is within this block only right so it will not not go for this value it will search the value of five which is outside of this blow if you declare here in I is equal to 10 not here then it's fine because this I is outside of this block where we are using this extern in I so it will exess this 10 at this point of time so 10 and 10 would be printed but this time it will give error Linker error not compiler error Linker error Define reference to this I both will give error right now next uh question is so this is the next question we are using register int data is equal to 10 we are taking a pointer int estri Pi some data initializing it with null then address of data we are initializing we are know initializing this pointer with address of this data this variable now in this estri Pi sum data we are entering a value five and then we are printing this the value using the pointer in Direction operator now what value you will get here see here also you will get error why so because I have already told you when we were discussing resist storage class like this is resister variable data so it will be stored not in memory in CPU registor so it is not having any memory location with it if it is not having any memory location with it then how you can access the address of this variable and store in some pointer yes we cannot access the address because it is being stored in register CPU register not in memory location so it will give error like you have requested address of a register variable data and that's wrong right we cannot request address of a register variable only if it is like Auto then it is fine it will access it the address because now at this point of time it is Auto and it will be in memory stored in memory so it will have some memory location we can fetch that memory location we can store that memory location in that pointer and that's it right but if we have register here then at that point in time it will give error so the assignment for you is now we don't have any register here simple in data is equal to 10 now what output you will get here now this you have to tell me in comment box I hope now you are familiar with the storage classes and what type of questions would be asked in competitive exam and maybe asked in y was right we have discussed almost one one question on every stories class right so now I hope you got all these thing about stories classes and the questions why you are getting that kind of output so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
