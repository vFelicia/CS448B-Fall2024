now see in this video we'll discuss how to da Rays are related with pointers how you can access the elements of a 2d array with the help of pointer rather than using the array name fine so if you have discussed the relationship between arrays and pointers I mean that 1d array and pointers you can check out that video also in that I button fine now see let us take this this is to react this is how we are going to declare the 2d area you can say that initialize the 2d I have initialized this area at compile time only fine 3 into 3 means this 3 rows would be there and 3 columns would be there like this this is a 3 into 3 matrix 3 rows are there and 3 columns are there these are the values and this is the actual representation of this 3 into 3 matrix or you can say this 2d array in memory this is just a logical representation fine we have taken that row major implementation of 2d array first of all this first row is to be stored 6 to 5 then second row and then third row fine so you can say that it's 2d array is what it's an array of arrays how see in this case we are having 3 arrays if you see this 1 6 2 & 3 this is what a 1d array this is another 1d array and this is another one dear and each 1d arrays having three integer elements fine and if you combine these three then it forms a 2d array so you can say the 2d array is what it's an array of arrays or this this 2d arrays what it's an array of 3 1d arrays and each one day array is having elements how many three elements fine so you can see this this is what this is what a of zero that 1d array of zero or this is what another 1d array the name is a of 1 and this is another one D and the a name is a of 2 right so a 2d array e is having 3 1 diaries' a 0 a 1 and a 2 and each one D a D is having 3 in pisa elements 3 integer values right so see have you can see how you can write this this way of zeroes you can say this so this element first element is a of 0 if you simply write a of 0 it means it itself a 1d array and the name of an array name of an array contains what address of its that first element of the array or you can say it points to the first element of the array so if you write a of 0 it means it contains hundred the element of its first address so 100 if you write a of 1 it means it itself your 1 is a 1d array and if you say a of 1 it it means it is a name of array name of array contains base address or you can say address it points to the first integer element in there the first element is containing address 1 1 to save a of 2 contains 1 2 4 you can you can write it like this this a of 0 contains these three integer values this contains these three integer values and this contains these three integer values and this is the base address of these arrays fine so a 2d array is what it's an array of arrays now let us take a pointer now I have initialized I have taken a pointer this is how you are going to be clear a pointer variable this point this variable this pointer variable is going to contain address of another variable and the data type of that variable is integer so it is a pointer to integer fine so here can we write P is equal to CP contains what address of some another integer variable address off integer readable so can I write here a the name of theory as we have discussed in 1d array in 1d array that is fine but here this is not right this invalid now why so see if you write simple this a is name of 2d array and what array name returns array name returns the pointer to its first element right so now in 2d array first element is what in this 2d array we are having three elements this one this one and this one you can say it is having three one DNA's so if you simply write a it means it returns what this pointer to its first element first element is what a of zero it means it returns one pointer to our 1d array it is not going to return pointer to an integer fine so but P can contain address of an integer variable only so this is invalid right so now here you can write here you can write address of a of zero and zero a of 0 0 means this value an address so this is what 100 so it means address of a of 0 0 means it will return address of a integer variable that is the 6 is an integer variable it will return address of this integer variable and that is fine or you can write or you can write P is equal to a of 0 that is also valid now why so see if you write a of 0 it means this first array 1 D array fine so if you write the name of the serie the name of the name of the array what name of dairy always returns what pointer to its first variable right but you can say address of its first variable fine so it will point to here if you write name of there it will point to here address of its point to its first integer variable and 6 what variable it will return 100 100 will be stored at in this pointer because pointer can contain address of another integer variable so this is fine you can write this thing fine but you cannot write P is equal to a of zero and zero why so because a of zero and zero it means it will return what when you that is six but pointer cannot contain a value so this is invalid right so you cannot write this thing so now if you want to print the address of this to DNA that is this base address that is hundred I have taken hundred here fine so if you want to print in hexadecimal form you can write down percentage P otherwise you can write down percentage you fine it will print in unsigned integer some integer value so you can print if you print in printf I guess you can write printf % is you and you can write whatever you want to print so if you print I am NOT going to write the complete printf statement P right if you simply print this P then it will return what because here we have declared a pointer P somewhere in memory this pointer is going to be allocated some memory location so this P is now going to store address of a of 0 0 that is 100 so now P is going to point here so if you will print this P then 100 would be printed fine or rather than P you can write what a simply the name of the area so the name of there a 2d or it will give what the address of the first element first element is what a of 0 and the address of a of 0 is what 100 only fine you can say that base address of this is 100 so it will print hundred or you can write address of a of 0 0 this will also print hundred fine or you can write address of a address of a means a means this array name complete name address of a means it will give points to the address base address of the complete area the whole area come they said this is what hundred so it will print hundred all you can write s trick e now high strike a will print 100 because Esther it means dereferencing operator and it will print what the value at that address now see if you write simple a it means it will return what any name is a it will return what that pointer to its first element or you can say that address of its first element now in this area first element in 2d arrays this complete 1d array right because it is having three elements three 1d array so a of zero now s trick a of zero it means well you add as a of zero when you add this means this complete 1d array value doesn't mean doesn't mean that it is it is returning either six two or five because at a over zero at this address it will return at this element the complete 1d array fine so it will return what this this base address of this one that is 100 100 0 of 0 contains what 100 fine so it will return 100 or you can write a of 0 this will also return what hundred because a of 0 means a of 0 that is name of the array this this a of 0 means this name of this complete array 1d array name of the array if you write down name of that a that that will return what address of the first element in this area means the first element in this array 6 address is 100 so it will litter 100 fine although this a and address of a is returning the same value but they are different how they are different I will discuss in this video later so now if you print a plus 1 in % is F if you write a plus 1 then what should be the value C this a name of the 2d array it will return what pointer to this first element in this area first element is this complete 1d array that is a of 0 fine and this is a pointer a of 0 that is it is going to return Poynter to do this one and if you add in a pointer if you add plus one it means it is going to point to the next variable that we have discussed in 1d array also so it will point here next variable and this is complete 1d array that is this a of one right now it is going to point here now what what if it will return if you write a 1 then it means it will return the base address of its first element or you can say it points to here the first element in this array the address of this one is 1 1 2 so it is going to return 1 1 so from here you can see a will return this point a will point to a of 0 a of 0 contains hundred and if you add +1 then it will jump to the next element next element is a 1 that is the complete 1d array so it is going to return the base address of the first element that is 1 1 2 or you can write address OFI of 1 because you often you can write in this form also at the sofa of 1 fine a of 1 this array name address of array will return the base address of this array base address of this this complete array is 1 1 2 so it will return 1 1 2 only and if you write this 1s trick a plus 1 then what should be the value then also it will return 1 1 2 how see here a means same name of this 2d array it is going to points to the first element but you can say it is going to return the address of the first element now first element in this 2d array is this complete 1d array that is a of 0 fine if you add plus 1 if you add plus 1 in this case then it is going to point to the next element that is next element is also complete 1d airing in this 2d array that is a of 1 fine and if you do s trick a of 1 it means when you act this pointer value at this address when you is this complete 1d array value is not single integer value it value is this complete 1d array fine so it is going to return what this one one to the this this base head is that is one one two so it is also going to return 1 1 to here or you can write a of one only because s tricky up one is equal to a o 1 only so if you write a of 1 here 1 means this one and array this is a complete array a of 1 is complete array and array name will points will return always the address of its first element so this is 1 1 2 it is going to return 1 1 2 only this can also be written something like this estwick a plus 1 fine that we have discussed in 1d array also and if you write address of a of 1 and 0 a of 1 means roll number row is this one index of row is this one second robot index is 1 and column is 0 and address of this one is 1 1 2 so it is going to it another one to only this is also same fine now if you write a strict a plus 1 plus supposed to now what it is going to print now cs3 K plus 1 a is going to return what this the address of 1st element first element is this complete array if you add plus 1 here then it is going to point to the next element in this array next element is also a complete 1d array and s trick this means it is going to return this complete 1d array value is complete 1d array so the sequence of the base address so for you address of this first element that is 1 1 2 it in this 1 1 2 you are going to add plus 2 it means it is going to add how many bytes 1 integer is going to take 4 bytes that is 8 bytes so it is going to point here at 120 so it will return 120 and if you want to print the value at 120 that is 3 then simply print the value what you are going to take that dereferencing operator so if you you are going to print this value then simply you can write say this one this is same this is giving this is going to give you 120 and value at 120 if you want to print then just do a again write an e referencing operator so it is going to print the value that is 3 so you can say it is a double pointer you can implement you can also declare a double pointer and you can implement the studio fine now see this is how we are going to print the value now this this is going to print the value ad see if you print a of 1 and 2 that will also going to print 3 means if one roll number is 1 this row 1 and second column 0 1 2 and second column that is 3 a of 1 and 2 you here you will write Plus this roll number and here you will write column number so if you are going to print this value suppose this one for it means a of 2 and 0 then in this form hub you can write you can write s trick again s trick a plus this row number that is 2 plus column number that is 0 and this is going to print 4 right so in general you can write C this is how we are going to access a of I and J the value of 2d array so if you want to write this in the form of pointer then how you can write you can write here s trick again s trick a plus I plus J this is same if I J's you can do this one right or if you want to use the pointer then this pointer is also going to store the space address 2 rather than using this a you can write here the pointer name P all rather than this rather than this how you can write this C astrick of a plus 1 is equal to a of 1 right so in this case here we can write a of 1 plus 2 plus two and you just write a straight fine so here simply you can write a strick a of this I plus J so this this and this is going to be this is going to give you same result that as you can access that this value is using either this one or this or this expression or rather than a you can write here P also that will also do that is also going to give you same result now suppose if you want to print a straight A plus one and again a straight now what should be the output of this thing just think about it see Esther it a here step by step here in to solve this a a means it is going to return a snake of 2d array so it is going to return what if you write down name of an array so it is going to return pointer to its first element or you can say address of its first element first element in 2d arrays this complete one dear fine so it is going to return pointer to this one da find out you can say this address of this 1d array now a straight a astray K means value at this address value is what value is this complete 1d array fine or you can say that base address of the say dress of its first element that is hundred it is going to return value at a of zero is what hundred it is going to return hundred this element sorry the pointer to its first element that is 100 now 100 plus one this is a pointer if you want to add some arithmetic or some integer values and then it is going to what point to the next variable how many bytes is going to be added four bytes fine so it is going to point here at 104 so this is what 1 0 4 s trick 1 0 4 means value at 1 0 4 is 2 so it is going to turn what to here now the question for you is if you print history s trick a then what will be the output right and if you print a strict s trick this P then what will be the output so you are going to try this one and you are going to tell me in the comment box what should be the output of AD Esther that's tricky and Esther gets trick P now last point is add one plus one and address of a oh one plus one what should be the output of B's when you see here a of 1 a of 1 means this one the name of this one D array and name of 1d array means it is going to return what does pointer to its first integer value or first variable you can say that address of its first in Pisa variable that is 1 1 2 it is going to return 1 1 2 in this one if you add 1 then it is going to point to the obviously the next variable is sorry the next value so that is it is going to point here it means it becomes 1 1 6 fine now what is the value of this address of a of 1 + 1 C address of 1 if you printed a of 1 and address of a of 1 both will return what this 1 1 2 so you will say this and this would also return same value that is 1 1 6 button that is not right how these things are different see let us discuss it with one DNA then you will get it better see now suppose we have taken one area one D array size 3 elements are 1 4 & 3 address the whole base address is 200 next element 4 to 0 for our next is 2 0 8 if you print a and address of a a means name of the array C name of there is address of a and a both will return 200 fine and save a plus 1 and address of a plus 1 then you will say these are going to return same thing because a and address of a are same but that is different thing see here it simple you are writing name of the array name of there a means it is going to give you the pointer to its first value or you can say it is going to give you the address of the first element of theory so first element of the array first element of their address is 200 that is why it is going to give 200 fine and address of a address of a means it is going to give you the address or you can say the base address of the complete array for this complete array the base address is also 200 that is why it is going to give you 200 that is why these both are same but if you had plus one and plus one in that case they are different see a plus one it means it is it is pointing to the first variable first variable and if you do plus one arithmetic plus one in the pointer then it is going to point the CUDA obviously the next element so it is going to point here that is two zero four but address of a means it is going to give you the array the pointer to the complete array so that is also 200 address of a but if you do plus one plus one it means it is going to add how many bytes size of arrays 3 so 3 into 4 that is it is going to add to L bytes because it is going to give you the address of the complete end so now in this case it is going to point here after this complete array here the next part so it means you can say this plus 12 that is 2 1 2 it is going to give you 2 & 2 same in this case a 1 plus 1 that is 1 1 6 now address of a 1 plus 1 address of a 1 a 1 means this this array this 1d array address means this it is going to give you the address or the base address of this complete 1d array that is 1 1 ok 1 1 2 plus now if you add plus 1 it means how many bytes is going to add see sighs Oh fairies one two and through three elements are there in this oneday era so 3 into 4 that is 2l bytes that is 2 well it means 1 to 4 so that is why now it is going to point from 1 1 to 2 here 1 2 1 2 the next element it is going to switch this complete array then it is going to point this the next element of or you can say the next one the error that is 1 2 4 this is the difference between this and this see I can now discuss everything in one video so it's up to you you can try different different expressions like this like this or any other expression and you can check out what the output is fine so I'll see in the next video till then byebye taking
