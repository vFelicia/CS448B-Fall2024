hi everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing functions till now we have discussed some Basics or functions only like introduction to functions and based on that we have done three coding exercises right now the next point or the next step in functions is what functions with arguments right in previous video we have seen one function like when we're discussing the introduction to function in that video we have created a grid function like this I hope you have seen that video and you know how to define a function just diff keyword the function name greet these parenthesis then the colon and whatever you want to execute here suppose I want to execute like High and then I want to print these two things like hi and then are you from CS Department computer science department right so this is definition of this function right yeah this is not complete definition that we have discussed in the syntax like if you want to pass the parameter you can pass then we have a return statement also return expression but this function is not returning anything and we are not passing anything here so simple one this thing we have discussed but this will not do anything if you will run this program because you have to call the function right you have execute that function to get the output you have to call that function so how to call just name of the function and that's it these parenthesis green no colon here so whenever you will call it it will print two line hi are you from computer science department again if you call again equipment two line hi are you from computer science department CS Department like this like this is the basic one right but see if rather than this you want to print like hi Jenny are you from computer science department right so what you do simple trick is simply write here hi Jenny okay fine but next time I want to print like hi Ram so it's not like that we will Define another function like this grid one greet two and there we will print hi Ram are you from computer science department or again we will change here like hi Ram are you from computer science department like this but again if I want to create like high sham then what we'll do will you again change here sham no that is not a good idea and although no that is not a good idea but again if you define one function from another function for sham another function from Jenny the same like grid one great two great that is also not a good idea right then what is the use of using these functions you are repeating these lines again and again and again not repeating you are not reusing you are just writing again and again so what is use of function right so what I want whatever I will say that like the user say Jenny so that your function will accept that thing Jenny and then it will print hi Jenny are you from computer science department again if users say Ram so this your function should accept that Ram right and high Ram are you from computer science department next time then hi sham are you from computer science department the same function only one function right so for that you have to obviously call that function and you have to pass that thing right like if you want me to teach you then you should call me like Jenny like uh python so genuine please teach python right or if you want me to teach you C plus plus so you will call you will call me first that is important call me if you not call me then I cannot read your mind right like if you want to study C plus plus for me or python from me or uh database or anything so you have to call me same you have to call the function like I am a function right and you have to pass that subject also you have to like tell me the subject like please teach that is like teach is a function teach python okay then I will accept okay you are saying python okay I'll teach python again if you want like teach C plus plus then you will save me Teach please ma'am teach us C plus plus then I'll accept that C plus plus as a subject and then I'll teach like I'll execute myself something like this I hope you can relate this thing anyway now see so here rather than this we simply we are just writing like this so pass call the function when you will pass that thing whatever value you want to pass when you are calling that function obviously because that is the main thing control will first of all go here function calling right so here just pass like greed if I pass Jenny okay so now control will go here it will search the way the definition of the function definition of the function is here def green now this should be same the calling and this so here if you are passing something then here there should be something to accept that value and how to accept where to store generally in you know in our computer will store that information in variables in you know in variables right so just take a variable here like name so we'll pass Jenny here now this name will accept Jenny now we know on Jenny I have to do some like you can say functioning so I want to print like hi Jenny so what we can do hi we can use like a F string we have discussed what is F string in the previous videos just here you have to put F in print hi and the name of the variable name of the variable is name so it will this name it will pick up Jenny from here are you from computer science department fine next time if I want to greet Ram so just call another function just greet and RAM so it will print first hi Jenny are you from government size Department then here then again it will call now this time in name we have Ram so hi Ram are you from computer science department right so this is what these functions are we are providing some input to these functions or we can say argument to these function now see if General syntax if you write functions with arguments then how would you will how you will write uh we will write something like this I hope now you can write this pause the video and you can just try it out So Def here General syntax the function name and parameters and then column then function body right or if you are about to write in the complete thing then you can write down like a return expression within this function only but this return is what optional here we are not returning anything we are just printing and this is the definition of the function and calling is what just the function name and here you pass the value value means here you pass the arguments okay now I hope this is clear to you guys how to define a function with parameter how to call now another thing is what is difference between parameter and argument there is also one of one of the question in these or sometimes an interview also they ask this question what is parameter and argument so see here I have written arguments means whatever value the actual value you pass while calling the function that is argument or you can say actual parameter right and the variable name you you know use to hold or to accept that value while defining the function that is known as formal parameter or you can say parameters I hope the difference is clear to you guys these are parameter or formal parameter these are actual parameters or arguments you can say right now here as many arguments you can pass as you want like here I have passed only one argument one two three four five up to you or according to your need like if you are doing some of two numbers then what you will do you just pass two arguments have to write down that thing okay the here one exercise for you is if you have to write down a function add and there it should accept two arguments right and it will print edition now pause the video and try this out so I hope you have tried this out so let's create a new file here and we will say like function underscore width argument dot p y not C okay I hope you have done that Edition uh that function you have defined that function addition so how to define depth add and okay rather than defining when you will call when you will pass that those values like I want to add two numbers like maybe five or two right okay when like I have given you that example if you want me to teach you then you will call like ma'am please teach python you will call me so at the time of calling we pass our data the value right so how to call add suppose add and I want to pass like 5 comma 7. but how to add this computer doesn't know how to add these numbers you have to provide those instructions so you have to Define that function first so just depth the function name add and to store these values to variables variables obviously we are going to store the values call and end there we take another variable C is equal to suppose a plus b and simply we print using Okay using an app for string right like print and F and here we will store like sum is in which variable we have sum in C that's it right and you can call this ad 5 and 7. so let's run this I think it was easy you have done this it should print 12 so this sum is 12. if you want to add another number like 8 and 9 I want to add it's okay you can you can another if again call this function and pass your value eight and nine see the sum is 12 the sum is 17 like this so we are passing in this case two arguments right and in Grid we were passing only one like name okay but see you have to call the function with exact number of arguments by default otherwise it will give error suppose here we have two arguments A and B means this function is you know expecting two values right and if you call this with only one value suppose five let's run this it will give error see type error missing one required positional argument so that we will see in the next video what is positional argument but you can see like there is missing one argument is missing right this is type one of the type of the argument positional argument so you have to pass exact number of arguments right so you have to pass two arguments here you cannot pass three note more argument not less argument by default you have to pass this thing we can pass like if uh the yeah there is a case also if this functioning is accepting you know two arguments and you are passing only one argument then also it will work but that is different case in the next we will see types of argument then I'll show you how this is possible but right now by default you have to pass something like this two argument the same exact number of argument right and a function without argument is also possible right but if you want to process something like here I want to add two numbers so I want to process addition on two numbers so just pass the information here so these arguments have to pass the information to the function right so that this function will perform some operation on that operation and then it will print or maybe it will return that value right so uh like if on different different inputs I want to perform this addition in that case it is better to pass arguments like suppose addition I want to you know print 10 times one time the addition of five and seven then eight and nine then one and two then 100 and 200 like this so in different different inputs you want to you know do addition of these numbers so just pass that value in the form of arguments right okay so here these five and seven these are arguments so you can say actual parameters and this A and B are parameters so you can say formal parameters right okay the grid function you can try I guess that was easy right okay so I hope this is clear to you guys functions with arguments or with inputs how to define this those functions how to a new call how to use those functions in your program but we have different types of arguments right so in the next video we will see types of arguments so now we'll say the next tutorial then bye take care
