so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language in the previous video we have discussed features of c plus plus in this video we'll talk about history of c plus plus before moving further in this course at least you should have some you know basic idea about history of this language like the versions the latest version the improvement made in this language time by time so these things will discuss briefly in this video right but before that i just want to tell you one thing if you are interested in competitive programming then dx4 weeks has come up with something really exciting for you guys that you cannot miss out they're going to start a summer training batch from 21st of may so it is a great opportunity for you guys to enhance your skills during your summer vacations whether you want to be a programmer in top company or you wish to drop the charts of leading coding competitions you have come to write please a live weekend classroom program designed for the people who wish to excel in competitive programming and sd interviews so now you can learn competitive programming through a live course designed by industry experts to help you enhance your problem solving skills and prerequisite for this courses basic knowledge of programming language and basic knowledge of data structure and algorithm and in this course will be mentored by the experts and this also includes dsa course quizzes more contests and much more so what you will learn in this course all the important concepts of data structure and algorithms how to improve your problem solving skills various efficient techniques uh for competitive programming and efficient implementation of mathematical algorithms so as i have told you this training batch is going to be started from 21st of may so go and get yourself registered to get counseling the and you can use my code jenny10 to get 10 discount for the same so the registration link and all the relevant details i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now as we know c was developed by dennis richie in 1970 at atnt bell laboratories to develop unix operating system right so c plus plus was developed by bjornik straustra he was a computer scientist at atnt bell laboratories it was developed and he started working on the development of this language since 1979 1979. he was working on his phd you know thesis work at that time he you know got a chance to work in similar language similar programming language and similar 67 was the first objectoriented programming language it was the first language who supported oops concepts right so he thought that these concepts these oops concepts would be you know very beneficial to develop large softwares so these concepts he thought that can be used in software development but this language was similar language was it was used for simulation purpose and it was too slow for practical use right and that time c was popular language so he got a chance to work in c language so he thought to combine c language these oops concept in c language right because this was too slow sorry this was you know too slow for practical use although bcpl was a language it was fast but it was too low level programming language and it is not suited for suitable for software development so he chose c language why because it was general purpose programming language high level programming language fast portable and it was widely used at that time so he thought to combine some oops concept in c right he thought to make a better c language right so that's why c plus plus is known as extension of c or superset of c all the features the basic functionalities of c was as it is only he added some new concept oops concept so the first language it was not known as c plus plus it was known as c with glasses some basic features were added like you can say classes uh basic inheritance single inheritance concept default function argument concept inlining polymorphism so these concepts these features were added and it was known as c with classes and the first c with classes compiler was also released known as seafront right it was derived from the compass c compiler c pre was a compiler it was derived from that compiler and the main the interesting fact is what c front this compiler was written in c with classes language only so it was you can say selfhosting compiler a compiler that will compile itself but the use of this compiler was abandoned in 1993 right because it became difficult to add new features to integrate new features into it so it was abandoned the use of this was abandoned in 1993 actually now it was renamed as c plus plus in 1985 but it was not standardized yet and more features were added around this time like virtual functions function overloading the cost keyword a single line argument using two forward slash right now in 1985 the first it was the first commercial version was released in 1985. so the first edition you can see the first edition the c plus plus programming language so in this 1985 the first edition of this the c plus plus programming language this book was released but it was not standardized yet and c plus plus was also implemented as a commercial product in the same year right means you can say it was made available outside of the bell labs first time in 1985 then in 1989 also some new features were added like protected and static members multiple inheritance these kind of features were added and you can see that c plus 2.0 was released in 1989 then in 1990 the annotated c plus reference manual was released i hope you know the meaning of annotated it means like to add a description or to add some information a piece of information to a data or an image to describe about that image or that data right some you can say nodes these kind of things so that reference manual was released in 1990 and in the same year borland turbo c plus plus compiler you know was also released as a commercial product and the last stable release for this compiler was in 2006 but still we use this compiler right now again in 1998 the standard committee release the first international standard of c plus plus that was c plus plus 98 means it was standardized by iso in 1998 the version was known as c plus plus 98 and standard template library was also included stl right in this version now again in 2003 a minor update got released that was known as c plus plus zero three in which the committee did what they resolved the multiple problems that were there in c plus but that will you know that were reported in this standard c plus plus 98 standard so they fixed those you can say bugs or the problems and released a new update that was known as c plus plus 0 3 in 2003 right and then in 2005 the same committee the standard committee released a technical report in this report what was there features various new features that they were planning to add in the latest version of the c plus right they released that report but the next version the next standard were released in 11 after you can say eight years see that previous was in 2003 c plus plus zero three so after eight years next version was released it was the longest interval between those release in five they obviously they released a technical report that they want to add these features and they were planning to release that new standard before 2010 so they named that the draft as c plus plus 0x means before 10 they won't they wanted to release this but because of some reason it was not possible and then in the mid 2011 they released a new version with major updates that was c plus plus 11 many new features were added like auto keyword and that resistor keyword was depleted in 2011 right not removed but it was deprecated it was not recommended to use that register keyword it was replaced by another keyword that auto keyword regular expression support new libraries new time library so many features were added this was a major release 11 lambda expressions right after that in 14 it was not a major one it was a minor update release bug some bug fixes that was in this one and small improvement in c plus plus 11 only and it was known as c plus plus 14 then in 17 again major release was there with that addition of new features and with a great changes in this version that was known as c plus plus 17. like in this they removed the resistor keyboard right it was unused and reserved that's the sticky one in 11 it was deprecated right it was removed in c plus plus 17 version and many new header files and libraries were added in this one and some obsolete features some things were removed from this this one from this version and this was known as c plus 17 and then next in 20 c plus 20 28 is the latest version of this language next will be coming in 23 that would be named as c plus plus 23. like like in this they have added new features one example is they have added a threeway comparison operator this is the operator if you can write the this and this right a this operator is known as threeway comparison operator so many these kind of features were added we'll be discussing in detail about these features when we move in this course this is just a small you can say briefly we have discussed history of c plus i hope you go this right so now that's it for this video if i have left something you can write down that thing in comment box maybe other can get help from your comment right so now i'll see in the next video till then bye
