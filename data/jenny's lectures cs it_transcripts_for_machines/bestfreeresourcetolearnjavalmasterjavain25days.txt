hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good and as you are done with your exams and starting your summer breaks so I have an amazing update for you guys to utilize your summer break this time coding ninjas has come up with a Java guide path challenge now what is this Java guided path challenge the duration of this thing and why first of all why you should go for this thing what are the benefits you will get right and how you can go for this thing how to register the link whether you will get a certificate or not after completion answer all these questions you will get in this video right though I mean the content also what they are going to teach you what you will get in this guided path right now first thing why you should go for the schedule path okay very first thing is this guided path covers basic to advanced level topics in a structured way with detailed notes followed by some practice problems also so first we will get the theory part the notes and then mcqs and some practice problems right and all the important topics would be covered introductory topics like uh variables operators and control statements and then Advanced topics like arrays strings oops Concepts in Java right and the time to finish this scheduled path challenge is 25 days so what you have to do to be a part of this challenge first of all you have to login to code Studio and you have to finish finish this in next 25 days now how you can log in how you can go for this guided path let me just show you all the things okay so all the relevant links will get in the description box of this video Once you click on that link this type of page would be opened and to be a part of this challenge you have to log in first to the code Studio so you have to log in here you can just login with your any account Google Facebook or Nokia or you can just register just entered your email address and then continue and then you can register right but now I have already registered so I am just going to enter my email ID and just click login so see I have login here right now let me just show you now you can just click on get started this is the guided path for basics of java right so they are going to cover all the Java Basics and advanced concepts right now what they are going to cover they have 12 modules in this carried path C12 modules and what each module contains the first one is Introduction to Java notes plus problems six nodes 12 problems so first as introduction just click on that you will get notes Here Right see the notes then you click on this arrow and see the left you will get introduction additional Java the next is features and use of java and after that you will get questions jvm so for just click on First and you will get a first you will get the query part then see question mcqs what does GRE stands for then you can just enter and submit you can just select your answer and submit so these are some questions then again how to run a Java code this about main method see the theory part compile and run creating comments everything and then mcqs you will get see these are the mcqs write like this so first query part then sum problems mcqs on that right okay now back to home and let's see so this is the first module the next module is variables and data types same you will get eight nodes 20 problems so same the introduction right introduction Declaration of variables everything then variable naming convention then keywords in Java data types in Java see Java keywords first Java keywords the query and then mcqs invalid variable name this is the McQ just select the right answer and submit same like this data types here also first query then mcqs then scope of the variable in Java type casting overflow under flow in Java this is the second module variables and data types then input output in Java so taking in how to take user input in Java the theory part of this and then mcqs mcqs plus here you will get practice problems see the last will get practice problems so some programs find area of rectangle let's just click on print name and age so like this you will get this is a problem statement just read this sample input sample output read this understand this and here in the right section you can just write down your code so whatever Inuit language you are comfortable you can select like JavaScript Java python C plus plus any language you can select of your choice run this and submit right so some practice problems also you will get here right now back to home and this was our third module then operators in Java all the types of populators arithmetic unary assignment relational logical bitwise everything right so this is this is what so whenever you will click on any tab the theory part you will get right and then after that problems mcqs and practice problems right now after operators control statements in Java iteration statements like if else if for Loop and all jump statement and then practice problems as well so here are the programs right practice problems these are some practice problems some of some of even number till n some of un and or so these are five or six fine factorial local number practice problems same click on any problem and same you will get the same screen read this problem statement first what are the input output and then you can write down your code here you can select your language and just submit that right okay now we have methods in Java types of methods parameters method overloading then practice problems then memory allocation then arrays strings then oops Concepts in Java package access specifier classes and objects static keyword final keyword Constructor in Java this and super keyword in Java encapsulation inheritance polymorphism abstractions all those Concepts Theory plus problems then exceptional handling right find that try catch and throw and this finally Block in Java then collection Java at last why we use collection in Java then like Java collection framework hierarchy mcqs collection algorithms and then example problems see you can see example problems right answer plus explanation so first of all you will get what is the output of the following program you can just try it out answer also you will get here and then explanation also so some examples problems as well okay so these are all 12 modules and after completing this course 80 percent see eighty percent completion of this course you will get you can download the certificate freely without any penalty but for that you have to complete this course 80 percent right part of this challenge you just go go through this one log in and go through this one and at last you will get the certificate as well as you will get some gifts rewards you can see top 10 winners will get some exciting coding images merchandise and some gift worth rupees twenty thousand twenty thousand right and if you have any other question you can go to the frequently Asked question and you can just check out this thing right so I hope this is a great way to utilize your summer breaks if you are interested in learning coding or any programming language like Java right so all the relevant links and details you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out so now we'll see in the next video till bye take care
