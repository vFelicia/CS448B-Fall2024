so in the series of learning Python programming languages in the previous video we have seen what are F strings right so now we'll see when coding exercise in this video what is the program you have to write down a program to find out how many days weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old right so first understand this problem what should be the input your current age now output should be what it should print a message something like this you have like eight days B weeks and C months left in this format only you should print the output and ABC are what obviously you will calculate right using that using some logic or some formula right actual values you have to write down here rather than ABC now for your calculation you have to assume the standard thing is one year 365 days one year is equal to 52 weeks and one year equal to 12 months just exclude that leap year right we will assume this thing only for calculation for writing this program right I hope you go now now you have to take age using input function like function you have to use and from user you will take input right now let's suppose the video and try out this program okay so I hope you have done this now let's create a file coding exercise fifth okay dot py now first of all we'll take input age using input function okay input and we will write down enter your age okay now obviously using input function if you take input that would be string and you have to convert that obviously age into H would be 10 20 30 40 50 like this so we convert that into int right so yeah one question was there while taking input can we uh Typecast this can we write down the skin here can we type cast this yes we can do this that was asked in one of the comment on previous videos so yeah you can directly type passed this thing into int while you taking input rather than in next line right so now the age will be integer form in form now how many years left suppose one variable I'm taking years left is equal to I have told you uh we you know let's just suppose we live until 90 years old so 90 minus your current age obviously so 90 minus h fine now we have got ears now directly very simple we can find out how many days left months and weeks right so let's find out how many days years like how many years left years left into 365. because one year equal to 365 days right how many months years left into 12 1 year is equal to 12 months and what about weeks years left into 52 because one year is equal to 52 weeks we suppose so yeah now we have got days months and weeks left now you just have to print the message right if you want to check out this thing is correct or not let me just print something rather than the actual thing let me just print days left let's just print this thing and see it is working correctly or not so enter your age this I'm entering suppose 85. 1825 because 85 means 5 years 5 into 365 would be one eight two five right okay now it is printing now let's just print the exact output so for matting we have to use because we will print you have X like ABC days like this so you have a string and these number of days are integer so we will you have to type cast that thing if you don't use x string so just prefix this with f uh double quotes or single quotes whatever you want to use and let's just print the message as it is you have first of all what we have to print you have a days so rather than a days we days underscore left days comma weeks and B weeks B weeks means weeks underscore left and weeks then and see months so rather than see the value is in which variable once left months left that's it right so these values these expression would be replaced with their values at runtime let me just run this and show you enter your age 85 oh sorry let me just run this again because see I have put this while entering this slash so that is why this is value error invalid literal for INT right because this is value error another type of error is value error let's run this again 85 see you have 1825 days 260 weeks and only 60 months left five years means months how many months 60 months only so like this you can find out how many days you have left right so that was one coding exercise to find out your life in weeks right and I hope you got how to use app strings now in your program so I hope you got how to write down this program so from the next video we'll start what are control statements in Python we'll see like if else basically what is if and what is if else in the next video with the help of a program right so now it's in the next video bye take care
