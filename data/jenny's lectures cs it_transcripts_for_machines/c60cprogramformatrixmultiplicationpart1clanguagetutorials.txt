so in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing some programs on matrix we have discussed what in the previous video ah addition of two metrics so in this video we will discuss multiplication of two matrix and we will print that multiplication right so see first of all we will just you know try to understand the logic behind multiplication the theory behind this some rules you have to take care while you are going for multiplication of two metrics and then we will see the logic we will write on that program and then we'll see practically on my laptop but before that just want to tell you one thing whether you are preparing or will be preparing for software development roles at top product companies an academy subscription can be perfect companion and guide for you why do i say that because you will get best in class educators from the companies like amazon google and other such top companies where you guys want to work these educators will take live and interactive classes where all your concepts will be cleared and your doubts will be solved in real time so you can leave every class with a good outcome the course and curriculum has been designed by the experienced people from the industry who have been working in the companies like linkedin google amazon and other such top companies and have cleared many interviews that you want to in future in addition to all these you get on demand doubt support on discord where you can ask your doubts if you missed asking them in live class here you will get courses on everything including system design full stack back and end data structure and algorithm and in case if you have missed any live class because of your busy schedule it's okay you have option to watch recording of the classes so while you have option to choose to choose a three six or twelve month subscription i guess a 12 month subscription will be you know make more sense because it just cost 90 rupees per day and you you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 extra discount on your paid subscription see it's not like that just read the no statement what program you have to do and start writing a program first of all understand the program the logic behind that no try to write down the program with your hand with a pen or pen or paper rather than just directly jump to your laptop right so first of all we will see that thing only so two metrics these are two metrics we are going to multiply these metrics and the resultant matrix try to understand the dimension of this resultant matrix what would be the dimension it would be three into three first of all let me clear uh you know let me just do the multiplication how that is to be done after that we will discuss one by one all the rules and the size of this matrix why you are getting that size and everything will discuss the conditions and all we are taking both both matrix 3 into 3 how multiplication will be done the index would be 0 1 2 0 1 2 these are rows and these are columns so first row first of all we will find out value which would be stored here at the resultant matrix right so first row we will take first row of the first matrix and this first column of second matrix right means 0th row of first matrix and 0th column of second matrix and we are going to multiply 1 into 1 1 into 1 plus then second element 5 second element of this column 5 into 0 plus 6 into 1 so here the value will get would be 7 so that would be stored here 7 now for this one how you will get same 0th row but the column would be this one second column or you can say that column 1 i am representing column with index so how you will get 2 into 1 2 plus 5 into 1 5 plus 6 into 0 0 so here also you will get 7 now for this element same this row and now the column would be this one column of second matrix would be this one so 0th row and second column 3 plus 1 3 plus 5 plus 5 25 plus 6 into 2. 12 and here it would be 40 right now for this one see the size of this would be 3 into 3 y 3 into 3 the size of resultant matrix would be we'll take rows of first matrix rows are 3 into columns of second matrix columns are 3 that will be size of the resultant matrix right so here i guess you are clear why size is 3 into 3 right so now 0 1 2 here rows index would be 0 1 2 column index 0 1 2 now what is going to be stored here index for this is what 1 and 0 1 and one at one throw and zeroth column so to get a value for this we will take first this this row i mean row one of first matrix and this 0th column of second matrix means 2 into 1 2 plus 2 into 0 0 plus 5 into 1 5 and here it would be 7. right for this one index for this is what 1 and 1 right so 1 and 1 so you can relate it something like this 1 means row one of first matrix and another one is what column one of second matrix we are going to multiply this and we are going to add two into two four plus two into one two plus five into zero 0 it would be 6. now this is what index for this is what 1 and 2 1 and 2 it means row 1 first matrix and column would be now second second of this matrix so 2 into 3 6 plus 5 into 2 10 plus 5 into 2 10 so that would be 26 now we have to find out value for this now so index for this is what 2 and 0 so now for the first we will take row second of first matrix and we'll multiply this row with zeroth column of c 0 is a zeroth column of second matrix so here you will get 1 into 1 so these are the values you are getting right now the rule is what if you want to multiply 2 metrics then must have condition is what columns of first matrix must be equal to rows of second matrix here columns of first matrix are what columns are 3 and rows in second matrix are what 3 both are equal so you can multiply this if matrix is something like this 2 into 3 here we are having 2 rows we are not having this row and 3 columns and this is of 3 into 3. now we cannot multiply directly you have to print you cannot multiply these metrics see columns why you cannot multiply if i am going to remove this now this is a matrix now why you cannot multiply see the reason this this matrix would be of size dimension would be you will take rows of first matrix and columns of second matrix so 3 into 3 so that should be 3 into 3 size right now 3 to 3 means this one we have to find out 9 values so for this we will multiply for this subscript 4 this is 0 0 so we'll multiply this row 0 through this column right one with this one five with zero but six with one here we have nothing it's not like that you can directly write one into one plus five into zero plus only six no you must have something to multiply with the six but here we don't have anything because this is having only two rows that is why it's not possible to multiply these metrics so for multiplication columns of first matrix must be equal to rows of second matrix right because of this logic because of this means how we are getting the uh you know the elements of resultant matrix right because we are going to multiply the columns here what this this these are columns and we are going to multiply this with this one so these are rows of second matrix that is why one two three columns so the row should be three so that you can get multiplication exit you have something to multiply with the six i hope you got the condition now right so now one question for you is so before asking questions let me just um you know somewhere in generalized form it is written what if matrix one is a having m rows n column second matrix is b having p and q b rows and q columns and if you want to multiply these metrics then only the condition is if this number of columns of this a equal to equal to number of rows of second matrix that is p then only you can multiply right otherwise we cannot multiply so we have to put in a while we write a program we will also put this condition if this condition is true then only will multiply if this condition is not true then you directly have to print sorry we cannot multiply these matrix right and the size of resultant matrix would be if this is the case then size of resultant matrix would be m into q rows of first matrix columns of second matrix so now the question is this i want to multiply this can you multiply this matrix and if we multiply these two matrix then what would be the size of c is suppose resultant matrix what would be the size here that you have to tell me in common box and second question is if i am having a matrix something like this a is 2 into 3 and b is 3 into 2 can we multiply this and if we can multiply then find the size of the resultant matrix so this is part one of metric matrix multiplication into the next part we will discuss we will draw it in the program here we will discuss the logic here and practically i will show you the output of that matrix multiplication program on my laptop right if because if i i'll do in the you know same lecture then this video will be very lengthy so i'll see you in the next video till then bye bye take
