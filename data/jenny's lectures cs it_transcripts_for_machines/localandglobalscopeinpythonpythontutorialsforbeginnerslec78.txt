that was our sixth project in the series right now we are discussing in this video a very simple topic but it's crucial one that is what is local scope and Global scope right I hope if you have you know you have done many other programming languages you have heard these things local scope Global scope blog scope namespaces and all right so mainly in this video we'll be discussing local versus global scope as well as block scope write three things fine now before moving to this concept let me just tell you one story okay so during my schooling days we used to you know go out to play and there was a house or you can see house plus Garden so so in that Garden like there were two rooms one or two rooms and they are in this area they were having multiple trees so one tree is of like those fruits I don't know what you call them but we used to call them bear small fruits the right one is are red one and sweet taste and the green one as unripe green one are unripe brand with sore taste so one tree was inside this boundary I mean inside their house and no one was allowed to enter and you can say pluck fruits from this tree right those beer and one only the family members can you know eat those fruits from this tree and one the same tree was at this boundary so we used to go to this tree like and pluck those fruits from this tree either using some stick or throw stones and something like this and so see from this tree anyone was allowed to pluck those fruits right pick fruits from this tree but no one was no Outsider was allowed to enter in this house and you can say like pick fruits from this tree from this one yeah we used to do this thing like uh we were checking like if there is nobody in the house then quickly we enter in the house and whatever roots are falling from the tree on the ground we used to pick and to be uh run but that was a different story legally no one was allowed to enter and pick fruits from that tree right so see why I am telling you this story so what we can see in terms of programming this tree is having local scope this is local too these members like the only family members are allowed to pick fruits from this tree and this tree was having global scope so this is global anyone was allowed to pick fruits from this tree same in programming also we are having this thing right so in programming we use we used to declare some variables with some names and we use to declare functions where we will have classes and many other things right so in functions variables classes are having their own name right so now you understand the scope of the name or the variable in your code depends on where depends on what depends on the place where you create that variable so means see the scope of this tree is local and scope of this tree is global why so because only the difference is trees same fruits are also same the place where the trees are you can see harvested something like this right so scope is simply that thing the area in which you can use those variables or you can say those names or functions or those classes right let me just do this thing with the help of a program let's take one example I hope general idea you got what is local scope what is global scope with help of this example so let's define a function suppose I am defining a function simply display and within this display function I'm having a variable a is equal to 10. and I'm just printing this a and we are calling this this one so see this you can say this is boundary so this is you can say home for this a only the members for the family members of this function only can use this variable a means this a is having local scope within this function only you can use this a if you want to print this a outside outside of this house then it will throw an error right because this a is having local scope if outside of any function in the main body of the Python code if you are declaring a variable a is equal to 10. now this variable is having global scope this is block variable so now this will print 10 and this will print also 10. suppose let's differentiate it it is 15. so this will print 15 and this will print 10. right I hope in programming in terms of programming also you got the difference between local and Global scope right okay it will be more more clear to you guys when we take one example so let's do practical okay so let's create a new file here scope of variable load p y now we take first of all a global variable right so this variable the variable you define in this scope the global scope is available in all your code throughout your code right and this variable is created outside of any function or anything in the main body of the python python code so this is having global scope now we are defining a function suppose this the function name is display we are not passing anything yet within this also I am having the same variable name a but the value is 15. so I'm going to print a here right and let's call this display so let's run this which which value would be printed for this a this a is within this function because this is indented the intent indented block this is what a function block so this a is having this variable is having we can say local soap and this is outside of any function then this is having Global spoke now let's run this and see what output you will get here it's 15. right so this a first of all it will search if there is any local variable a yes so it will print 15 but if suppose we are not having this C I'm just printing a here so is it possible for this function to access the global variable yes it is possible let's run this C 10. so a global variable the global variable or the variable which is having global scope that can be accessed from within the function as well now if we comment out this e and we are having this say only right and I want to print a outside also right so I'm not having this a I'm on a I'm having a only within this function so this is having local spoke let's run this C first of all our name error name a is not defined in line number six in line number six this a is not defined because this a is outside of this function we are accessing this outside of this function so it cannot access the local variable the variable which is having local scope it will search for a variable a having global scope or there is no variable so it will your name error but this a would be printed 15. as python is an interpreted language so line by line it will be executed right so first display right then obviously it will print this is same but the the error is in this line only so in this line it will print error and 15 would be displayed I hope now you go to what is difference between Global and local scope right so but the thing is if within this one more thing if we are having a nested function suppose I am having one more function show but this within this display function right and here I am printing this print K and I'm calling display so what do you think it will give an error or because within this function I'm not you can say declaring any variable a outside of this function I am having a variable a right so what it will access this a or this a let's see okay so it is printing only 10 I mean this print is executed because this print is not been executed because we are not calling this show function we are calling only display right so to make this happen to print this say you have to call this function show right okay let's update this thing so within this display function only within this display only you have to call this show function because this show is local to this display right let's run this now let's comment out this line see it is printing 15 because this a will access first of all it will see within this function there is is there any locally no then next this function is within this function so it will search is there any a within this function yes a is 15 so it will print this if you comment out this line then it will search if there is any Global a so it will print 10. right and directly you cannot call this show here right outside of this display we cannot call this show I am calling this outside of this display this this uh block let's run this it will give you error see the name show is not defined so you can call this show function within this display only because this is local to this this display right so whatever you will Define within this display function whether it's a class or a function or a variable you can use that thing within this display only right like this a this a within this display or with this show function within this display only so the show is also having local scope like now one more thing we have a block scope but in Python there is no such scope in other languages like C C plus plus if if we write down something like this if we write down any if or 4 or while loop then those are also having their scope that is known as block scope whatever you will write within that for Loop any variable then that variables are having block slope right or within any if else if statement also you define declare any variable that also having block slope but in Python there is no such slope only local and Global let me just clear this thing with help of an example suppose uh any simple example we can take I am having two variable five and six so the condition I am putting like if a less than b then C is equal to a plus b right and outside of this if I am printing the C C this A and B these variables are having global scope it's okay we can use these variables in throughout our code right but the C is within this if so maybe you are thinking the C is having block scope as this is having like in other languages so the C we can use only within this if block not outside of the zip so the Sprint will give error but no let's run this it will print 11. right so there is no block scope whatever you will write like within this F or for Loop while loop those variables are if you are using this if while or for Loop within a function then obviously those variables are local to that function local scope but if you are using if something like this not within any function simply in your program so the C is having a this variable is having global scope you can use this throughout the code so there is no block scoping python is it clear but see if you use something like this if I say this this if a this is within this display function and now you want to print this C here now let's see it will give error this name c is not defined because now the C is local to this function now the C is having local scope right so it depends in which you are using this F4 or Y Loop if within a function then obviously those variables are harming local scope to that function if not inside the function then they are having global scope so I hope the basics or you can say it's clear to you guys local scope Global scope and block scope right and why basically the this concept the scope concept or you can say basically this is what name spaces right so that thing will be discussing in a Separated video what is a namespace different types of namespace why you need namespace right so maybe next video will be discussing this thing so now we'll see the next video till then bye take care
