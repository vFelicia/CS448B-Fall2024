so in the series of learning python programming language in this video we'll talk about history of python in previous video we have talked about like some features of python why it is so popular and uh the application of python application areas in which areas python is being used these things we have discussed in this video we'll talk about the who is creator of python why he invented this why he created this when how where what is the motto behind designing of this language and the words and history of this language right all these things we'll talk about in this video so actually creator or you can say a designer of python languages it's he's a dutch programmer guido vandross he started working on this project in actually in 1989 during his christmas holidays right and at that time he was working in cwi centrum viscandi and informatica center at that time and on a project a distributed operating system ameba at that time he was working on that project and in his early 1980s he had worked on a programming language abc abc programming language so he was having some experience of working on a programming language or designing of a programming language like which factors for which you need to take care while you design a new language like some features and all these things so he was having some experience of this thing right so he had worked on the abc programming language and he was also working in sea also you know during the during his project of distributed operating system distributed operating operating system right so he was having some experience about this thing and so during you know in his christmas holidays as a hobby project he started working on this project on you can say designing of a new language so he took some features from abc programming language or you can say python is a successor of abc programming language you know he really liked some features of abc programming language and yeah there are some features i know he didn't like those features right but he took some features from that language and fix all the flows which was there in that language and added some new features and designed a new language within three months he had worked on this project with you know for three months only and he designed a new language so you can say new scripting language named python and why he named this language as python because at that time you know he was a fan of a british tv series named monty python's flying circus it was a comedy series right comedy series type of thing so that series is also known as monty pythons so he was fan of that thing so he took the name from that tv series python he wanted a new name unique name you know out of league name something different something different so he took that name python but python is not inspired from java many students think that like now object oriented programming concept the hoop concepts was taken from java no actually the idea of designing of python came up in 1989 and for java it was in 1995 right so it's way before java it is taken from you can say he was having some experience of c language also then abc programming language as well as exceptional handling concept was not there in abc programming language and abc a language was not extensible you know they are not able to add new features in that programming language and during the working of working on projects you know he thought that he was you know facing some issues and all so it was not a he was not able to extend abc programming language new features were not added that is why he you know designed a new language and exceptional handling concept was taken the idea of this concept basically taken from modular language right so you can say python is inspired from abc as well as my modular language so he took some features from abc one feature from modular language by exception handling and designed a new scripting language and after three months he showed his work this kind of thing in you know his office and they started working even actually they started using that scripting language scripting language means just you can write down a script or some code to automate some task manually you don't need to do that task to automate some task of existing system you can you know write down a script a small script small code so they started using it they started you know doing improvement in that thing so uh in 1994 primary discussion forum was formed for python and it was an open source project you know godo decided to keep it as open source so that anybody can use it and contribute in this source code just for its improvement right they can also add some features and all to improve that programming language and finally in 19 in feb 1991 first version was released that was known as 0.9.0 having some features of like classes inheritance exceptional handling and some primitive like data types list dictionaries strings these things but official version of this the first version 1.0 was released in 1991. in 1991 1.0 official version was released with some extra features like lambda map reduce filter and then after that 1.1 1.2 like this still 1.6 updated version fixing of some flows and all added of new features and all then version 2.0 was released in 2000 following by the versions 2.1 2.3 like this till 2.7 in 2010 but they have announced that on january 1st of january 2020 they have announced that they are going to end the support for this version 2.x version they are not going to support this version anymore right so now recently version is three point x version so basically first of all version 3.0 came into picture in 2008 then 3.1 3.2 something like this and the latest version is 3.10 which was released in 2021 so we are going to work on this version only the latest version 3.10. you will download this thing python 3.10 right that will uh see next video how to install and set up everything to you know work on this language to write down programs and 3.11 will be released i guess in this this year only 2022 in october and next year future releases 3.12 in 2023 so this is all about a small history of python that's all you need to take care basically who is designer of this language and we are in netherlands he was he is sorry he was not he is a dutch programmer he is still alive okay in netherlands he you know designed this language so that is all about history of python now in the next video we will in download python that interpreter and as well as the ide and we'll start using those things so now in the next video till then bye take care
