so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing file handling in c we have discussed all the file opening modes like read write append r plus w plus a plus mode now we are left with some special function in c uh special function in file handling that is fc rewind f10 so in this video we'll talk about fc function so these function play a very important role in random access of a phi right so this will see about fc function what is this function why we use this function how to use this function in your program at everything every single detail about this function will see in this video with the help of a program i'll show you practical also right now before that just want to ask one thing how many of you are appearing for gate 2020 to exam i'm sure it is most of you guys so that is why i am here with some interesting and very important news for you guys geeks for geeks has introduced a gate cso india mode 3 which is a simulation of the actual examination format as we always say practice is the key so appearing for this mo will definitely boost up your confidence and definitely it will help you in improving your weak points this test consists of complete syllabus and the question pattern of gate 2022 it is going to have mcqs msqs and net numerical type of questions it will help you to understand your strong points and your weakness so that you know accordingly you can prepare for your gate exam and you will get familiar with the examination pattern and mode and most importantly you can take the smoke test free of post it will be on 29th of january and it will be live for 24 hours for more information and instruction you can go to the link which i'll put in the description box of this video so to take this examination what you have to do you just have to register the registration link i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let us see what is fc function see suppose we have a file abc dot txt and in this file i have suppose this i have in my file so now fc function is going to move why we use this function to move the cursor the file pointer to a specific position right now what does that mean suppose i want to read from this file i want to read only this khatri is awesome not jen but when you open this file in read mode the cursor would be in the beginning but i i don't want to read this jenny i want to read from here so first of all you are supposed to move the cursor from here to here and then till end of the file you can read you can write down the logic when you can write down the while loop so for moving this cursor from here to here which function we will use fc right means we are moving the cursor to a specific position right like rewind function is used to move the cursor from end to beginning or maybe the cursor is from cursor is here so if you use rewind function that would be moved from here to here from any position to beginning rewind is used for that that also will discuss with the program but fc is to move the cursor to a specific position right now suppose cursor is here and now i move to i want to move this cursor from here to here from here to here so now cursor is not in the beginning cursor is to a specific position so from here also you can move the cursor to this position or maybe from the end also you can cursor is here and you want to move the cursor from here to here so that also you can do right everything we will discuss with the help of fc you can do all these things right and you can update also suppose rather than jenny khatri or some faculty rather than khatri here i want to write like jenny uh lamba that also you can do right you can update this file with the help of fc function right just you you are supposed to take care of the opening mode in which mode you are opening this file right everything you can do so main thing is to move the cursor to a specific position we use fc function right now what is the syntax of writing this function just write down fc three argument it will take first would be file pointer right next would be offset and next would be position or origin anything you can say three uh arguments are there so obviously file pointer the data type is file for offset the data type is long end and for position the data type is hint and the rear type of this function the return type is end it will return 0 if successful successfully it has updated the file pointer otherwise it will return a nonzero value right now file pointer obviously which file pointer is pointing to this file that you will write here offset means how many bytes you want to move that that cursor how many bytes you want to move right from the particular position suppose from here i want to move to khatri so how many one two three four five six space is also so six would be offset that is what offset how many bytes you want to move forward or backward if you want to move forward then positive value you will write if you want to move backward then you will write a negative value right position means from which position you want to add the offset means you want to move the cursor from the beginning or from a particular position or from end from which position you want to move you want to skip the content right so this position is going to have three values like seek underscore set these are predefined function right this is already defined in stdio.h you are supposed to include this file seek set it means the position is beginning of the file seek underscore c u r means current position of the file pointer current position of file pointer from the current position of file pointer i want to move maybe backward or forward this means from the beginning i want to move right from the beginning obviously we will move forward and if you want to move from the end seek end underscore end means end of the file from the end of the file position is end of the file and from end of the file i want to move from here to backward you can move right so how you will use these three you know position here and how you will write how to use this fc function in your program i'll show you this with the help of a program right so just obviously we are supposed to declare a file pointer first i am declaring this with null and i am going to open this f open and the name of the file is abc dot txt and i'm opening this in read mode simple because my main motto is to you know help you to understand what is fc function you can try out this fc function with any mode r w a r plus w plus a plus but you know in every mode it is going to show some different result so that you need to try yourself right once you get what is fc function you can do this these variations you can do know these kind of you know things with this fc function you can try out different different with different different modes but i am opening right now in this read mode only read mode right so just you you are supposed to check first if this f p is equal to is equal to null means simply you can print cannot open file and exit that's it otherwise if you are opening this in read mode then the cursor would be from here in the beginning all right now index would be this one 0 then 1 then 2 then 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 like this space is also having an index right what you will do if suppose from khatri from here i want to read khatri is awesome i don't want to read jenny only khatri is awesome so first i'll move this cursor from here to here to sixth position right so what you will write f c file pointer is fp i am taking offset what you will write six how many one two three four five six six byte you want to skip and here you want to move so offset would be six this we are going to add c i will show you and the position is c underscore from starting seek underscore set this is for starting right means in this position i want to add this one so current position is this one that is 0 0 plus i want to add 6 is equal to 6 so now cursor would be at this position at sixth index here and at sixth index i have k so suppose a single character if i want to read here using f get c and f p and simply i am going to print printf percentage c ch before using this cs i i yes i am supposed to declare this so what it will print k because now using f seek we have moved the cursor to this position and now k would be printed now i hope you got this right if you want to modify this obviously if you want to write something to this position then you you are supposed to open this in maybe w mode or r plus mode or w plus mode right that also you are supposed to try but that thing will give different different results right now see after using f get c now it is printing k and now the cursor is moved to here now file pointer is here at seventh index like at h so now if suppose you want to move this three position backward i want to print y one character why right so how you can move simply you can write down f seek fp and now backward means minus you will write minus 3 and here you will write fc underscore cur from the current position i want to move not from beginning now from the current position so for that we have c dot c 1 and now if you will print f get c c h is equal to and if you in print f simply you will write percentage c c h what it will print after using f get c the cursor moved to here now minus 3 minus 3 means now you can say you can write down like this at seventh index we have h minus three this offset you are supposed to add in this position minus three means minus three plus if you will do plus minus three obviously that will be minus three seven minus three is equal to four now at fourth position we have y so it would print y i hope now you got this after printing this y now obviously cursor would be moved to the next position here at the space now cursor is here at fifth index right now from the end suppose i want to print like this oh i want to print from the end from here also you can move from the current position also from the beginning also you can move enough but i want to know write down the third variant that is f seek fp minus 3 and seek underscore end and suppose here you right if you write this thing c h is equal to f get c and you will print character then minus three means from here minus three one two three minus three so o would be printed so it will print o if you will do is use here f get c ch and you will print that ch then it will print o right so if you want to move the cursor to a specific position you can use fc these are the three variant you can use using set using see you are using end this is a simple example of just i'm opening the file in read mode right now after moving this cursor here you can update this also right suppose if you are opening this file in r plus mode that is also for reading and writing so you can do that thing but if you write w plus more means the previous content would be erased so here it would create some problem right obviously if you are moving this cursor from to the sixth offset and you are printing nothing would be printed because once you open this and w plus more the previous content would be erased so what it will print nothing but in r plus mode it can print because previous content would be as it is right so this you need to take care and obviously you are familiar with these modes so according to that you can modify your program right if you want me to upload any video on a specific mode like you supposed to use fc function in r plus mode or w plus mode or a plus mode then you can tell me in command dose i'll make a complete video and i'll show you that with help of a program now let me show you practical of this program so let's create a new file fc dot c right and i'm just going to copy this this content because this would be same right so it will save our time right now abc don't take time i'm opening this in read mode only right and in abc dot txt suppose i have jenny kathryn is or some fake ld right now enough i left out c now what we will see first of all i am going to move the cursor right fc fb and offset i am taking 6 only and position i am taking what fc underscore set means from the starting from the beginning i want to move so if you want to read the complete file from the sixth offset to complete then you can just write down a while loop that i hope you can do but let us suppose i am just reading a single character just to you know clear the function of this fc i'm reading a single character right the position so sorry this you will write and i am just printing this and before using this obviously ch w we have declared and then f close fp that's it right so what it will print see let me just run this and show you the output see it is printing k right it is printing k 6 offset 6 position from beginning it is going to 6 character 6 byte is it is going to skip and after that it will print that is k it is going to print right now suppose uh if after that i'm writing this same i'm going to copy right and now i'm writing minus 3 minus 3 3 step backward 3 bite backward i want to move the cursor from the current position right so seek underscore c u r current right and now just print the character what it will print it will print k as well as y see it is printing ky let me just uh know format this with the slash and now let me run this see first is k then it is printing y first is k then three step backward and it will print y why it is printing why because after f get c function the cursor is at which alphabet h i have described this in the video and now three position backward means it is printing y right now let me just use the third variant also that minus three from end from e and d from end position right so now what it will print first it is printing it will print k then y then l see l it is printing right let me just show you the file from the end minus 3 means 1 2 3 that is l it is printing so now i hope the basic function of this f c is clear to you with this read mode right if you are going to add something right suppose i am opening this file in let me show our plus mode it is worth for reading and writing right and it is not going to erase the previous content so that would be as it is so now suppose i am writing at sixth position after moving this let me just comment everything out and after moving to sixth position f put s i am i know at sixth position i want to update that thing whatever is written with high so comma f p semicolon control s right that's it so it is not going to print anything on the screen it will print the that file also in that file right now i have jenny khatri is also faculty now after running this program what would be the content of this file let me just show you see on the screen it is not going to print anything because i am not reading anything from the file so see it is printing jenny then h i kh has been replaced by the character h i then everything would be same so if you want to update a specific that file from a specific position just move the cursor to that position just open the file in r plus mode and then move the position to the specific position from where you know at which you want to update the content and then you can write down so now hi would be written at which offset sixth after six two uh character it will add hi hi i hope now you got this this is how you can update the file also but if you will open this file in wplus mode then the previous content would be erased then how it is going to move the cursor right so that you can do yourself right that is assignment for you guys if you open the file in wplusmodo wmod if you open the file in a mod append mode or a plus mode then what it will do that is your assignment you have to practice that thing so i hope now this is clear to you so i hope the main motive of this fc function is clear to you guys and don't forget to register for the gate all india mock test the link would be in the description box so now i'll see in the next video till then bye bye take care
