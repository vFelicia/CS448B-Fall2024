so in the series of learning objectoriented programming in c plus in the previous video we have installed our vs code an id visual studio code the compiler we have configure visual studio code the compiler we have set path and all and we have also checked by running a simple program just to print hello world on the screen and yeah it was working so our laptop is all set now we can write down our programs and we can run c plus programs and we can run right now from the this from this video we are going to discuss like the theory thing as well as practical also right so the very first thing is what c plus is an object oriented programming language it's not purely object oriented but yeah it follows the object oriented programming those concept of oops so that is why it is objectoriented programming right but first of all before starting to see plus plus like basics of c plus plus let me just discuss what is object oriented programming what is this and see what we have discussed c language so now what c language programming language follows is it objectoriented programming or if not then what it is right processor oriented programming now what is this procedure oriented programming these are programming paradigms now what is this paradigm these things basic things we will discuss in this video will differentiate processor oriented programming and object oriented programming the main main difference we will see right so the basic detail will discuss about objectoriented programming right how this is different from pop the main reason right so this object oriented programming it is just a programming paradigm what is this programming paradigm paradigm means it's just a method to solve a particular problem right programming paradigm means it is just a way or you can say a style of programming of doing of writing programs which style you follow right it's just a method or a style of for programming that is simple paradigm there are different different paradigms right imperative functional parallel under imperative uh two types of paradigm comes like uh procedure oriented and object oriented right so different different paradigms are there basically main are processor oriented paradigm procedure oriented programming and object oriented programming these two right these two comes under imperative imperative programming paradigm these two comes under this category imperative programming paradigm pop and oop in which we more focus on how to do the tasks rather than what to do right now what is this procedure oriented programming as the name suggest processor oriented means procedure means how to do a particular task right the steps or in this this computer or programming language terms we can call that algorithm so this would be oriented this would revolve around the procedure right main focus is on the algorithm how to do the task rather than what to do fine and procedure we can say procedure or function right same thing so in this case c comes under this category right c fortran pascal these comes under ah this p op or indeed programming right now see in this case we first think the system or the large project then we divide right so you can say your program is divided your program is divided you can say in multiple functions function one function two function three multiple functions can be there right or something like this you can write we have this main and this would be divided in multiple functions like function one function two function three and these function can further be divided like function four function five something like this so program is divided into parts that are known as procedure or function right now these these functions are interdependent you can say these functions are having their local data also local data as well as they share global data something like this we have so here we have local data as well as global data these are three functions for example every function is having its own local data ld means local data and gde means global data and each and every function can share global data in this pop programming paradigm we have global data and more focus is on global data right every function share more and more global data now the problem here is what so data movement is more so data is less secure in this case this function can update this data right also this function can also update this data so data would be less secure something like this we have you have kept some money in the locker in your house and suppose each and every person in your house can access that locker like uh every person maybe it's your maid or the gardener or your driver every person in your house your house may be considered as a large program and each an individual is function something like this and each and every can access that locker so is money safe there no anyone can withdraw money anyone can take money from that thing suppose i have put ten thousand in there and another person took five thousand still i think that there are ten ten ten thousand rupees right but there are now five thousand rupees only and suppose i need eight thousand so i think that there are ten thousand rupees let me just take money but when i see that there are only five thousand rupees so the money is not secure same data is not secure in procedure oriented programming this is the main reason you can say why we switch to object oriented programming right because the data security the security the security of data is more in that case here we focus on the algorithm how to do the task rather than the data but in object oriented programming we focus on more on the data rather than how to do the task fine and in this case although suppose and see scalability it is not well suited for one thing in which we need more security second thing large and complex scalable applications the applications which require actively updated and maintenance this approach is not suitable for those things because there are interdependency more and more interdependency among these functions many functions are there right many functions are there calling each and every function something like this so see the interdependency of the code if you update in any one function this could lead to the updation in any other function also right if you want to add something some new feature some new function that is also very complex because of the interdependency code expectation we you know call it scalability is also not there right security is not there fine so now why in oops we have security see general structure of this object oriented programming is what this we do something like we have data and we have function these would be wrapped into a single unit there in pop we have function 1 suppose function 2 and we have a data a b c and this is a program something like this we divide this but here we do what we separate these things we separate these things right we wrap up these things the data to the function so this data would be you can say updated by this function only so less communication would be there what would be the general no you can say the structure data plus function here also we have data plus function something like this and we wrap up these things and this complete is known as object this is known as object suppose object one object two one more object is there object three right so see we have wrapped up these things so the data movement would be less in pop data moment was more freely data can move from one function to other another function here yeah object can communicate with each other with the help of message passing how it could be done that will also discuss in later video suppose we have another object also here object three so they can communicate with message passing so in object now what is this object see object is you can say a real world entity something like this this marker is an object this whiteboard duster camera my bottle table bed these are objects right we are also objects like suppose we want to why we do programming because we it's not like that we just want to write the simple simple program just to add two numbers print hello world uh check number is even reverse or string no these are basics we are you know we used to get us familiar with the programming concepts with these basic programs ultimately what we want to do obviously we want to solve some tasks some problems related to real world like we are creating software hospital management system library management system shopping cart some ecommerce websites are there amazon flipkart so they are being created behind that there is a complex code in any programming language and to create to solve these kind of problems processor oriented programming this is not suitable for the complex and large scale applications because the main reason what is the data security so that's why we move to object oriented programming now object is what real world entity a real world entity we can you know represent this real world entity in the form of programming and this is known as object right like for a shopping cart that website customer object shopping cart is a customer sorry an object and what objects can be there like a product so in short we can say objects you know corresponds to the things which found in real world right so it is close to the real world problems fine to solve real world problems to represent the data which is actually present in the real world we use this concept object oriented programming and each object is having its own data or you can say the state and behavior attribute behavior see suppose employer is a class so object can be ram sham jenny these are different different objects of that class so every object is having its own attribute like height color weight right and these are the you can see attributes or the data or the state of the object right which we represent in the form of variables and another thing is behavior of the object behavior can be like behavior like i can code i can sleep can sleep can e can code so these are we we represent the behavior in the form of functions method in a class right class is just a blueprint in detail we'll discuss what is class and object and everything the main part of this video is just to get you familiar with object oriented program and how it is different from pop so how data security comes here another feature is your data security here we have excess specifiers means private public protected if you want that the data any nobody can access that data you can keep that data private so your data is secure if you want that only few person can access that data you can keep it protected if you want that some data is it's no harm if anybody can access that data so you can keep that data public so we have access specifier concept in oop that is why data is secure one thing in this case you can see the program is divided into parts which are known as objects and each object is having its own attribute so you can say state and behavior right and object and communicate through message passing right and here the code you reusability is also there because of inheritance one concept oops concept is inheritance so because of that thing we can reuse the code so productivity would increase rather than writing that code again and again we can reuse the same code fine in detail we will see what is inheritance right so here more focus is on these objects or you can say the data because we focus in this more on data security so more focus is on data rather than the algorithm right rather than how to do so these are some you can say difference between you can write down pop and oop i hope you got the basic idea about this thing if you are if you are still confused don't worry if you don't know abcdo coding or the oops obviously at first time it would be very confusing for you guys right because we have just i have just told you the theory you have no you know practical in front of you but later one by one we will cover these thing in detail once you write down code then you will be familiar with these concepts right so now this is some basic about oop in detail we will see the four pillars of objectoriented programming that is abstraction encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and the main concept is classes and objects obviously without classes and objects we cannot write down a program so those things also we'll discuss later right so i'll see the next video till then bye take care
