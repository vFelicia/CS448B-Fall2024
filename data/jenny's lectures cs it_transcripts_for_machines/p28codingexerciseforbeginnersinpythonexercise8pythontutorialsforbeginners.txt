so in the series of learning Python programming languages the previous video we have seen what was nested if yesterday feels and alif statements right plus one coding exercise we have seen how to calculate BMI and after calculating BMI you have to tell like you are underweight overweight or normal weight or like this right now one more exercise coding exercise for you is you have to write down a program to check whether a given number is Leap Year or note it is a little bit tricky one right now first of all you you have to know what is Leap Year and how to calculate this generally a year contains 365 design only pair contains 366 days 29 days in February right so how to calculate this is Leap Year or node if you know the formula the logic then I would suggest first of all write down the algorithm write down in the steps then convert that into flowchart and then try to write down a program right if you have written down the algorithm and you have drawn the flow chart then it would be very easy for you to convert these you know the flowchart into program but first understand the logic right you should like that just start writing program right first understand the problem the logic and all think the logic right and if you don't know if you know the logic how to find out how to check the layer is Leap Year not just pause the video is and try to write down the program if you don't know how to find out the given number is Leap Year node then let me just brief you see what we will do there are three to four steps first of all we'll check if the number is divisible by divisible by 4 completely evenly divisible by 4 right then it may be leap year we can't say it would be a leap year but it is if it is not divisible by 4 then definitely it would be not a leap year foreign if it is divisible by 4 then you have to check if yes then you have to check if the number is divisible by 100 if yes if yes then it may be a leap year we can't say definitely it would be a leap year but if no in this case if no then definitely not a leap year foreign then we will check if that is divisible by 400 if divisible by 400 then definitely leap year and if it is not divisible by 400 then not a leap year so this is the simple logic to find out a number is evenly divisible by 4 then it would be a leap year except it is evenly divisible by 100 unless it is completely divisible by individual by 400. I think that line is confusing for you so just forget that line and see this look this is the logic right now you can write down this in the form of you can say algorithm or the steps or just draw the flow chart so let me just draw the flowchart for you then you will get it better the logic better then we will write down program right so we check first divisible by 4 two cases can be there yes or no if it is no then not leap year directly we can say not a leap year if yes then again we will check divisible by 100 . there could be two cases yes two choices yes or no if this case if no then yes leap year right if this is the case divisible by 100 then again we will take one we'll take one more condition divisible by 400. obviously two choices two cases can be there yes or no if divisible by 400 is yes then leap year if digital by 400 is a no then not a leap year so I guess if you have written down that algorithm you can easily convert that in the flowchart so this is the flowchart right I hope you got when we will get leap year when you will get not a leap year so I guess now it would be easy for you to write down this thing in the form of program using IF else right if you have got the previous lectures yesterday if yesterday fails simply fails if and all right then you can easily convert this thing into program now just pause the video and try out this program so now let's create a new file let's say leap underscore a DOT p y so last from the user which year you want to check right you will take input using the input function input only I have converted that into int now you have the flowchart with you right first of all we'll check if that is divisible by 4 if here is completely divisible by 4 means there is there should be no remainder evenly division will bind there should be no remainder right so remainder you will check using which operator module operator year modulo 4 equal to equal to zero means that can be a leap year we cannot say but if it is not divisible by 4 then definitely it is not a leap year so for this if one else we write for this if if it is not divisible then definitely we can say not a leap year so we can write down print not leap year right now within this if what you will check see this else is for this if right now within this if now what you will check if this year is divisible by completely divisible by 100 with no remainder means more hundred equal to equal to 0. if this is true then it may be leap year you have to check on more condition but if it is not it is divisible by 4 completely divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. then it is a leap year you can check out in the flowchart so for this if in the else part you will write what else leap year yes for this if this is the else leap year but within this if this condition is true if it is completely divisible by 100 then once again we'll check condition if here is completely divisible by 400. means with no remainder remainder is zero that to find out remainder views modulo operator now for this if if it is divisible by now in this case uh 400 then yes leap year otherwise not a leap year so for this if in else we write not leap year so I hope you got if you got the flowchart you can easily write down this logic but I am not saying you can only write down this thing like that logic in this way only if if we fail since there are multiple ways also Alternatives also you can write down this logic in other ways right like maybe first of all you will check if the ear not completely divisible by zero then it is not a leap year else in else part we can check these conditions so there are multiple ways this is one of the way but whatever the logic that you need to follow that you need to write down correctly now let me just run this program and I'll show you the output so the ER which are you want to check suppose 2023 not a leap year because it is not divisible by four first of all we'll check this thing not divisible by four completely divisible by 4 then will not go into this if and in else part of you will go not a leap year let's run this and again check for the year suppose 1900. it is divisible by 4 yes but it is still not a leap year it is divisible by 4 condition true we will enter here the individual by hundred yes that is also true completely divisible by 100 again enter in this case it then check divisible by 400 no remainder is not 0. so for this if condition is not true so we'll go into this else part and not a leap year so 1900 is not a DPF so any area you can check here suppose you want to check two zero two four next year that would be a leap year right and if you want to tell you then you can go to the calendar and you can check if the in February we have 29 days then that is a leap year right so I hope you ordered this exercise if not if you haven't got the program then please watch the video again first you know understand the logic the steps the algorithm then the flowchart understand this flowchart then again convert this into a program do not just skip okay you are not getting two to three times you have tried not getting let's jump to the next lecture no this is very simple one right so please take some you can say you can take some break 10 to 15 minutes then come back to this and again write down this program and try to understand the logic and the program right so now in the next video we'll see multiple if statements with the help of Onyx advice and also the next video we'll learn bye take care
