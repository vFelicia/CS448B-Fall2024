in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing about control statements in c in the previous videos i have discussed if statement and fl statements complete means the in detail from the the structure of those if and if else statements with the program we have discussed how to use those statements and some you know what kind of questions can be formed using if and if else statements and what errors you uh you can do the beginners can do while writing those statements in program so everything we have discussed about those statements now in this video i'll be talking about nested if statements everything about nested if general syntax of writing nested how to use this statement the structure of the nested if using flowchart as well as we will take a program and we'll see the output of that program when in that program we are going to use nested if statement so everything will be will be discussing in this video about a nested so now let us discuss about nested if it is what nesting of if means within if we can use another if like this there is one f what is the syntax of writing if here we are writing some conditions right and if the condition is true then the control will go within this if blow so within this if again we can write another if suppose here i am writing condition 1 and condition 2 again if you want to write again you can write here if condition 3 if condition 4 like this up to n it's not like that you can only write 2 if nesting if you can do multiple you know you can write multiple if means one if within if then in this one more if then in that one more if like this so i'm writing just two f just to make you understand and now inner if block statement this i am considering as outer if this i am considering as inner if right i am just taking a 2 if you can take multiple if also so now if this condition 1 is true then only control will go in this block and then only this condition would be checked and if this condition is true then control will go within this if block and these statements would be executed i am writing this curly braces because i am writing here inner if block statements means multiple statements if one statement is there then you can remove you can remove these curly braces right and it's not like that you can only write f here with this f you can also write else right and here you can write inner else block statement that's it and now you can close this f right and after that this is if with this if you can write else for this f right and here you can write down some you can say outer else block statements and after this if else block suppose i am writing in a program you can say statement suppose i am writing x right so now what is the working of this see you can write down this multiple if you know in many ways if you will not write this else you can skip the cells you can simply write if and only if means one if no else and here also you can skip this cell that is also fine or you can write down else and here also for this if you can write down else that is uh fine you can write down this nesting of f in multiple ways right or you can call it nested if else because i am writing if else within this fl block so now this condition would be checked only if this condition is true if this condition is false then control will not go within this block within this if block and directly control will go to this else blue right like you can take that example if you go to supermarket then what if oranges are available by oranges this condition you can write down in if block like like this if like this if go to supermarket then again check if orange is available buy oranges right if you don't go to supermarket then obviously you cannot check the oranges are available or not in the supermarket for that you have to go to supermarket so that is why to execute to check this condition first of all this condition should be true you have to go to supermarket then only you can check orange these are available or not or within this if again you can write one more if like if suppose good oranges then only buy right otherwise no need to buy so for this opening curly braces this is closing for this this is closing and for this this is closing brakes braces this mistake generally students do please take care of this thing for every opening braces there should be a closing braces right so to check this condition first of all what condition should be true this condition obviously right then this condition must be true means oranges should be available there then only you can check oranges are good or bad right then you can check this condition and then you will buy it right it means to check this condition to go to check the inner if condition the outer if condition must be true here right so this is what the general structure of writing is the syntax of writing nested if if you write a flow chart then how you can draw that flow chart of this if necessary if condition and see it is not always necessary to write to if even one if you can write and just you you can do your task how you can do that task how rather than these two if i can write a single if and that will work same as the two if for working next yesterday for working that we will discuss in with the help of an example with the help of a program first of all uh let me draw a flowchart of this thing then this is programming executing now first of all we check we got first condition condition 1 right now if this condition is true then only true means this condition would be checked again one more condition that is condition 2 right if this condition is true then this block would be executed so if this is true then what should be executed in a if block statement right and suppose if this condition is true and this has been executed so now where the control will go control will not go to the cells right control will not go to the cells because already this condition is true so after that control will go out of this if and else block that is statement x or any statement that as part of that program would be executed and those statements are not part of this this if else blow so i i would say statement x would be executed here and if this condition is false the first condition is false then control will not enter into this if block right control will directly go to this else block right because either this would be executed or this would be executed right now no condition would be checked here now what would be executed outer else block condition right outer o means outer else block b4 block and statements and after this this statement would be executed that is this x would be executed this would be the flow of this one and if suppose we have one one more condition here if condition three then what happened if this condition is true then again we will check one more condition condition three right i think you got the idea of the flow chart and the working of this nested if so let me write down a program now so here i want to check i'm just entering age and salary of the employees in any company or any college and i want to check if age is greater than 50 right then check if salary of those candidates whose a's are greater than 6 greater than 50 if salary is less than 60 k then increment would be 10 000 if salary is greater than 60 k then increment would be 5 000 and if age is less than 50 then increment would be i suppose uh 3000 so now first of all check if age is greater than 50 now for all the candidates for all the you know faculties whose age is greater than 50 you have to check if salary is greater than sorry salary is greater than or less than you can write less than 60 k right then what you want salary would be incremented 10 000 right otherwise if age is greater than 50 but salary is greater than 60 k then salary would be incremented as with 5000 right and now end of this if and if age is less than 50 means age is not greater than 50 then salary would be incremented as after this if i'm not writing here because i guess you cannot see this i am writing this else here for this if else is this one else salary would be incremented with 3 000 rupees right and after this if else i am writing what suppose printf end of program and that's it you can write here get search and you can include clrser and that header file also right so now this is what nesting of if one if within this if i'm writing another if right so suppose this is our output screen when you enter when you run this program this is our output screen and you will be asked enter agent salary and suppose i am entering age is equal to 53 right and salary i am writing about 45 000 so now first of all this would be checked 53 age is greater than 50 yes this is true now control will go to this block salary less than 60 k salary less than 60k yes this condition is also true now salary would be incremented with 10 000 and here you can print salary right means that what would be printed here if you print salary here 55 000 right suppose and this else would not be executed this helps would not be executed right i hope you know the working why i am saying this and now after if what should we would you printed printf end of program suppose i am writing age is 53 but salary is 70k now this condition is true now control will go here salary less than 60 k no it is greater than 60 k so now this if statement would not be executed now control will go to this else for this if this is this else now salary would be incremented by 5000 and you can print salary here now what output you will get 75 000 and after that the cells would not be executed and you will get a root end of program right and suppose i am entering age is equal to 45 and salary is 70 k now this condition would be checked a is greater than 50 no so control will not go here this condition would not be checked in this case directly control will go to this else blow and salary would be incremented by 3000 and suppose you are printing the salary here then output you will get 73 k right and after that end of program now rather than writing this 2 if can we write down these two conditions in a single if yes you can write how you can write using logical end operator here you can write what if a is greater than 50 and salary less than 60 k in that case no need to write down this if because i am checking both the condition in one statement only right and here directly you can write salary would be incremented in this case 10 000 else salary would be incremented 5000 and this else would be same yes you can write down these two if in a single if right and in this one more than one condition we can also check it's not like that we can only check two condition three condition four condition five condition just write down logical end one more condition logical and one more condition logical and one more condition it's up to you how many conditions you want to check right so that is just give you an idea that what is working of nest and nested if and rather than nesting if you can write down logical and operator and you can write down a single f also right so now i hope you got the idea about this thing now assignment for you is you have to take what three numbers and you have to find out maximum among three numbers right and you need to solve that program using nested if you cannot use this logical and operator you have to solve using this nested if so this is you can say a challenge for you so you can write down in comment box that you are going to solve it or not and if you have solved it then you can tell me in comment box and um if you want then you can send me that program or that screenshot of that program on my instagram account right so now that's it about nested if and here also suppose i am not using this end this is a you know video to get you familiar with nested if so i am writing this f here and if you suppose right here semicolon then it will give error right because if you are terminating this if and for if this if you are writing the cells so you will get an error misplaced else or else without a previous f so you cannot terminate this f you cannot terminate here this if because here also you are writing a else right so you need to take care of this thing and you can do your own like you are writing a program and just put a semicolon here and see what output you are getting do and don't write this else and then put a semicolon then check what output you are getting or at this here you can put semicolon and check what output you are getting with this else and suppose if you are not writing this else in that case you are writing semicolon at that time what output you will get right so check out the you know try to do some experiments with these programs and with these things and try to you know make small small programs with these experiments then only you will get familiar with these concepts and you don't have to really memorize these things you will understand these things if you are familiar if you you know do some practice with handson do some practice and some write down some programs on these things and better to write down programs with pen and paper first of all dry run that program and then switch to then jump to your laptop right so now that's it about nested if in the next video i'm going to talk about elsif letter statement so now i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
