recession is not a new thing it comes and goes right we cannot control these things so first thing you keep in mind what you can do what you can control is you can control yourself that's it right so how to control your yourself upskill yourself in this time during this time because everybody's you know almost everybody is just worrying about these news by listening these news negative news negative thoughts and everywhere is these kind of thing negativity and all negative energy right so what you should do you should be positive you should learn something new you should upskill yourself during this time because I guess Rec session is the best time to learn something new to learn to you know to upskill yourself right and we know nowadays competition is so so much high at this level because of AI and all right because of these Technologies so it's comp for you to upskill yourself if you get a job right and what is better time than this recession time if you are not obviously if you are the one you know you're are not getting a job and you are free so rather than worrying about the things right these things lay off and all you just focus focus on yourself and learn something new learn new technologies new tools and all upskill yourself because definitely things will be better after within one year after 6 to 12 month definitely and at that time if you are a skilled person definitely you will get nobody can stop you getting a good job that is for sure right so upskill yourself that is one thing you must do during this time I would recommend right because yeah it's very tough to stay positive during this time right but if you stay positive and if you upskill yourself you focus on yourself right and you keep going then you'll be far ahead of everybody else right so learn these things learn new things new technologies upskill yourself right now but the question is from where there are many free resources many things are available on internet right but if like I personally feel if there is a structured course or structured study material you get or someone to teach you from basic to advance and uh you know someone to solve your doubts and all then what would be better than this thing right so there is a platform Geeks for geeks I hope you have heard about this platform if you are in the St field right so they provide many good courses they organize

than just worrying about these things don't waste your time on these things upskill yourself focus on yourself right now second thing many you know students many uh you know those who are in college second year third year fin year they are having this question in their mind will we get a job during this time so see I have told you earlier also this kind of recession these comes and goes right so definitely within one year after 6 to 12 months things would be better right one thing definitely you will get a job but one thing competition is high you need to take care competition would be very high because of technology is changing rapidly because of these AI kind of things chat GPT cloudy and de right so competition would be very high you have to be you know you have to get updated on these recent technology recent Trends on these tools right so learn how to use these tools what are these tools how to use these new technologies use these things in your project or in your learning or anything right so if you have you know some experience of using these tools so your chances would be very high when things get better better or even right now also it's not like that it's zero hiring no it's only like you can say 20 to 30% less hiring companies are still hiring even in my know one of my relative is having three to four uh offer right now and he has I think joined genek right so companies are still hiring but what you have to be a more skilled person now competition is high right that thing is for sure earlier if you know a little bit it's okay Mass hiring is there and on campus hiring more and more so they they are like let's hire and let's we are going to train him and all right but in this job market in these kind of situation right now this is not the trend right now they want a trained person they don't want to you know expend they don't want to you know spend their money on training people because obviously they why are they they laying off to cut off their expenses they they are not having so much money or cash or fund and all right that is why so they are not going to you know uh spend their money on training people and all so they want a train people skilled people if you are trained if you are skilled already definitely they're going to hire you so they are still hiring just you have to be skilled person and just you have to be at right place at right time that is also important right so yeah if you are a final year student if you're are going to graduate in 2024 right now right now so yeah you have to be a little bit worried about your job right but yeah if you are at right place at right time and if you have skills if you are able to make you stand out from the crowd right definitely you will get a job no worry and if you are in second year third year it's okay a market you know the these kind of things would be better next year so you will get a job but one thing that is for sure upskill yourself that is for sure it's not like that things when things will get better if you know a little bit they are going to hire you no competition would be very high right and one more thing keep your expectations a little bit low especially if you're graduating in 2024 right now don't just expect like after graduating I'm going to get a very good job and hyping job and all no keep your expectation a little bit low even if you are a skilled person you know you know very much right but still you your focus is on getting a you know job where you can learn more and more it's not like that don't focus on your salary especially on your first salary right focus on learning not on salary just get a job in a you know decent good company which is giving you a decent salary that's it and focus on learning that is important right and definitely if you are a valued person means you have increased your value from ha to here definitely they'll pay you more and companies will call you right you don't need to apply anywhere they will call you right based on your maybe online yeah everybody's in our always have those online presence on many portals and on GitHub LinkedIn and all so they will call you if you have a great profile right if you have something within you it's okay just focus on yourself learn and that's it keep yourself updated with new trends and new technologies so I hope this video would be helpful for
