in the series of learning programming in c we have discussed four Loop and Y Loop in C in detail in my previous videos now we are left with one Loop that is doy Loop so that Loop I'll be discussing in this video everything about doy Loop the synx of doy Loop working of doy loop with the help of a flowchart as well as we will see the working of d loop with the help of a program and we'll also see some differences between while loop and d loop right so now let us discuss about do Loop it is almost same as while loop but we will see what is the difference between between while and do while see first of all as you know while loop and for Loop those Loop are entry controlled Loop right and this is what exit controlled Loop now what does this mean exit controlled loop I have already discussed whenever I was discussing in that video introduction to Loops I'll put that video in the side button you can check out there so this is exit controlled Loop while we are exiting from the from the loop at that time condition would be checked right see the syntax of uh this do y Loop then you will get it better first of all you WR write the do this is a keyword after that in curly braces this is what body of the this doy Loop so here we will write that uh statement some statements which uh you want to be executed within this Loop right so this is what statement block right and after closing of the curly braces after that we will write while and here we will write some condition and after this we will put a semicolon this you need to take care in while when you write while condition we don't put semicolon right but here we put semicolon after writing the condition it's not compulsory that you have to write after this curly braces only you can write the while condition in this next line also that is also fine but this you need to take care you have to put semicolon after this otherwise it will give you syntax error right now the initialization would also be done because here we are seeing only the condition but I have told you three factors are there with with any Loop initialization uh condition termination condition third one is increment or decrement or you can say update or modify expression so here we are seeing only condition right so what you can do you can also write something like this before this we do initialization before starting of this doy Loop then do here we write some statements to be executed statement one statement two like this statement n here we write within this body of the loop we write that increment or decrement or you can mod modify your update expression after that we do while we write what while condition and just terminate it you do something like this right or you can do this initialization within this body of the loop also that is also fine you can try it out right I'm just uh telling you first of all the general syntax of writing do Loop right so now as you can see what is the working of this two y Loop first of all the statement block would be executed because we are not going to check any condition without checking the condition control will enter into this block whatever statements you're writing here that would be executed after that condition would be checked if the condition is true again it will enter into this Loop the statement would be executed again condition would be checked right after doing some modify or after you know updating that variable after doing some increment or decrement again condition would be checked and if the condition is false then control will go out of the slope right so if you draw a flowchart how you can do first of all statements should be executed statement block right now after that what uh it will do modify or update or you can say some increment or decrement this would be according to the requirement of the program right suppose if you want to print number from 1 to 100 obviously increment if you want to print number from 100 to 1 then it would be decrement right after that we will check condition if the condition is true there can be two cases true or false again control will go to here again the statement block statement will be executed again update or modify increment or decrement again condition would be checked this would be in Loop if the condition is false that in that case out of this Loop whatever condition you write here after the loop that would be executed right so this is what simple working of this doy loop I hope you you got the working of this doy Loop so let us discuss it with the help of a program now now see after looking at this snx and this flowchart what you can say about doy Loop that the body of the doy Loop will be executed at least once without checking any condition right in any case it would be executed at least once irrespective of the condition if the condition is false then also this would be executed at least once after that because it is what exit control Loop we are not checking the condition while entering into this Loop without any condition we are entering into this Loop right so that would be executed at least once then we check while exiting from the loop we are checking the condition now the condition is false then it will not again enter this Loop in this body of the loop it will exit but at least least one it will execute right now let us see uh with the help of a program why I'm saying this the body of the slop will be executed at least once what output you will get when you write a program see now see here I'm I'm taking a variable I right and here I'm initializing it with zero now see in the body of the loop do control will enter into here because there's no condition here print if Jenny so on the output screen Jenny would be printed once now check check the condition while I greater than 0 means I 0 0 is not greater than Z so condition is false now it will not enter again it will go out of the loop so now it will print out of loop it will not print in the second line if you write here like something like this slash and then it will print into second line right otherwise it will print jny out of loop right see let me write this with the help of Y Loop same program same I'm initializing the side with the zero now in while we are checking condition before before entering into this Loop while I greater than Z is I greater than Z no so it will not execute this body of the loop it will go out of this Loop out of this Loop whatever I have written out of loop so what output we will get here out of loop only here you will get Jenny and out of loop so now we are getting the difference right that is why it is called entry control Loop it is what exit control Loop here the conditions here whatever you will written you will write here within this body of of the loop that would be executed at least once irrespective of the condition whether it's true or false right I hope you are getting my point now second difference is what here we write what semicolon after this while um statement here we are not writing any semicolon here if you write semicolon it will give you error here if you not write semicolon then it will give you error right so when you will use this y doy Loop when you want to execute these statements the body of the loop at least once means when you want to execute the body of the loop without checking the condition at least once then we use in those scenarios in those cases we use dowi Loop but if you want to test the condition first and after that you want the body of the loop would be executed then you will use either for Loop or while loop according to your convenience right so now this is the difference between while and does fine so now see here if I do I ++ now what output you will get here tell me in the comment box do I Loop I'm putting here I ++ I is zero I'm printing Jenny then how many times Jenny would be printed whether it would be infinite Loop or tell me it is finite Loop then tell me how many times the JY would be printed right so this is now your assignment so now that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
