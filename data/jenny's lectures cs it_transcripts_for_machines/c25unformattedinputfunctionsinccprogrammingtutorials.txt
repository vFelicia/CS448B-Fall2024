in the series of learning programming in c in the previous video i have discussed formatted output function means we have already discussed formatted input function and formatted output function input is what scan a function and for formatted output we use printf function so now we are left with unformatted input and output functions so in this video i am going to talk about unformatted input functions in c see what does this mean formatted and unformatted formatted means you can take your output means the output has been arranged arranged in a particular format you can arrange your output in a particular format according to you according to you know your requirement like this suppose i want to take first as in teaser like one then i want to take float value one point two then i want to take any uh string sorry character value and if i want to take any string value yes you can arrange you can take data in this format it's fine using scanner function only you can take suppose if you want to arrange this like this first of all i want to take a float value then a character value then integer value then string value then it it is fine you can take data in this format also right so this is what it's a formatted type of input you can take and how to use these kind of input how to format the input using format specifiers percentage d for integer percentage f for float percentage c for character percentages for string right but in unformatted input functions you cannot format your data you cannot format your input you want to take it just unformatted means basically unformatted input functions these work on character data type and they can uh they can accept a single character only or a string only right right so i'll be discussing about unformatted input functions all the input functions in c and how to use those functions and what output you will get when you uh you know use those functions in your those input functions in your program so now let us discuss about unformatted input functions in c what are unformatted input function in c so these three input function will take input as a character a single character and this will take as a you know the complete string the complete line until that new line operator or you press enter so now first of all let us discuss about get care input function this function reads a single character from the standard input device what is standard input device that is keyboard right let us suppose i am writing a program in main function and this is you know uh the the this is defined in that header file stdio.h main function i am writing suppose a variable character type get ch and in ch i am calling this function getcare in this one there is no argument you need to you no need to pass any argument in this function this is function calling and whatever it will return i am storing that in this variable ch so that when we will print the ch we will will come to know that what input the the get care function is accepted right and after that i am printing this ch percentage c and ch that's it so now let us take this program obviously you have to include that header file also get get get function is what it reads only single character right and whatever it is reading i am storing that character into ch and after that i am printing that character right now anywhere you run this program then suppose this is your output screen and here you will see a cursor that is blinking right now you have to enter something right one character suppose i am entering what j whenever you will press j then that would be displayed on the screen j and cursor would be here right now it is waiting to press other character or you can say enter key whenever you press new line character or you can say that enter key then that value would be displayed that value next line would be executed and that value would be displayed like j the character would be displayed i am i i hope you know how to write printf function we have already discussed in the previous video this is format specifier for character and this is the variable where we are storing that character so j would be printed right but suppose i'm entering the value j k l m n o so you can write down many characters but see it will stop the reading the characters when you will press enter key right you can write down many characters but it will accept only one character or you can say you can you can say it will read only one character so whenever you press enter key then only it will read j and only j value would be stored in ch and j value would be printed these will these characters would not be printed j character would be printed and if you want to print the sky value then here you can use percentage d and then you can print the sky value also of that character right here now this is what get care and now uh let us take this function get cs function suppose rather than get here i am writing here get ch generally you know get set function we use at the end of the program to hold the screen of the program right now when you use this get ch function then what will happen yeah it will it read only only a single character it also reads single character right but that character would not be you know you can say displayed on the screen or e code on the screen what does this echoing mean now whenever you run this program cursor is here and when you will press suppose j then that would not be e code on the screen that j whenever you press the j any key it's not like that you can only uh press you can only enter the characters means the abcd alpha numeric it will uh you know accept zero to nine also some special character also and like uh minus or equal to these kind of things and abcd also and even it is also considering enter as a character so whenever you press suppose i am pressing one right so it will not be e code on the screen directly immediately it will go to the next line and directly it will print that one that is one this one and this function is uh defined where in that header file on your rotate right so for better understanding see suppose i am writing here ch equal to percentage c right so when you will execute this one the cursor would be blinking here right and suppose i am pressing any uh alphanumeric number alpha numeric thing like i'm pressing suppose a so whenever you press a then a would not be equal on the screen directly output you will get ch equal to a this thing only ch equal to a right immediately whenever you press immediately the control will go to the next time immediately the control will execute the next line right and it is used to accept it is used to read the input a single character input from the console from this screen console screen right and see here the character would not be displayed echoed on the screen so suppose if you are commenting this line so you will not get this output if suppose i am pressing a here cursor is there when you whenever you will press a or anything directly you will come to your editor screen no input no data would be displayed here so some somewhere it is used for the security purpose like in case of passwords so that nobody can see whatever input you are giving right and if in place of get che i am i get cs i am writing get ch e function this one now it also accept a single character from the console right and that character would be e code on the screen e means e code right equal method of displayed like this this is suppose my output screen here cursor is blinking whenever you run this program and suppose i am pressing a then a first of all when when you press a that would be displayed here right now cursor is here no cursor would not be here whenever you enter the a that would be e code on the screen and immediately next line would be executed that is here you will get ch equal to a this output you will get right i'm not using slash and if you use slash n then you will get this ch equal to in the next line and this is what in case of gate che and this is what if you press a ah ch equal to it this is in case of get ch here the character has been echoed on the screen whenever you enter that a that would be code first of all on the screen then ch equal to a would be executed but that character would not be equal on the screen if you use gate ch and directly this line would be executed that is cs equal to a that is the only difference between gate cs and gate che right and what is the similarity in both gates and get ch while inputting the value the cursor would immediately jump to the next line without waiting to enter the new line character or without waiting uh to press the enter key right this is the only difference this is the similarity and the difference is what here character would be e code on the screen first of all then the value would be you know displayed c is equal to here character would not be e code on the screen and here in get care this will have we will wait to press the enter key then the value would be displayed the next the cursor would jump jump to the next line right now what about gets get s this is used to take input the complete string as an input suppose i am writing here get s right and sorry what you'll write here is for this one because you are taking complete string like jenny's lectures it's not a single character it's a complete you know string of characters so you can sequence of character that is a string so you have to take character array suppose i am displaying this is what character array i know you don't know the funda fairy but that also we'll discuss in the next videos so the size is 10 and now here i am calling this function get s and i am passing this name get sorry ch fine and now i am displaying for displaying that string you will use percentage s percentage c is for just for single character and now what would be the output the screen is like this right cursor is here and now here you can enter number of characters a string suppose i am entering here jenny's lectures right space you can also give space and now whenever you press enter then what output you will get ch equal to this percentage s this would be replaced by the value in ch the value in cs is what the complete string ch is equal to jenny's lectures so the complete string you can read using this get s right so now i hope you got the idea why we are using gateshead function at the end of the program to hold the screen whenever see like this one this is a program this line will be executed then this line then this line right after that just this line gets it will be executed and the screen would be as it is like this you can check your output you can see your output whenever you press any it's not like that you have to press enter key only whenever you press any alphanumeric thing like abcd or 0 to 9 or anything then it will not display on the screen but it will act as an input for this gate ch right and whenever you press any alphanumeric then it will go back to your editor screen right it will not display on on your that screen monitor screen on the output screen right that is why we use get set function to hold the screen we say that we use getsys function to hold the screen because if this is not here this is not the function then yeah this would be executed but you will not able to see the output it will fluctuate and it will go back to the editor screen but yeah output is there how you can see you can just if you are using turbo see then you can just go to your file and there is a option of dose shell you can click on that and you can see your output right and whenever you when you are type exit on that screen then you will get to know you will you know back to your editor screen right so now i hope you got the idea about these functions but you have to try it at your own it's not like that i have you know completed everything about these functions maybe sometimes rather than care here you can take int ch and here rather than these functions you can write down cs is equal to get care and in printf you can print with percentage d what output you are getting percentage see what output you are getting right so try out different different things in get care if you are using multiple successive character as an input so you can use get care in a loop so if you have any idea about loop i haven't covered loop yet but if you have any idea then you can use this get care function in loop also and you can see what output you are getting right see while taking any input we are taking input here we are not using any format specifier percentage d percentage f percentage c or anything like we were using in scanf that is why we are calling these unformatted input function because we are not using any format specifier here we cannot format our input right because it will accept only one characters and put or a string as an input right but yeah while printing we are using this format specifier it is what for output printf it is not for input that is why i am writing here format specifier but in next video we'll also discuss unformatted output functions in c so i hope that's it for this video now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care you
