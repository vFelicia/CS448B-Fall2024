in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs i have discussed one program in that program i have discussed how to print this pattern right star pattern pattern this is what ah half pyramid in this video we are going to talk about how to print this pyramid inverted half pyramid maybe you are thinking ma'am you are just discussing the simple programs please discuss some complicated programs right please please first of all you have to be very strong at your basic if your basics or fundamentals are strong if you are very good in these programs they then you can easily modify these programs and you can easily grab the advanced concept the the complicated pattern you can easily you know write a program to print complicated pattern if you get these things you know basics that's the biggest mistake students do they switch to the advanced one they think that this is very simple no need to write down this the program for this no need to uh even read this study this right that is the biggest mistake you do if you want to vary you want to be very good in programming please focus on your basics first right write down this program with your hand first of all with pen and paper then jump to your laptop right on these programs if your concept the basics are strong they can easily grab the advanced concepts that is why i am focusing first of all the basic ones i will discuss the complicated pattern also in later videos though so now see in how many ways you can print this pattern we have two ways right i'll discuss both of these first thing please first of all check this one i'll put the link of this in the side button or i'll put the the link of that see playlist on my youtube channel that i have created in the description box of this video you can check out that place but first of all first of all check out this program then you can easily grab this concept now see the inner how many lines are there five lines outer loop we are going to take variable i for inner luffy i am going to take variable j right and i and j two variables i am going to take fine how many lines are there five lines so outer for loop would be i is equal to one i less than equal to five and i plus plus five times i want to print five lines i want to print so that is why one two five this outer for loop is responsible to print the rows or you can see the lines but now how to print these you know stars the actual printing would be done with inner for loop or you can see the inner for loop would be responsible for printing these columns how many columns in first line i have five stars in second i have four then three then two then one right so when i is one the inner for loop j should be repeated how many times five times when i is two j should be repeated 4 times when i is 3 j should be repeated 3 times when i is 2 sorry i is 4 j should be repeated 2 times when i is 5 j should be repeated only one time right so now what you you will do how to write j now j is what see j is decreasing in this case here j was increasing so we'll do j minus minus right but half the day would be initialized with first of all five how many star i want to print five star right so j i'm going to initialize with five and j the condition would be greater than equal to i right and now j minus minus because we cannot fix this one right like five four four because the j value is not changing in every line so it depends on the value of i right so j g greater than equal to y and j minus minus and now we are going to print star right that's it and in in the outer for loop i am going to print slash n because here also new line operators are one then two then three then four and five right so that is why five times only new line operator should be you know uh printed so that is why i am putting this one only in the outer loop that would be done only five times that's it now see the working of this thing i is equal to 1 right 1 less than equal to 5 condition true we are going to enter here j is equal to 5 5 greater than equal to i i value is 1 yes 5 greater than 1 condition true now we are going to enter again here we are going to print star right now we will print star 1 star now j minus minus j becomes 4 again check the condition 4 greater than equal to i i value is 1 4 greater than i yes condition is true again print 1 star j minus minus three condition still true yes again print j two condition still true two is greater than equal to one again print j one condition still tree one greater than equal to one yes condition 2 again print j minus minus now j becomes 0 is 0 greater than equal to i no condition falls now we are going to what we exit from this inner loop the immediate after condition after the center loop is what slash and now slash would be what printed printed means the cursor would go into the new line it is new line operator right now again now here now i plus plus we are out from the inner loop now now i plus plus i becomes now two condition trio yes we are going to enter again now j would be initialized again with five is five greater than equal to two yes condition trim so print start right so i hope you got the working now you can try run this and the star would be printed four times sorry four then three then two two greater than equal to two yes one two three four four times two represented now j minus minus j become one but one is not greater than equal to i so that's it new line operator now in same step would be repeated and this output you will get now when i becomes like 3 then 4 then 5 then i become 6 condition is not true control will out of the loop so this is how this would be printed this is the first way second way is now we are not going to do j minus minus we are going to update this i 1 i loop in j i am printing what same one j should be 1 j greater than equal sorry j less than equal to i and j plus plus we are going to do i minus minus see maybe we can do like this rather than 1 2 3 4 what you can do is 5 4 three two one when i is five they should be repeated five times when i is four j is also four i three j is also three i two j is also two i one j is also one right they should be also repeated uh one time or two time like this right so here i is decreasing not increasing yeah i can also do this thing i minus minus we can do so here decreasing means it should be i minus minus right j i would be initialized not from 1 from 5 right and i should be not less than equal to 5 i should be what greater than equal to 1 when i becomes 0 then we are going to stop so i should be greater than equal to 1 that's it and j would be same j i am going to initialize with 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus now see the working of this one see first of all i is 5 i value is 5. so condition true it is 1 greater than equal to 1 we are going to enter here j is equal to 1 1 less than equal to 5 i is 5 because here i am writing i right 1 is less than equal to 5 yes condition true we are going to enter here star will be printed j plus plus j becomes 2 again 2 is less than equal to i 2 less than equal to 5 condition 2 again we are going to print now j is 3 3 is less than equal to 5 again star google printed js4 condition is still true again it will be printed j is 5 condition is still true again it will be printed j6 now condition is not true 6 is not less than equal to 5 now we are going to enter what we are going to exact from this loop and slash n so cursor would be here now what i minus minus now i becomes 4 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition is 2 we are going to enter again here now j would be initialized again with 1 so i hope you put the concept now right 1 is less than equal to i i value is 4 yes 1 is less than 4 so star will be printed now this time how many times j should be repeated 1 2 3 and 4 times right because i value is four so four star won't be printed here when i if j becomes fives five that would condition is not true and they're going to exit from the loop right like this it would print this pattern so these are two ways you can either modify j loop or you can modify the outer loop also i i hope you got the concept now right so now let me show you the output of this program on my laptop so now let me show you the output on this ide see this was our previous program this this this is the output of this program let me run this again so this would be the output of this program we have half pyramid but now we we are we want to print inverted half pyramid so what you have to change two ways i have discussed all the ways two ways of printing this inverted parameter first is what rather than j plus plus will do j minus minus so j should be started from five and j what greater than equal to i and j minus minus right and then we'll print star that's it and now let me run this and see this is the inverted half parameter right second way is we are not going to do j minus minus we will do what i minus minus so j loop would be same as the previous one j is equal to 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus right but we will do i minus minus so i should be starting from 5 i greater than equal to 1 and i minus minus right now let me run this again see now again we are getting the same output so these are two ways rather than if you want the line should be 5 or 10 or 16 or 15 then what you can do rather than doing this just this this hard coding what you can take how many rows you want you can write down what just take another variable name and ask from the user enter number of rows right at the runtime fine and we will take this at runtime using scan a function right scanf percentage d and address of the name of the variable variable is rows right now rather than writing this 5 because i don't want how many rows i want right user will enter so now we will initialize the psi with rows right i is equal to rows and i greater than equal to 1 i minus minus right and that's same now let me run this see it is asking enter number of rows now let me enter number of rows uh suppose 10 enter c we are getting 10 number of lines or 10 number of rows and this is inverted half parameter right so this is one more thing or if you want to update this with the j then what you can do here what you can write j is equal to 5 j greater than equal to i and z minus minus so that will also give you same output so you can run this again so i hope you got this program right so now i hope you would have to print this pattern right so now that is for this video in the next video i'm going to print a different pattern so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
