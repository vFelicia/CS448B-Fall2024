hi hi hi so today I'm here to discuss the very frequently asked question to me and that is very simple that how to watch my reviews to get blessed of it right see I need starting I have created one playlist only that is data structure and temples and I just randomly picked the topics important topics and available on those topics but after that I realized that I should start is from the beginning and I should complete it right so now I have almost completed the subject a few topics are remaining to go visa left and see kind of created several playlists for each topic if you go to my channel and check out the playlist of my channel then you will find out before every leg on your created of yeast so first of all I guess if you you you are a beginner in data structure and you want to watch my videos you want to prepare for these from the stand alone then you must watch and he's in a destruction to go to that it is a lead in data structure and there I have stuck in the videos some introduction places introduction to is one da that playlist is in order you can check out that after that you can watch list there also you have discussed all the types of linked lists first of all single named appointment circular doubly secular with all their operations after that you can go to stay in data structure the next a list is giving data structure and in queue who I have left with one topic that style if you are working on a telephone email soon after then do you think about which topic please in data structure increase I guess twenty one two to three videos are there I have a cyst from the beginning of the trees that introduction to trees and need of threes and after that all the types of trees finally be sta dnp3 so if a B 3 and B I guess B plus freeze I have a little separate things you can check out that please right and after that red well peas I have uploaded and scaly also I have a weight that was invested many times that my is a loner taking pictures completing of trees when it comes to glass yes I haven't definitely I am sorry for that I have indicated that palest till now but now after that you will find a playlist that the structure and algorithm after that you can go to it presentation DFS DFS minimum spanning trees premise algorithm to find out the shortest distance single source and single estimation like this lifestyle going on for shouldn't better is good right so that's something to watch my playlist ops data structure and algorithm right it means it's not one pas all the way under one I have created separate it is for the dots right so now I hope you voted how much smiley use that is very simple question is but that is frequently asked question second king is in which details videos yeah voice is not here I guess now

please to competitive program means we use on competitive programming okay I think about it also and what what you what was C++ STL okay right here work you work J in back J machine learning I cannot start right now I'm sorry I'm making a machine not good export that I can teach you right could you tell me what what yeah I have you know this is steal from us left on earth sister programming and fightin right now they know to start oh dear thank you so much love you 3000 oh thank you you didn't reply ma'am what what you want to ask I didn't have any question from you or maybe yet maybe I can step in that question right the so see let me know doc this life session was basically to tell you how to watch my videos and I'm getting treatment read those question that for the interpolation of

comment sir sorry hehe million subjects for the gate way importance of data structure you who are asking to me is right Java data structure something like this see it does structure means world it is just way of organizing the data right in a room also if you have messed it mister everything if you are going to find if you find out if you want to search for unified or something like the sending moocher room is completely messed up then you will take much time right for searching any item and you know if you have set your own property then you can easily get anything you know that here is my book here is my cell phone here is this it is so that is the importance of data structure because we are dealing with data and obviously millions and weekends influence of data so it's better to organize the data that's the importance of data structure that is why we have many data structures so no tsunami depends on to achieve inner structures I cannot say that this is good or this is bad it all depends on many factors like what is your priority which type of operations on your Delta let's say on that basis you can choose whether you should use ready is only my list staff huge tweets

the essay you want me to teach like okay I'll think about it but I'm not sure that this thing because for teaching you know it's not like that I know everything and just pick one topic and each sometimes it we when you put three days almost prepared all right if it depends on the how complicated the topic is and when I'm going to explain it then it may take around maybe one arm or something like this when I upload a 30 minute it means I have suited for that video around for one hour one hour and 30 minutes from there I ll w and I just upload a 30 minute video so if I too late for one

playlist that is sorting algorithm standard program so after watching or maybe a list of data structures to high level program and if you want me to upload any specific topic on that if any I am are doing that matrix I've change my education because I how you know what I see many comments and any means delighting like meditation topics not working only right you got back up topic is also very tough it's not like you can say it's very tough but I want to teach you in a simple game each doing that with that you can get that copy one here in one move that is why it's taking me I'm working
