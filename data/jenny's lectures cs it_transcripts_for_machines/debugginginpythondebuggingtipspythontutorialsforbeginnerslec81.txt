hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one project that is we have created a game that was guess the number game right and that was our seventh project in the series that and that was a course for a beginner level right now in this video we will be talking about something about debugging and what are some tips which would be really helpful for you guys to debug your code so now what is debugging just removing errors from your code or you can say removing bugs from your code is known as debugging right you have to find them and you have to remove them that process is known as debugging so I'm sure you have done this process very much because till now you have written many you know programs and so much food but still we'll be discussing some tips just to help you in your debugging process right okay now let's see I I'll do this thing with the help of some exercises so I have a file that is debugging underscore tips Dot py and I'm having a code a little bit code and in that what you have to find out what is the bug so what are some tips that would be really helpful so first first code is this one right so first thing is understand the problem what this code is going to do so we are having a functional display and this for Loop is the range is from 1 to 10 and if I is equal to 10 then it will print by now let's run this and see it is not printing anything right but when we want that when I is 10 then it should print by so that is the problem right so now you have understood the problem that I must reach to 10 and then it will print by and then end of the program so now why it is not printing by C just you can check out this I value this I I is getting its value from this range function right so range is 1 to 10 and we know if you know the this is you can say the working of this range function then you can see its description like it starts by default at a zero and stop is omitted means range 4 is what it will produce 0 1 2 3 this 4 would be omitted so now the range is 1 to 10 means it will print 0 to 9 this 10 would be omitted so never this I would get the value 10. that is why it is not printing anything but if you want to print this by then what you need to do you need to do one to eleven now at this point of time it will print bye right so first just understand what is the problem right and then try to debug that thing another example is this exercise list it's comment out of this thing and let's uncomment the second exercise now here what we want to do we have a dice if you want to if you are you know play Ludo then you know what is a dice and there we are having the numbers one to six so here I am having a list where one two three four five six these text or strings are there in those and whenever you like throw the dice then any random number would be generated between one to six so that's exactly I'm going to do random root Rand int and there I am giving the range one to six any number from one to six would be generated and according to that number I'll print either one two three four five or six right now let's run this see it is printing two let's run this again to right but if I am running this again then it is giving me an error this list index out of range right so maybe you will run one or two time and then you know you will see that it is working fine and that's it but no it is having some bug because when I have gone this fourth time then it is giving me least out of index error right so that is what we can say why it is giving this error and when we don't know when it will give this error so according to this random number generated between one to six it should print this thing right so rather than this if I want to check where is the error the dice number obviously would be between one to six so I first time assign one here and run this so see it is printing two means no error is there if I am assigning two it is printing through here means no error so like this one two three four five and if I assign 6 here and then run this then list out of index again run list out of index list index of range right so I know the problem is when the rent it will generate a random number six then it will give error and why because in the list we know the index would be from 0 to 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 right and you are generating F the shear or random number between one to six so if you know the working of this random function then it will generate between one to six but both are inclusive so when it will generate six then definitely there is no 6 index and it will give error right so what is the solution here we can do one thing from 0 to 5. it will generate number zero one two three four five six numbers and according to that it will print this thing so let's run this C you can run this again and again and now at this point of time it will not give any error right so this is how you can check where is the error right so let's comment out this and this is our third exercise let's uncomment this and see so here I just I'm just asking what is the what is your birth here and if your birth here is greater than if you are between 1980 to 1996 means you are a millennial and if you are greater than 96 then you are a gen Z right okay now let's run this and see if I am entering 1996 it is not printing anything so there is no error but there is a bug you have to find out right so what you can do there is no red line here means no error it is giving so what you can do you can just act as a computer so if I'm entering 1996 so this year is now manually run this means manually try to run this dry run this 996. put this here here is this condition to you greater than 80 1980 yes condition true so this is what true right and here less than 1986 here is 1986 it is not less than we can say less than equal to or equal to equal to but not less than so this condition is not true so we are having true and false but definitely if you are having an and then it will ultimately give you folds means we will not enter in this blue now take this condition LC in this if below here is 96 it is greater than 96 no it is greater than equal to 96 or equal to equal to 96 but not definitely greater than 96 so this condition is also false right now you will not enter here that is why it is not printing anything but at least one condition should be true so what you need to do you can do like if here is less than equal to 96 here or maybe greater than equal to 96 here now at this point of time let's run this if I enter 996 then you are a millennial so you can act as a computer means you are a computer and you are executing the statements one by one dry run the code that is a third tip right and this kind of thing work definitely when you are dealing with these condition type thing right okay the next is I am having this this group okay we are asking the age how old are you and if the age is greater than equal to 18 then you can vote at what are the is you enter right now see here in your code you may be having some red line see there is a red line right so when you go to when you move your cursor to this line then it will show indent expected right so after if there must be some indentation okay now there is no red line maybe you think the code is right okay let's run this how old are you I am like maybe I say I am 23. still it is giving error see it is it is a type error in line number 22. this symbol is not supported between instance of string and Str and end in line number 22. in line number 22 here this symbol is not supported between Str and int means error means definitely you should check the data type means there is a mismatch between the data types you can say so let's try to print this type of the stage this variable let's run this because we have something wrong in type data type because we are getting a type error see the class type is string Str and str23 is Str and we are comparing this with 18 that is integer so that's the problem is that's where we got the problem so just type cast this into int now you found one more bug here okay that's right now let's run this 23. now is it this is Class end but yeah it is running it is not giving any error like you can vote at but what I want that it should print here what age I have entered so it is not giving me this output that I want so there is something now you are not getting any error here so that you can have some hint what is the error right you are not getting any red line here now here comes your experience how much code you have done till now so with the experience you will get number of bugs errors and the solution as well now if you have the idea then you cannot print something like this for that you have to use F string right now it's fine let's run this how old are you 23. you can vote at 23. fine you can just comment out this line right okay the next next is let's comment out this code and let's uncomment this code okay so next is this thing I'm taking two variably and be assigning first zero then user will enter value of a value of p and multiplication a into B and then just printing the multiplication so there is no red line here right so maybe you think it's right let's run this okay you will want you are not getting any error so 3 enter B6 but the output is zero it should print 6 into 3 like 18. now obviously there is a bug so you have to find it out where is the bug so what you can do you can use more print statement like after entering A and B maybe you think after entering a maybe I just want to print like what the value of a a is and after entering B same thing what the value of B and then multiplication A and B and then print multiplication let's run this enter a 4 B5 and 0. so now you got the problem see a is 4 okay Enter B5 but B is 0 B is not taking the value right now you got where is the problem here in this B in this line maybe because whatever you enter B is not taking any value it is still 0. so you just check out this line we got now because of using the print statement where the problem is in this line only right now check this line again and see you are using double equal to here so it should be one single equal to right now let's run this enter a 4 6 and 24. now this time it's fine right so you can use multiple print statement as well to debug your code right or you can just take a break if you are exhausted take a break maybe you can do whatever you want to do your favorite thing then come to the code again or you can ask to a friend right or you can ask on stack Overflow or if you like if my code is running successfully but I have modified something in my code so run that code at that time only so run frequently after modification one modification run that code right if you think that just do this thing also this this and you have done 10 modification in your code and now you are running that code so maybe you are getting multiple error at the same time so it would be not easy for you to debug the code so just after changing a little bit run that so run frequently note that after writing the complete code complete program then only I'll run no now some exercises for you guys is so there is a program to find out like the number is even a rule so I just entered the number if number mode 2 equal to 0 then this is even number otherwise odd number so now you have to find out where the error is you can use the tips whatever we have discussed in the in this video and you can just tell me in comment section one more is so next is this one fizzbuzz job interview question that we have discussed if a number is divisible by 3 then it will print like phase if a number is divisible by 5 then it will print buzz and if number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then it will print Fizz was otherwise it will print just number right so that is we have done the exercise so you can go to that thing what is Facebook's job interview question then come to this now where is the error here if I run this see now what you are getting I am getting 1 2 then 3 is divisible by obviously three then it should print Fizz but it is printing fizzbuzz and then number also three then four then at the place of five it should print buzz but it is printing Fizz buzz buzz fizzbuzz again and fizz so there is something wrong wrong we are not getting what we want right so what is the error here but there are more than one bug in this code so it's okay take your time and try to find out the bugs here and if you are not getting then you can check out the previous video in that case we have discussed this thing the physical job interview question right in the series only we have discussed this thing but I'll put the link of that video in the side button you can check out right I hope now this video would be helpful for you guys just to find out the error and just removing those error from your code right so now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see even more projects now it's in the next video take care
