so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed one Loop for Loop in Python right now we'll be working on one project in this video this is our second project in the series one project we have discussed that was rock paper scissor game right very simple this is also not a tough one but you have to use whatever knowledge you have gained till now in the series you have to use all your knowledge here in this project and the project is you have to create you can take the password generator program right now okay before discussing this thing let me just show you what kind of output should be there for this project right okay so this kind of output I want like first it will show you welcome to the password generator that line or it is not necessary the next line is it will ask how many letters would you like in your password let us suppose I am entering four letters I want then how many symbols would you like uh three how many numbers you like like supposed to and enter see now this is my password in this password I am having like four letters small e capital s small n small n then symbols 3 symbols star this Ampersand and then this round bracket then two numbers I have Nine and Nine randomly it will choose any number maybe same number it can choose here in this case it is choosing the same number nine and nine two numbers it may be seven nine or one two or any numbers right so this kind of password this one is what the hard level password tough one easy level maybe like four letters so at starting it will give four letters then three symbols then three numbers let me just show you that output also okay the simple one is same it will ask how many letters would you like in your password suppose four then how many symbols uh three and numbers suppose two numbers see four numbers sorry four letters so it's starting it will continue give four letters then three symbols then continue three symbols then two numbers and then two numbers these are not it's like you can know these are not shuffled in shuffled way so if hacker knows at which position you have two numbers you know at what position you have symbols at what position you have letters then it would be easy for him to crack the password right so you will be working on both the levels first one the easy one this one and the next level is the hard level your password should be shuffled right so let's try this out now okay now you've got what kind of output we want right for this password generator project right now first one two levels are there easy level and hard level so first try with easy one right so obviously CV you have to generate like random numbers random numbers random symbols like three numbers or four numbers or whatever number a user will enter that much numbers right so one idea is you have to understand first the logic don't just no no go to your laptop and try to you know type the program and all first understand or maybe if it is possible try to make a flowchart so random number you have to generate so obviously we will use some random kind of things so you have to import random module so read about this thing from random what you can use with many functions are there what function is you know suitable for you to this for for to create this project right now you have like list of letters small ABCD Capital ABCD list of numbers from 0 to 9 list of symbols some symbols are there you can take that list or whatever you want I don't know you can take those things you can do some random functions you use of some random functions how you will choose and suppose if you are choosing like obviously four four letters first one letter the second then third and fourth like this so you will use Loop for Loop we have discussed we have discussed range function also that also you can use here and that would be I guess if you are able to put together all these things in correct way then it would be very easy for you guys right so try this out pause the video and try this out first try this that easy level then go to the hard level okay then I'll uh we'll discuss the solution so I hope you have done this project if not it's okay you can go to the solution or maybe take some hint and pause the video and then try the uh try this out let's create a new file and we'll be naming this project too underscore password generator Dot py so obviously we'll be using some random functionalities random functions so better to import random module first right then we'll be having from letters we'll be choosing from capital or small letters 26 Capital 26 more than some numbers then symbols so let's take list of those letters symbols and numbers okay so here here I have letters the list small ABCD Capital ABCD their numbers from 0 to 9 and symbols these are three lists I am having so randomly we will be choosing from these list right so first thing is what it will print like welcome to password generator and then it will ask from the user how many numbers you want how many letters and how many symbols so using input function will be taking input like in input we simply write how many letters you want in your password and that thing always storing in a variable letters we cannot take letters because it is name of this list also so number of letters n underscore letters and whatever you will take sorry using input function that would be a string but I want that should be integer so let's type cast this here only end okay same line we will write for like symbols and for numbers so I'm just copying and pasting this line here and we'll do some changes till now we are fine right now we have to generate letters symbols and numbers from the list right and then first generate suppose I want four letters so four letters and then we can like ah we can take a empty string and add those four letters to that empty string then suppose three symbols so then three symbols then add suppose two numbers then add two numbers to that empty to that string and then just simply print that string that's it that is easy level so let's take a empty string first our name is password and this is what an empty string I am taking right now I want to generate for suppose four letters I am entering at first input 4. four letters one two three four so we have to use a for Loop like four a variable name variable name I'm taking suppose I or a b c d x y z any variable you can take for I in na do we have a function that can that can generate these like numbers like I want four letters so it can generate like four numbers one two three four if seven then seven one two three four five six seven it's something like this yes we have a range function range and we can give the range one two one two this time I want four letters right so if I give like 1 2 rather than obviously four second time maybe I a user enter five letters six letters seven letter so obviously statically I cannot give so here what this variable we will be taking n underscore letters but but the problem is if 1 to 4 if I am giving n letters is equal to 4 so range function will generate 1 2 3. not 4 including four not four but I want four letters one two three four right if you are not aware about this you can just check out the video on Range function we have discussed if the N letters is 5 so it will generate one two three four whatever the end size the stop Point stop Point minus one it will generate so if you want to generate these four letters if we are giving this input 4 then you have to give here n letters plus one so if input I am giving 4 so here one two four plus one one two five then it will generate one two three four yeah exactly I want four letters so it's okay one two three four right now at this point of at running time this rather than this it will be replaced with one two three four so at first one would be assigned to this I one one in this range one two three four yes condition true so now we will generate a random any random letter from the list so if you want to generate any random letter from the list we have a function choice if you remember that random module that video random load choice and in bracket simply pass that list name list name is letters this letters right and whatever letter it will produce it will generate we will fetch we will you know fetch that letter or just store that letter in a variable suppose yeah or any variable we can take this time I am taking here I am taking care right and then after generating that character just add that character to this password this empty string so just add this thing here password is equal to or you can say concatenate and simply we have discussed in the very first videos of my python series using plus we can concatenate in strings so password Plus care that's it right so if you simply want to print at this point of time what would be the password after generating after just completing one Loop only the numbers only just we are going to just check out like till now we are working fine or not or is there any problem or is there any error let's run this welcome to password generator how many letters you want suppose four it will ask how many symbols three how many numbers two see it will generate only one for Loop we have discussed till now we have written in our program left four letters so four letters are there small o capital M Small U capital Z and it will just print these four letters that's it now you have to generate three symbols two numbers and add in the string in just print I hope now this is easy for you at this point of time if you have got whatever if you have got that one for Loop right so if you have got this for Loop then easily you can write down those two remaining for Loops right and rather than this this line we can use that shorthand also the password plus equal to cat that is also fine right or rather than these two lines we can simply use we can simply write password plus equal to random road Choice letters ins one line also we can write down this thing but better to write down you know for better understanding for beginner for beginners it would be better to write down these two lines right okay rather than printing the password Here now one more for Loop for I in range one more for Loop for second thing is for symbols so range would be one two and underscore symbols plus one y plus one I hope you got this and then here same we will generate a character sorry any random symbol so we have a variable random sorry it's r a n d u n random Dot choice and simply pass symbols from this list we have to choose right and then simply we have a password we can simply add that character those characters one by one right so here for symbols also one Loop is for number so simply I am going to copy paste this Loop only for I in range third is for numbers so it should be n numbers plus 1 then rather than the list name is here should be numbers and then we will be adding the this one by one this character to the password and finally we will print now print password okay let's run this and see letters how many letters four three two C at starting we have four letters then we have three symbols symbols may be same two symbols are same like the opening but Embraces opening round bracket like and two numbers eight two but these are not shuffled these are in a particular order so this is not a tough one to crack this password is easy now if you haven't done this before at this point of time you got the idea right now pause the video and try the hard level without checking the solution right okay now I hope you have done this what we can do see if you have you remember that function Shuffle we have discussed a shuffle is a function in a random module choice is to choose any particular any random thing from any random item from the list and Shuffle is to shuffle the list so suppose rather than this string because at first here we are taking password as a string rather than the string if we have a list password list here we have our list then we can easily Shuffle that list using Shuffle and then we can simply print good idea so rather than taking here string let's take list let's take another thing password list and other than string we are taking sorry we are taking empty list here right now maybe you are thinking in using plus we can concatenate in string same method applies to a list also you can just generate any random character and you can using plus only you can simply concatenate to that list also so no need to change here plus that is fine three Loops would be same right so okay rather than here print password at this point of time we are printing password list okay let me just show you the difference okay four three two password is not defined okay sorry we are using here password but the name is password list at this this time we have updated we have changed the name it's password list here also password list and here also we have password list right okay I hope it works four three two see now we'll be having four letters three symbols two numbers but in a form of list okay now next next thing is Shuffle this list okay simply we have using for Loop also we can Shuffle this to methods but directly we are using we have a inbuilt function so use that one Shuffle and password list okay and now again print password list okay let's run the send C C this is first and this list is after shuffling see here it's out like that first four we are having letters first we are having this letter Q then we are having a symbol then again a letter then a number then letter like this so we have shuffled this list so this is I guess more secure password right now it's a list obviously but we need password in the form of a string just right so how to convert this thing into a string okay fine we will simply take a empty string very easy right will take a for Loop will be taking a for Loop four high or any variable name you can take for I in password list in that list shuffled password list so now password list is and then from the shuffled password list the first first item would be assigned to this I so that item in password list that would be obviously true so we will fetch that first item and then add that item to this empty string yes okay so how to add this password plus equal to or rather than I if we take care then that would be more meaningful password plus equal to cat that's it and after that just print this string password right okay let me show you let's run this four three two see first without shuffling then the list after shuffling then we have this password so rather than printing this list and this list you can simply print this this thing so I guess this password is a tough one to crack right see without shuffling in our output this was the list after shuffling this was the list right and then we have taken an empty string then for care in password list now at this point of time this is password list so first first of all the first item would be taken eight now eight would be assigned to this scare this 8 in password list yes condition true so control will enter here and password plus equal to can now password is equal password is now empty so an empty string we'll be adding the character in character we have eight so first of all eight would be added then next is three then three would be added then this address of that would be earlier than U then dollar till the end of the list all the character one by one would be added to this password and we simply print that password to the string now I hope you got the working of this thing both the level both the level you got easy one and hard one if not it's okay pause the video take the notes with you know on your paper dry on this thing and then definitely will get it right so I hope you go teach and every line of the program we have written to generate this thing for a password generator project right if not please don't skip the video and don't just jump like you have you have you know watched my video and you got this no maybe you can just copy paste the complete code on your you know with you know a pen and on your paper and just dry on that thing try to understand each and every line why we have written that line in the program what is the meaning of that line try to understand the logic you know don't just go with my words or my program dryer and at your own right so I think you got this this project you have done this project now we are done with we are done with two project in the series so now we'll see you next video till then bye take care
