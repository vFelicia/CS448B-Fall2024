so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen round function right now in this video we'll talk about F strings basically you know in Python 3.6 version there was a mechanism introduced for string formatting new method for string formatting right that is F strings right because these strings are prefixed with f alphabet F that is why these are known as F strings right now why this method was introduced what are F strings drawbacks and and there are other you know methods also to format strings like Str or format function we can use or we can use that percentage sign right so why they have introduced this thing right so that we will see first of all with the help of one example program practically I will show you then you will get it better okay so let's create a new file for this we'll see F strings right F underscore strings dot p y right let's take one example I am taking just a name suppose name is Krishna and let's say I'm taking age is suppose I am taking 30. and we can say one more thing height we can say suppose height in float will take so in meter we are taking so that is why I am taking suppose one point six meter right so one this type is string this type is int this type is float right in one line I want to print like my name is Krishna I am 30 years old and my height is 1.6 meter like this so you have we will concatenate this thing one thing we have discussed how to concatenate ah strings till now one method only using plus sign so what we can do like we can write print and here we can write my name is and using plus sign we can concatenate like name right after that comma and I am we can concatenate this because I want the value to be fetched from this variable age so age I am age years old only this thing we are printing right so now let's run this and I'll show you the output see it will give you one array type error can only concatenate string note integer to Str because my name is this is Str name also strokim we are putting this in double quotes this is string years old this is string but age is what diesel so using plus we cannot concatenate string with integer right so for this we have to convert this like Typecast Str and age now let's run this see now my name is Krishna and I am 30 years old so we have to type cast this thing but like this we have multiple variables 10 15 variables and there we have some values and I want to print this kind of thing so we have to take care of this thing like we have to type cast those into string that would be a tedious task another way is like this also we can write down rather than plus we can just simply put a comma here and age right rather than plus we can just put comma here and just write down the name of the variable name that is also fine this time also it will print my name is Krishna and I am 30 years old you don't have to type cast so this is a plus point but here the point is here also if we have multiple variables like 10 to 15 variables and we have to write on this thing so you have to take care what you will put in this like double quotes then comma then name of the variable not in double quotes then again comma then the string whatever you want to print exact on the output screen you have to put that in double quotes or single quotes in Python single quote is also fine but the variable name you have you cannot put in that double quote or single code like this you have to put comma then that variable name then ear sold now I will print something like this again my height is so like this my height is then we have to print like height 1.6 and then for meters what we will do again in double quotes or single quotes meters like this right so this would be very tedious thing and maybe we can miss this this thing right here let me just first run this and show you like my name is Krishna I am 30 year old and my height is 1.6 meters right but the problem here is if you miss one comma here suppose I forgot to write down this comma it will give error right you have to put comma here what if I can put everything in one single coat I'll start one single quote here my name is the name I am this year roller my height is this and simply we just uh no uh and the double quotes right within the line no command nothing how we can do that thing obviously that would be easy to read and all so that is why they introduce one more you know two more methods are there using Str dot format function that is also very you know something tedious to do and error prone and one more method is we can use percentage also but that is also the chances of Errors would be more but one method that was introduced in Python 3.6 is very simple that is using F string we can format in simple one line only we can write now how you can write down this thing see just have to prefix the string or whatever line you want to print with f so print and Within These brackets we will write down first f it means that now this is F string right now you don't have to put this comma command all simply you will put my name is and obviously from name variable I'll take the value so the variable then the name of the variable just put that thing in these curly braces that that's it right now see in one closing and this opening bracket we have simply write down one thing so this is what F string now so that would be prefixed with f as you can see F and in braces what you will write the values you want to evaluate right or we can say in braces we will write the Expressions that would be replaced with their values now I want to replace this name with Krishna so just put that in braces I want to replace the edge with 30 so just put this in curly braces just put height in curly braces that's it so I guess this line is easy to read and less error prone than the previous line I hope you agree with me right now let's run this and I'll show you the output see my name is Krishna I'm 30 years old and my height is 1.6 meter so this F string this string formatting mechanism or the method is easy less error prone more concise way to format strings and a faster way to format strings in Python and it was it is available since python 3.6 and see these these whatever you will write in these curly braces these expressions are evaluated at runtime so rather than a simple variable you can write down some expression also let me just show you one more thing all right if I write so here let's see uh in this calibration I have done a is into 2 this is some expression or you have to evaluate this thing so at run time it would be evaluated and it would print what C krishna's father age is okay it is directly printing age into two y so because we haven't used prefix F in this case right so that is the mistake we have done so let's put F Here and Now run this see krishna's father ages 60 years old 13 to 2 is 60. so rather than one variable you can put some expression also right two into five three into five or some other long expression row so that would be evaluated at runtime and it will give you the result so I guess it is a simple and convenient way to format some strings and less error prone method right so I hope you got now how to use this F strings in your program right about string formatting we will see in detail in later videos right my motto is just to get you familiar with f strings one stream formatting method because in later programs we will see more and more these F strings right because these are simple to use and less error so I hope you go to what are F strings in the next video we'll see you on coding exercise you know how to use f strings in your program so now it's with the next video till then bye take care
