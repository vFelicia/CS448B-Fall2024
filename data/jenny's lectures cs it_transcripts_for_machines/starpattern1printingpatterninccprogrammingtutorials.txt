in the series of learning programming in c we have discussed all the loops four while dual as well as we have discussed nested loops nested four nested while listed do i do right so now from this video i'm going to start discussing some programs printing pattern programs 5410 printing pattern programs we are going to discuss right but first in this video we will discuss how to print this pattern right but first please check out that video where i have discussed what is need of nested loops right in that video i have discussed how to print a pattern like like this this pattern this kind of pattern i have discussed in that video right this video would be very basic and this video will be really very helpful to get all the programs that are we are going to discuss all the printing pattern programs here this is the basic video so please i recommend you to check this video first i'll put the link of that video in this i button you can check out in this video you will get the idea why we are using two for loops every single line the meaning of every single line i have discussed with proper example so that would really this video would be really helpful for you please check out that video first and then come to this video then you will get this video very easily right so now see here i am printing five lines and in each line i am printing five stars but the pattern is this one lines i am printing five but in first line i am printing one star then two star and three then four then five and this could be like this you can print ten lines right and in this line six star then seven start eight 9 and 10 these kind of no pattern you can print it this is what a triangle see now i'm going to discuss this one only the logic on this board will drive in that program after i am not writing the complete program here but after that after discussing the logic i'll show you the output on that vs code on that that ide right on my laptop so please i have in the previous video i have already told you please install vs code as well as that compiler mingw and extension like code runner for your compiling the program and running the program right so i hope you are done with it if you are not done and if you are facing any problem you can tell me i'll make a video i'll upload a video on that thing also like how to install vs code or compiler and everything right so now get your laptop ready now see i'm just going to discuss the logic here so now here two for loop you need nested for loop why why the reason you will get when you watch this video one for loop is to print these lines how many lines five lines right so outer for loop would be you will take a variable i or j you can take any variable right and in a for loop you are actually printing so in first line i am printing 1 star in second line 2 star right so when i is equal to 1 means this line i is equal to 2 means you are printing this line i is equal to 3 this i is equal to 4 and i is equal to 5 but if i is equal to 1 then the inner loop would be j right here i am printing j should run how many times only single time because only one time i am printing star here when i is equal to 1 then j was running how many times 5 times when i is equal to two at that time also j was running five times right please check out this video first after that come to this video now when i is equal to two then j is running how many times two times one and two two times i am printing right so how to print actually just write down a for loop j is equal to one right and j less than equal to now here j is not x here j was fixed 5 so i have written j less than equal to 5 because every line i am printing star 5 times but here j is what changing first 1 time then 2 then 3 stars and four stars and five star so now what you can write here see i one j is running one time i is equal to two in second line j is running two times when i is three j is running 3 times 1 2 3 here 4 times here 5 times so i hope you are getting my point j should be less than equal to i type and j plus plus and within this you are just printing star this is inner loop right and we are repeating this again and again so we will put these statements in outer loop that is 4 i is equal to 1 and i less than equal to now i is what number of lines outer for loop is what to print number of lines how many lines 5 lines so i less than equal to 5 right and i plus plus and as well as in the after this inner loop in the outer loop what you have to print because after printing one star next two stars should be printed in next line next three star should be printed in next line right so after the inner loop completion after running the inner loop two times then new line then again new line after each line a new line so new line how many times you need new line operator one two three four and five or obviously you can say four right so now 5 5 times so now new line operator we will print we will write down in outer loop not an inner loop right so now that's it this is the logic you can see when we dry run this program i i is equal to 1 i less than equal to 5 yes condition is true so now control will enter here now j is equal to one so now j is also one at first j less than equal to i i value is one j one j is also one one less than equal to one yes condition true so control will enter here so now we are just printing what star first right now j plus plus j becomes 2 2 less than equal to i i is 1 is condition true no so control will go out of the loop immediately what statement we have written after after this loop printf slash n so now cursor would move to next line right now i plus plus because now we are in outer loop i plus plus now i becomes 2 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition true again enter into this loop now what again j is equal to 1 so j would be initialized again to 1 now 1 less than equal to i is 2 yes condition is true control will enter here again we are going to print here star j plus plus now j becomes 2 2 less than equal to 2 because i is 2 here yes condition is true again we are going to print 1 star now j plus plus j becomes 3 is 3 less than equal to 2 no now control will go out of the loop and slash and slashing means now cursor would be next fly now i plus plus now i becomes 3 3 less than equal to 5 yes condition true again enter here right again j would be initialized with 1 so now again check the condition and this should be repeated right now in this line three star will be printed next next four star will be printed next five stars should be printed when i becomes five finally when i becomes six i plus plus means i become six now six less than equal to five condition is not true so now control will go out of this four loop right and now this pattern should be printed in the previous program here what we were writing here rj less than equal to 5 that's it this is the only change in this program so if you got this program right by watching the previous video then you can easily modify according to the pattern right so now let me show you i hope you you got it now let me show you this program on that terminal see so now let me show you the same program on this ide now let me create one more file pattern 2 dot c i have already created pattern 1 right so now see i hope you can include the header file and you can write down small void mean so now we are going to take two variable i and j right and two for loops outer for loop would be to print line so i is equal to one semicolon i less than equal to how many lines i want to print according to the pad according to the pattern uh five lines right and now i plus plus and within this we are going to write one another for loop that is for j so j is also starting from 1 and j less than equal to i right and j plus plus fine and now within this inner for loop what you are doing you are printing star right and one more thing in this inner forum we are printing star and in outer for loop you are printing what new line right why new line we i already told you so now that's it let me run this and see what output you are getting see you are getting this this kind of output and this is what exactly what we want right this kind of ah pattern now if you want to print what 10 lines simply you have to write down here i less than equal to 10 and that's it right 15 lines you can easily write down here 15 right whatever you want to print or if you are not you do don't want to do hard coding then you can just take a simple variable like n and at the runtime you can ask the from the user enter value of n and here you can write down i less than equal to n right so now that is also fine and this is what hard coding fine so i hope you got it now how to print these lines see for in the previous video i have told you what we are printing printing we are printing the star in a square pattern right like this this is the program this is the program pattern one let me run this program for you and what output you are getting this kind of output you are getting right in every line i am printing five star and i have five lines so that is why outer loop is less than equal to five and inner loop is also less than equal to five but in this case in first we are printing only one star in second line we are printing two star then three star then four star that is why we are printing here less than equal to i writing a less than equal to y so i hope you are getting my point now so now i hope you good how to print this pattern see please let me know in comment box if this processor of explaining the program is fine like first of all discuss it the logic on the whiteboard and then i'll show you the output on the screen on that laptop right or if you want me to change something you can suggest me in comment box so now i hope you you got this program now it's in the next video in that video we'll discuss some other pattern right so now tell them why take it
