in the series of learning programming in c in the previous video I have discussed while loop Basics about while loop the general syntax of while loop the working of while loop with the help of flowchart as well as we have seen a program the basics right now we can do many things with while loop it's not like that whatever sentex we have written in the previous video that is the only way to write while loop no in many ways you can write while loop and see this whatever I I'm going to discuss in this video that would be really helpful for you if you want to explore if you want to you know learn in deep about these looping statements about while loop right because from this part whatever I'm going to discuss in this video generally there ask questions in placements in interview and any competitive exam right the those kind of questions in sorry the program would be given a code would be given small code four or five lines and you are asked to tell output of that code so in that thing in that in those questions they'll not write down the you know simple while loop this is a general syntax and just write down while loop and ask you what is the output of this program no they will do some other kind of you know you can say those questions would be tricky they will write why Loop in different different ways and you think that this is not syntax of Y Loop so this must be an error but no that will not give you error that will definitely give you some output maybe not that output uh you want but maybe some abnormal behavior that will show but it will not give you error so those things I will discuss in this video right so now is discuss in how many ways we can write while loop see first of all what was General syntax of while loop we write while this is a keyword here we write some condition termination condition here this is what here I'm going to write some statements or you can say this is body of loop right and here only we write what that modify or update expression you can say that increment or decrement and after that that's it the initialization is before the condition right all the three things which is important for any Loop is in ization condition termination condition and modify and update expression or increment or decrement in for Loop we write all the three things at one place but in y Loop we write different different places here initialization then condition then within the SL body of the loop we write that increment or decrement right this is General syntax of Wu now see if you write something like this I starting from one I less then 10 print F I'm going to print I and then i++ then what output you will get here one from one it is going to start 1 2 3 up to 9 it will print it will not print 10 because condition is I less than 10 not I less than equal to 10 so 1 129 it is going to print right this is what according to the syntax I'm going everything fine here according to the syntax but suppose if I write something like this now condition is I'm putting I equal to equal to 1 so first see I would be initialized as one in the memory that this is I condition is I equal to equal to 1 this is equality condition I'm going to check is I equal to 1 yes condition is true then control will enter here and I value will be printed on output screen you will get one now plus plus I you can write I ++ or Plus+ I here in this case both are same means I becomes now two again going to check the condition right I equal to equal to 1 is 2 equal to 1 no condition is false directly control will go out of the loop and what would be printed now end of program that would be on your screen one and end of program right now this is what equality condition but some somewhere it is also written something like this I equal to 1 now what output you will get C at starting I is 1 here I equal to 1 this is what assignment operator you are using this is not any condition assignment operator means the value of the right hand side whatever the value that would be assigned to the variable that is on left hand side now one would be assigned to I right now I becomes one again it is one but again it is assigning the value so it is one now here we have one one means true always if here other than zero you write anything 1 2 3 uh 11 12 anything then that would be considered as true if you write zero then only it will be false so now one means true it will print I that is one would be printed now I plus plus I means I becomes two now again check the condition condition is what I equal to 1 again assignment operator so in I I'm going to assign again the value one so I value becomes again one right condition is true again it will print one I ++ means 2 again check the condition but it is I is equal to 1 again it will become what 1 right so now again it will print one so now what do you think is it going to end no it would be infinite Loop because condition will always be true so it will print infinite time 1111 on your screen right so please take care of this thing double equal to and single equal to if you want to check the equality condition double equal to you have to write here right and if you write here something like this see same if I write here something like this while one you are doing you are you are doing what hard coding the while one you are writing in your program only this condition will always be true right if you write here like 10 or one suppose 10 is here so while one condition is true 10 would be printed on your screen plus plus I it becomes 11 right now while one condition is true now 11 would be printed on your screen I ++ 12 while one condition is true you are not giving any termination condition it is not going to end so it will print what 10 11 12 like this it will print so it would be an infinite Loop and see what it will print it's not like that it it will it is going to print till Infinity yeah it will print within a range within which range the range of the integer range of integer is what 3 276 8 2 3 276 7 so once it will reach till 32767 it is not going to print 32768 32769 then what it will print see this is what circle of s so once becomes 32767 it will print What minus values 3 2768 3 2767 like this 1 then again zero then again this this would be an infinite Loop but values would be printed within this integer range only right you can see the output now uh after running this program but but single difference is what I'm putting here I not one I'm just putting I here now you think that you are not giving any condition here so so it would be an infinite Loop but not it would not be an infinite Loop so now where it is going to end see here I is 10 suppose I is 10 at starting while I I means 10 anything other than zero considered as true 10 is true so 10 would be printed I plus plus I means it becomes 11 now again 11 that is also true 11 would be printed 12 again 12 is also true 12 would be printed 13 and this is going to uh no it is going to like this 10 11 12 13 14 but what where it is going to end once the value would be reached till 3276 7 like it is going to print if you want to print vertical then you have to use slash and here otherwise it will print horizontal so now after that some time it will print at one time it will print 3 276 7 after that I ++ means it will become 3 2768 so 3 2 7 6 8 it would be printed again 3 2 7 6 7 until like this 3 2 1 now at one time value of I becomes minus one plus plus I now it becomes zero so now here the value of I is zero now check while I is z zero means condition is false now it is going to stop means now it will print what end of program till minus one it is going to print right so it is not infinite Loop please take care of this thing still you are not giving any condition here you are not giving any condition but still it is not infinite Loop it is already a condition because at one time definitely I value would become zero and once I value becomes zero it is going to end I hope you are getting these Concepts right next thing what you can do with this is suppose I'm not writing here this plus plus I I'm not writing any modify uh expression here so now what what will happen I is 10 so now first what value would be printed here I'm writing I only so 10 would be printed 10 10 is true 10 would be printed no plus plus or minus minus I right again control will go here I is what again 10 10 is true again 10 would be printed I is what again 10 10 would be printed so now it would be an infinite Loop here also I'm using I only difference is what I'm not incrementing that I if you will not incre that I then definitely I value would be remain same that is 10 10 is always true so now it would be an infinite Loop and it it is going to P 10 10 10 10 infinite number of times right next is what suppose I'm writing here this condition I less than equal to 10 and I'm not initializing this I here I'm I'm doing I ++ here right condition I'm writing modify expression I'm writing I'm not initializing this value of I so now I don't know what is value of I right so now what it will print I less than equal to 10 we don't have any I value starting value so it is not going to print anything it will just print end of program now in this case I have some doubt so you run this program and tell me in comment box what output you are getting here if you're writing something like this no initialization I less than equal to 10 condition is given and modify expression is also given right so now here just only you will get end of program right next thing what you can do here suppose you don't you don't write any condition here I is equal to 1 but no condition here but here it will give you error it is not a valid syntax right it it it will give you compile time error right next is what you can do suppose here only I'm writing I ++ and I'm removing this I ++ from here and I is uh I'm writing I zero right now what output put you will get here see at first time I is zero right now you will think I ++ means I becomes one and one is true so it will print one no it is what post increment post increment means what is the funa first the original value of the of that variable would be used in the expression after that value would be modified original value of I is zero zero would be used here for the condition now zero is what false so it is not going to enter into this Loop it is directly exit from the loop and what it will print end of program just end of program right in case I'm writing here uh this this uh plus plus I now now it is what preincrement preincrement means first the value of that variable would be incremented after that the incremented or the updated value would be used either it's incremented or decremented whether you are using here plus plus I or minus I right now I'm using here plus plus I so now value becomes one for first now one would be used for this expression now one is what true so it is going to print one now again here I'm not writing anything so again it will check the condition right plus plus I means it becomes two now two is also true two would be printed again plus plus I means three three is also true three would be printed right now tell me is it infinite Loop or not no because this is I integer variable we have some range of integer in that range we will somewhere sometime at one time we will also definitely going to reach to zero because I'm incrementing I so 1 2 3 up to which will print this then minus values then till 3 2 one after that plus plus I means it becomes zero it is going to stop till minus one it is going to print so you can see the output after running this program right now next is what um you can also use while loop with care data types if you use character data type here then what output you will get see and see tell me one thing this is your assignment if I write semicolon after this while loop in that case what output you are getting you have to tell me in comment box right now I'm doing this with character I'm using while loop with character I hope you know the range of the character that is fromus 1 to8 to 1 to7 right this is the program right now character value that is a first of all the variable name is this one and a is stored not exactly a is stored here the SK Sky value of a is 97 that would be converted into binary form and that would be stored in memory right but here just for the understanding purpose I'm writing a here while ch ch is a a is 97 that is true CH would be printed here so means percentage D CH so 97 would be printed here SK value of a is 97 right right uh next is CS ++ means value becomes 98 so now here you can say 98 would be stored 98 98 or you can say B that is also true so now percentage D we are using so 98 would be printed then 99 something like this but it is not infinite Loop right why so because range of integer is what sorry range of character is what 1 127 then after that 1 128 127 126 something like this right this is signed character right I'm not using any uh know signed or unsigned keyword here so that is consider considered as signed character so now value becomes now at one time value becomes 127 okay 127 will be printed after that plus plus means it is not going to be 128 it is going to be what 128 127 126 and minus1 till 1 right now after that CS ++ 1 after that value becomes zero so now here zero zero means false and now control is going to exit from the loop and that this is output this is the output you are getting it is not infinite Loop here right but suppose here if you are writing percentage C then tell me what output you will get this is your second assignment you can consider it as an assignment right percentage C and tell me what output you are getting in this case right again if you are doing something like this and it is not always that you have to do plus plus here you can also write minus minus here same case suppose you are storing a here a means 97 97 is true 97 would be printed suppose I'm using here percentage D 97 is printing here CH minus minus 97 now it becomes 96 not 98 96 is also true 96 would be printed here now it becomes 95 95 would be printed here something like this right and and now at one time till one till one it is going to print right now 1 is 0o so now it will print till 1 97 to 1 in reverse order that's it and here we have an error after get H you have to use semicolon right you have to take care of these things and here also you can write down some some constant positive or negative like 11 I'm writing 11 I'm writing or simply Z or 1 I'm writing or here you can use any condition like relational operator and as well as you can use that logical operator also two conditions you can use right so here I'm writing logical end CH less than 12 127 and I equal to equal to z i is one more variable I'm taking there their iner I right so if both the conditions are true then only it will consider it as a true if I'm writing here I is equal to equal to 1 but I is zero here so this condition will always be false so if this is false then ultimately it is is false and it is not going to enter into this while loop body not even uh one time right because condition is at first time only I the condition is false so it is going to exit from this Loop so here you can use two or more conditions using some connector logical connectors also right relational operator you can use or any variable you can write here simple variable or any constant value you can write here right and you can also do what nesting of while loop one while loop within this we can use another while loop another while loop that that is nesting right or you can use any if else statement within this while loop like here I'm writing some condition while within this while I'm writing some if or else conditions based on the output you want based of based on your requirement right that that thing we can also discuss when we'll discuss some programs when we'll write some programs using while loop or for for Loop right so now this is what I guess that that's it but you can also do some experiments I I cannot tell you everything here this is what I can just give you an give you an overview these kind of things you can also do so try out different different things with while loop and see what output you are getting right and if in any questions you are getting any problem then you can ask me in comment box or you can uh ask me on your my Instagram account you can message me there right so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
