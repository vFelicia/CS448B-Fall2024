hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen operator overloading right this video we'll see method overloading and method overriding because we have I have told you to implement polymorphism we have some ways like four ways first is done IP and python operate overloading method overloading and Method overriding so duct typing and operator overloading we have discussed now the two are remaining method overloading and Method overriding these things we'll discuss in this video right because it's very clear I mean it's very important to clear the difference between method overloading and method overriding that we will see with the help of example and practically I will show you but before that I want to tell you something it is important especially for those who are preparing for gate 2024 exam an academy is conducting a gate ready combat one 24th of September at 11 am and the duration

can go and check out now let's see what our method overloading and Method overwriting I hope operator overloading is clear to you guys now first we will see method overloading now let me just first clear one point python doesn't support method overloading okay but yeah we can achieve this type of feature this type of method overloading feature with some other ways in Python how that all helps you I'll show you but by default python doesn't support method overloading first let me just show you what is method overloading method overloading means we are defining multiple or many methods with same name but different argument in a same class okay because obviously we are discussing this thing under polymorphism and this is one of the pillar of oop objectoriented programming and there everything we do or every program we write with type of classes and objects right that is why in the context of that I am going to tell you this thing right so method loading means defining many methods with same name but different parameters or different number of arguments within a same class what does that mean let me show you first let's just create a new file in this project polymorphism demo method overloading and overriding Dot py okay first let's take a class and I am taking simple class name like maybe demo any classroom you can take and in this class I am defining a function the simplest example I am taking add function right and I want to add like two numbers so what I will do just return a plus b that's it right and see if I class object of this demo object of this demo class if I create then how to call this method V Dot add and what you need to pass two parameter like maybe two and three I'm going to pass okay so obviously it is returning something so you have to print whatever it will return the value of addition you have to print let's run this and it will show you five okay now overloading means we have within the same class we have many methods with same name so let's create one more method with same name add but different number of parameter you know and the first we are having two parameter now I am passing three parameter suppose a comma B comma C these three numbers ABC so maybe you think we can just call this method also d dot uh sorry uh D dot add but this time I want to call this method so three parameter I will pass so one comma two comma three and yeah it is returning so you have to print the value now maybe you think this will return five and this will return six okay let's run this C now this time you are getting an error type error in this line line number seven where you are calling this thing missing one required positional argument C demo dot add missing one required positional argument C but using this set I assume that it will call this ad because there are two argument and using this calling this add method this calling it will call this if it happens then this is method overloading because same method but different parameter and we are able to call but here in Python we are not able to call this add method because python I have told you doesn't support method overloading okay you can Define multiple method with same name and different parameter but out of all the definitions it will consider the latest definition of that function so it will discard this definition the python interpreter and it will just consider this definition of head now for a python interpreter the definition of ad is this so here you have to pass three parameter to call this one that is why this line you are getting an error okay so this is the thing python doesn't support method method overloading but this feature or this kind of functionality this method overloading we can achieve with some different method one way is using default argument let's have let's define only one method a b and let's have one default argument C that is by default zero and it will return a B plus c bye now see these two lines are as it is but you will not get any error this time see you will get 5 and 6. because we have used default argument if you are not passing third argument then by default it will take c as 0 if you are passing the value of C then it will take back the value of C whatever you will pass so this is same kind of functionality we are implementing that method overloading feature we are implementing with the help of default argument right because we are calling this add and add like there are two methods like there are two uh you know definition of this ad one is accepting two argument one is accepting three but actually there is only one second way is using ads we can create this we can achieve again you can say we can Implement method overloading in Python foreign total and for I in us because we don't know how many arguments we are going to pass while we are calling this function right so total is equal to total Plus sorry I right and at last we will simply either return sorry in the spelling mistake total like we can return this variable total right so this is also fine so this time let's suppose we are calling this add with six argument as well so three times we are calling this ad every time the number of arguments are different okay but method is only add so let's run this see 5 6 and 94 it is working fine because using our apps it means so this is also like same kind of functionality or you can see same kind of feature of method overloading so this is how you can achieve method overloading impact I hope you got what is Method overloading and how you can achieve in Python because python doesn't support this thing at last I'll tell you the difference proper difference between overloading and Method overriding but first let's clear this thing what is Method overload what is method of loading in now this is clear to you guys next is what is method overriding okay now here see we have only one class within one class we are having different many methods with same name but with a different argument different number of argument different number of parameters right in method overriding there must be two classes so method overriding is used in implemented in inheritance one okay so we have a parent class in parent class we have a method the same method is in child class but child class defines the same method in its own way method name is same parameter number of parameters the number of arguments are also same method name same number of arguments same in method overriding okay so how these methods are different because they're differing in location these methods are in different classes one is in Period class one is in child class okay let's comment out these thing and okay let's create a class like we have a class father okay and father we have a function sleep so like a father for father sleeping time is or sleeps from 10 pm to 5am and let's see we have one more uh method we can say like eat and just nothing it's less just eating we are printing just eating this is parent class and we have one more class that is sun and the sun I'm going to drive from father so now this father is parent class or base class or super class and the Sun is child class or we can say it's a subclass or we can say Drive class okay now Sun is inheriting these two functions automatically because this is Drive class right if you do not write anything here just write pass here and with the help of object of sun suppose object of some uh this creating Ram is equal to object of Sun class and with the help of ram I am going to call sleep so obviously we can call and it will print sleeps from 10 pm to 5km because these sleep and eat both the methods we can call with the help of child class object that is inheritance obviously you know this thing we have discussed this thing but now Sun wants to Define I mean father sleeps at 10 pm but obviously we know nowadays children doesn't sleep at 10 pm sleeping time for sun is it's from 3 AM or you can say 2 A.M to 10 am so Sun wants to Define its own sleeping time sleeps from 2 am to 10 am so sun has its own definition of the sleep this is method overriding method overriding right Sun or the drive class has defined this method accordingly according to itself right although method name and number of parameters same now this time if you will call this sleep then using object of Drive class then sleeps from 2 am to 10 AM it will call its own Sleep Method now you want to inherit the Sleep also then obviously one way we have we have this super function super Dot sleep see super don't sleep it's from father class if you run this then you can print both as you can see here thank you but the thing I want to show is not super it's method overriding so this is overriding so what can be the main difference between uh method overloading and Method overriding see first of all method overloading is compile time polymorphism method overriding is runtime polymer polymorphism why compile time office because at compile time on with the help of number of argument you pass the appropriate method to be cold is decided at compile time only which method is to be cold with the help of these number of parameter this is decided at compile time only that is why it is known as compile time polymorphism why method overriding is known as runtime for morphism bkc we know method name is same number of arguments number of parameters also same so when you run at run time only it decide with help of mro like you are calling this with object of sun class so it's Sun class with lfmro method resolution order we have Sleep Method yes so that is why it is called the Sleep Method would be good if you don't have any Sleep Method here then parent class deep method would be called so it is the salary at runtime which method is to be called so that is why overriding method overriding known as runtime polymorphism okay second difference is what method overloading occurs within a same class within same class we are having multiple method with the same name but different parameters right although in Python we don't have this kind of thing because python doesn't support method overloading so we have only one method okay and Method overriding occurs in two classes it will occur in inheritance okay that is must parent class and there should be in one parent class there should be one parent class and one child class okay two difference third is what in method overloading method must have same name but different number of parameters in method overriding methods must have same name and same number of parameter they differ in location one method is in parent class one method is in child class and last you can say like a python doesn't support method overloading and in method overriding yes python supports method overriding okay so how you can achieve method overloading if python doesn't support this thing with the help of default argument or we can say there is args these type of products right I hope you got the difference between these two and how practically we can achieve this thing overriding so that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
