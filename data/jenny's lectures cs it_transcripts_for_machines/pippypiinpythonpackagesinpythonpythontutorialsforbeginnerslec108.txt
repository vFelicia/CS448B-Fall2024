hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed oops Concept in Python and before that we we have discussed one concept that was modules in Python right so the next topic is packages in Python because modules and packages these are related but before uh discussing packages in detail we will be discussing two small topics that is what is the spip command and what is pypi because that is also important one and sometimes you get confused like like these both are same or different okay so this thing we'll be discussing in this video with the help of practical program I'll show you the role of these two things those commands and then in detail in uh next video we'll see packages right so in simple term if I say then the spip is what it's just a package installer or package manager for python so first we'll be discussing what is package then we'll come to this definition like what is package installer or package manager but first you need to clear one thing like what is a package right in Python so for this let's take a real life example suppose you are going to shift your home and your mom ask you to pack your stuff everything your clothes your books your electronic gadgets and your footwares and everything you have okay now you have to pack that thing so okay now one way is what we can say you have that truck or maybe that one vehicle whatever you have maybe you have hold one truck because you have lots of stuff right and you just put all your all your stuff in that truck directly but obviously that is not a good idea right to shift all your stuff because that definitely it's going to damage and yeah we will not refer that thing okay so that is a case when we write a program then we write everything in that program it in one file only right but the thing is if you have limited stuff then it's okay like if you have small program then it's okay in one file you can write everything any function you have or anything you have you can write down but if you are suppose working on a large project or you are developing a large application right and you have thousands number of lines of code then obviously it's not a good idea to write down everything in one file okay that is why we come to that modular programming approach we divide our program in modules right like like we have discussed in uh previous video And discussing it when we're discussing modules in Python in that case we have taken one example of that project quiz game as you can see here right rather than writing all the things you know under one file a main file py we have divided that project into different different files like we have one database. py file or maybe main py file or you can have three or four files and you can just in your one M Main file you can just import whatever you need from other files so module is just a py file okay it's just a program or py file that you're going to import in other programs or maybe interactively you are going to import some builin modules also we have like random module so in the same program we are writing here just import math or import random and whatever the functions in that module we can use those function in our program right so those are different things those are builin modules and these modules we have defined ourself right for our this project so if you have divided your project a large project in three or four different different files then it's easy to manage that project right I hope you are agree with this thing same comes come you know to that real life example what you will do rather than just putting all your stuff directly to into that truck what we'll do we'll pack our stuff right like we have cartons to pack of stuff so maybe you have like shirts and I have like jeans and like I have night suits and for foot waar like obviously I have like maybe shoes heels and uh uh boots flats and I have my books different different books or I have my toys or all the things I'm going to pack suppose in different different cartons right like this and same maybe for your brother for your sister your mother your father everyone is having their own cartons so obviously there would be many cartons so it's like you can consider these thing as modules like in we have py file right database py Main py quiz game. py quiz brain. py or many py files you are having so these are different different files these are considered as simply nothing but module so you can import these files into one another into different files like into other files right so there are many modules now this is also a case like if there are many many many modules then also it's not possible to handle to keep track of those modules if your application size is going to increase then OB number of modules going to increase and it's not possible to track all the modules right at some point of time after some point of time right so one better idea is what what we can do like we can take one carton right large carton and there in one carton I can just put all these small cartons like shirt jeans stall night suit now clothes is one carton and there the big one and there I'm putting these four cartons right so I'm just grouping similar kind of things in one carton I'm not putting like is it a good idea to put like shirts shoes books in one carton obviously not when we are going to group things then we think about grouping similar kind of items together right so we generally group similar kind of items so we rather than grouping shirt shoes books we put shirt jeans stalles night suit night suit in one carton that's a good idea so it's grouping of modules these are different different modules and we are grouping these modules so this is what a package this is nothing but a package I hope you got now package so packages just a collection of modules the modules which are having similar kind ofun functionalities we group those modules together and that is known as a package so it's nothing just but just a directory or you can say a folder as we see in your laptop also you have folder like if you have many pictures many pics so we just uh you know arrange these pictures in folders like one folder of having pictures then within those folders this is fix So within this I am having like like 2018 P 2019 pic like this till 2023 pic different different folders within this folder also I'm having like one more folder like uh my farewell pick here one more folder like maybe road trip here maybe one more folder and uh like maybe jao trip or any other thing and within this we are having actual picks right so we are arranging these things these picture in a structured way so that we can access these thing easily right that's why we use these kind of structure folder folder folder then actual item the files we can say so same here packages are just like this a directory or you can say it's a folder to structure the modules or the files in a better way so that we can access easily access these files right so now and there is one more module like this all the like shoes heels boots flats we can just take a big carton and there I can like Footwear I can just try down on that carton Footwear and there I can put these boxes like this and maybe one for books one for toys like this different different right so like this this is a module maybe module toys is a module simply right or within books also suppose books is a package and there I have two modules maybe your fiction books nonfiction books and these kind of things right or maybe your subjectwise books you can arrange like this so I hope you got a general idea of what is a package package is just a collection of modules or not just collection of modules collection of modules as as well as sub packages so I have something like this two packages let's take this example only small example only two things Footwear and clothes so these two are packages and here I'm having one more package maybe like uh shifting items and maybe my name Jen so I have one more carton there I'm putting these two things and Within These I'm having these things so these are what see the hierarchy modules this is what now a sub package and this is what a package so package a collection of modules like this or maybe it's a collection of like this package is a collection of sub packages so collection of modules as well as we can say collection of sub packag and modules like this right I hope you got what is a package and what is need of package right and see generally a package is a collection of like modules let's take this package clothes collection modules so we can say this means um these this package modules are bound together by your name package name and we can reference these module by this package name like clothes do shorts so like if you write short do py like in terms of programming so this the these files are modules this is a package right so it's a directory or just a folder okay and the the package can contain sub packages to an arbitrary depth fine pack this is a package sub package within this also we can have a package within that also we can have a package package package like this this this is possible so I hope you got what is a package now in Python we have many packages inbuilt packages and as well as we can Define your own packages okay so how to install those in built packages like pandas like or when these packages are published basically that is known as we can say it's a library okay and many users like write packages and they publish so there is a repository that is this pypi python package index there they're going to it's just a repository okay so you can write your package you can submit you can publish your package in this Repository and from this repository anyone can install or access the package okay so rather than writing the code from scratch if anyone any other has done that thing any other has written the code for that thing so we can directly use that code we can directly import that package we can directly install that package and we can directly use that so it is going to make a programmers developers life easy definitely right so this is that repository and using p command we can install that package so it's a package installer or package manager for python right by default it searches this repository first and it and more than two lakhs packages are there in this repository main main like you I hope you have heard these name nay pandas request right and um kinder so these packages we will work these packages also and I I'm going to show you how to install these packages right so PP just like um like you your mother ask you to like uh to go to supermarket and bring some maybe bread then eggs then maybe fruits you go to supermarket you just bring that eggs and you put that those eggs in refrigerator you bring that bread sometime you put you bring vegetables you bring fruits like this right so you are like a package in installer or package manager for your home you will go and search where you will find that item wherever you will find that item you will purchase and you will install or you will you know bring that item to your home like this also pip is also that thing pip is going to install going to search first that package you want to install in this repository by default search there and just bring that or just install that package to your laptop to your laptop right I hope you got what is PIP now what is this package installer means or package manager means fine so these are external packages right we are going to install those packages let me show you practically these things we are going to work in command prompt to you know see the use of this pip command and all you can just open your command prompt like I have written here search bar like command prompt and just click on command prompt right now this is the thing here okay now how how to install external packages right you know the name of that package like like pandas numai whatever package you want to install you know the name right so now I'm I'm going to install that those packages so first you need to make sure that that pip command is working on your this uh know python interpreter so let's check that thing if you want to check first the python version then just write out the python and hyphen hyphen like Dash these two dashes and version so I have 3.10 uh 3.1.8 right now make sure p is working so how to make sure let's write down this thing Python and hyphen M this is the syntax hyphen M pip let's run this yeah see it's working see you you got the uh you know description of this pip the command what commands you can use with this pip install download uninstall freeze right if you want to install something install packages then you have to use this command install right download download packages uninstall you can uninstall list list install packages so these are some commands right and these are some options with Pip if you are getting any error then it means you have to install first the splp right if you have downloaded python from python.org then it is automatically installed on your laptop right like in my laptop I have installed python from python.org so it's being already automatically installed in my python so I haven't installed this pip separately so if you are facing any difficulty you can let me know in comment section and we can make a different you know video to install that pip on your laptop and what kind of ha you are getting you can let let me know in comment section so now now you have to install packages so for that thing you have to do you have to write down pip and then install and then the package name suppose I want to install uh pandas so this Library pandas so let's run this and actually see it is showing requirement already satisfied because I have already installed pandas on my laptop I have this package this Library if you're not having then definitely it is going to take some time 1 minute around and it will install everything you can run this command and it it will run fine if you have Pip installed correctly right so if I show you let me just uninstall this thing or let me just show you the list of packages I have so pip list and see I have numai pandas setup tools and these things I have already right if I want to uninstall then pip uninstall pandas so see uninstalling pandas and uh proceed yes sucessfully uninstalled now if I install again this pandas so see as you can see it is installing my collected packages pandas so it is running so what you need to do you just have to write down pip install and the package name right and these packages are there in Python uh package index pypi it is a repository you can just maybe search Pi pypi packages and see the first one you can go for this pypi dog and there you can you can browse project or you can search like based on this classifier you can just based on topic you can just maybe uh you can apply some filters and based on that you will get these libraries right so if any on anyone you will get see this is the command you install you can install this thing right and this project description is also there what it is going to do fine now if I want to use pandas then just start your python interpretor just write by writing down this python see the version here and now three these symbols are there now means I am in my python interpreter and I can just import pandas now it will not give any error because I have now installed pandas right so it is not going to give any error and see you're not getting any error so anything you're like I want to print high something like this maybe so it will print high right and you can import the packages same you are in the same way you are importing modules like import and package name simple right so I hope you got now idea about a little bit idea about what is a package and what is pip and what is this pypi right now in the next video we'll see in this video we have seen those external packages someone has already built those packages and we are going to install that and use those packages now we can Define your own packages right so that thing we'll see in next video how to create your own package so now I'll see you in the next Tut byebye take care
