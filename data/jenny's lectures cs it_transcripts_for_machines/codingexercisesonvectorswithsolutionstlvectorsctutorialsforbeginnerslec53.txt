hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing vectors in C++ in the previous video we have seen different different functions what we can perform on vectors the member functions right now uh we'll be seeing two to three problems like you can say coding exercises on vectors right so these are three uh questions first this is the vector from 1 to 10 and you have to erase all the even numbers from this Vector right in next question we have two vectors and you have to swap the values of these two vectors next is this is the vector and you have to sort this Vector right so take the screenshot of these three questions pause the video and try this out right now now before jumping to the solution I just want to share an exciting news for all the gate aspirant see yesterday there was an event of unacademy gate Champions conclave 2024 the link of that event also I have shared on my Instagram story day before yesterday and in my telegram uh Channel also I hope many of you you have joined their live stream and you have watched that event it was a great event where they have invited all the top rankers great rankers all India rank one all India rank three who were students of an Academy of all the branches right so maybe you can also be a part of this kind of event maybe next year just by starting from the you know best of the Educators in the industry with an academy so here comes what is the exciting news because unacademy is conducting a unacademy scholarship test for gate 2025 on 24th of March at 1100 a.m. and time limit would be 45 minutes and you will get question in this test and this was to curated by their top Educators right and you can enroll for this test freely this is the best part you don't need to pay anything to take this test right plus one more thing what is so special about this test you have a chance to win up to 100% scholarship and some other rewards also like you have a chance to win Amazon vouchers worth worth rupes th000 monthly free test with 30 practice questions so how to enroll for this test enrollment link I'll put in the description box of this video just click on that link and this type of page will be open in front of you right you just have have to enter your mobile number and when whenever you click on enroll for free you'll get an OTP and just verify on that thing right you just verify the OTP so if you want to prepare for gate 2025 better to start early so all the U relevant link and detail I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's get back to the solution part of our question so I hope you have done these three exercises two are very simple one is little bit difficult the first one if not it's okay let's try this out so we're going to create a new file first so Vector values are given from 1 to 10 and you have to erase only even numbers so yeah we have a function number function erase we can use that in CPP uh sorry in C++ in STL we have this function eras right so you can pass here like a position the position on which you want to delete the element right right itat position or in a Range also we can pass from first to last the first is included last one is not included right okay so for even we have to find out first like even we will first make an iterator okay because you have to iterator is like obviously is going to point the element so iterator will will give us the position the location right and in erase function we pass obviously the position iterator right so let's create an first for the vector v and which is of type int right so same type we are going to take then this and iterator let's suppose the name I'm taking it or any name you can take righty okay not righty right fine now let's suppose this it this iterator is at first we are pointing this to the vector v dot begin in beginning right now the cator is pointing to here right so find out the even number and erase those number so we'll do let's take a y Loop while this iterator not equal to V do end till then obviously we are going to repeat this while loop right now what in while loop we will do so let's check if if the iterator which is pointing to the location on that location if the value is even and how to check mode 2 is equal to equal to Z if the value is even then delete it otherwise just increase just you can say increment the iterator right okay if now how to get the uh value from uh that location we have a d referencing operator S2 if estri it so it will give us the value right mode 2 = to equal to0 if this is the case then only we'll call erase function means on this Vector let's call erase and in erase we just pass the iterator means from this position you have to delete the element otherwise we are going to just do what increment the iterator it ++ if erase that element like if iterator is at two then it will it is going to erase this element to right in that case no it ++ because after erasing this element has been destroyed and these all these elements would be repositioned relocated so three would be here four would be here here like one position before right so no need to increment the iterator after two now iterator is here and it is pointing to three right but that if it is not even number like one it is at first at one but this is not even number so increment the now it is at two right then erase it okay I hope you got this so you can just dry run this thing write down this code on a piece of paper and dry run this and after that just print the vector so we we have many method to print the vector one more we'll discuss in this video that I think we have forgot to discuss we can use a range based for Loop right so Auto means it it will automatically detect the data type suppose I'm taking uh any variable name n and from vector v or Auto element here anything a BC element or anything right but this is from where you want to take the values from Vector the name is V so here should be V right now one by one we are going to print C out just n with some space right so at first you know the working of range based for loop from V first the one first element would be assigned to this variable n then one would be printed the next element next element next element till the end of that container obviously Vector is a container so let's run this I hope it works okay I just selected that thing let's run this see 1 3 5 7 9 all even number has been erased right I hope you got this this was not so much stuff let's try now the second one so these two Vector we have and you have to swap the values of these things so simply we have a member function swap you can just check out here uh I think uh we haven't discussed this swap in previous video so let's discuss this thing it is going to exchange the the content of container by the content of X which is another Vector object of the same type size May differ right okay if you're not getting in simple definition we are going to swap the element of vector one with Vector 2 or vector 2 with Vector one you can say like this right so let's call this suppose on Vector one or vector 2 we can call vect 1 dot Swap and in bracket with which Vector I want to swap vect two and simply print for Vector one and Vector two range based for Loop we can take we can use or iterator we can use or anything we can use using at you can uh access all the elements at function many ways are there to access the values of these vectors so just call Swap and we are just printing using range range based function these two vectors let's run this and see what you are getting okay let's just write down Vector one and Vector 2 after swap so that you can just you can understand it okay let's just use a slash and here or andle you can use see Vector one after swap is this Vector two after swap is this but before swapping this 1 2 3 4 this was Vector one this was Vector 2 so it's very simple right now third sorting just call an algorithm Sol but for that we have to include another header which is algorithm this header here we we have all those algorithms searching sorting and all right so so for sorting also you don't need to write down the complete code for sorting right we simply have a function a m function sort you can just call that and this Vector would be sorted so this is like beauty of using STL right it is going to save a lot of your time right so just call this C sort but if you do not include this algorithm sorry this header we are not able to use this sort see s o r t there is no sort right now so you have to include this header algorithm to use all the algorithms right from that STM sort and what is the syntax from beginning to end you want to sort right see random excess of uh iterator first and then last so from beginning to end so from V the vector name is here vect one so vect 1 dot begin from begin to V sorry 1 dot end from beginning to end we want to perform sorting and simply we can just print the vector one the values of all the vector one after sorting let's run this and see what output you are getting here see 1 2 4 10 60 79 sorted Vector right so these I think two was very simple right first one was a little bit tricky and obviously this one we haven't discussed swep and SW that is why we have we have discussed right now the coding exercises on these algorithms and these member function right I hope you got this right so that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next video then byebye take care
