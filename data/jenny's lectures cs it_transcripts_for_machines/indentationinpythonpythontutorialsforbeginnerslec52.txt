so the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen Loop control statement uh break uh continuant pass right next thing is it's a small topic but it's very important when it comes to Python language what is indentation right what is indentation why it is so important in Python it's not so much important in other languages but in Python it's mandatory and essential concept you have to follow the indentation rule while you are writing a python code right now what is indentation it is C if you write like if statement or four statement these kind of things then suppose I'm writing four four I in range a simple example five and then once you will hit enter then automatically in editors like in those we can say we are working in pie chart ID automatically cursor would be here it will leave some white spaces and here suppose we are writing print hi right so this line would be a part of this four right this white space this white space these white spaces at the beginning of the line is known as indentation simply right now why this indentation is so important see these spaces and by default these spaces in Python is wrote four spaces one two three four or you can see one tab right four spaces now so these four spaces or you can say one tab right now why this indentation is so important see in other languages if you write for Loop or if statement like in C if you write for Loop then four like I is equal to 0 I less than same if I am writing less than equal to 4 and I plus plus and there we use these braces curly braces to indicate a block of code means this is blue body this is block of code so here I can write something like print hi or I'm again adding print two statements means these two statements are one block of code so this is a block of code under this for Loop right so when you are you want to indicate a block of code in other languages C C plus plus Java we use these braces right in these languages if you use this indentation that is just for readability purpose or you can say it's just a decoration item right to decorate your program to look at better but in Python indentation is a mandatory concept you have to follow this when you are writing a python code because in Python this indentation indicate is used to indicate a block of code there is no braces here right so here how to indicate suppose these two lines hi Jenny I won't within this for Loop so these two lines should be indented means this indentation indicate that this is a block of code in Python right and within a same block of code like these two statements are within this code block so these two lines or whatever lines will have one two three four five six lines all the lines should be should have same number of indentation right like here we have four spaces every line should have four spaces four spaces four spaces if you write something like this if you write this print here here Jenny suppose one two three spaces before the sine four spaces before this line then also it will give indentation error wrong indentation right because every line within this four four you know for Loop or within a same block should be should have same number of indentation right now usually we have four spaces by default right but it's up to user four spaces eight spaces seven spaces but at least once space should be there if you don't want to use four spaces just put one space after this four Loop one space and right print high one space print Journey that would also be considered as indented block right so I hope now you go why indentation is so important in Python it is used to indicate a block of code because in Python we don't have these kind of curly braces to indicate a block of code right and one more thing the first line of the Python code cannot be indented suppose the very first line in the Python program I am suppose writing like a variable a is equal to 5. and if you have put some space before this line suppose one space it will give error so first line should not be indented in Python right let me just show you with the help of program okay so let's create a new file here indentation dot sorry Dot py right so let's take save like I'm taking a four Loop or I in like range 5. all right see once you will enter my cursor is here now if I enter Then by default here in ide it will give you cursor here with four spaces right indented so here I'll be writing like print hi to statement print Jenny so this white space this white space at the beginning of these lines or the code or statement that is known as indentation now it is indicating that these two lines are within a within same block of code and that is under this for Loop right this is the body of the loop so basically we use indentation to indicate a block we use in this when you are defining a function or if well statements or for Loop there we have to define a block so that is what let's let's run this see hi Jenny it will print five times and if suppose I am not you know putting any indent on this line that is fine it's okay now this line would be considered as a part of this four Loop of the body so this line this line is one code block and this 4 and print these line the first line and the third line these are Under the same block of code right because they are at same intent because there is no intent in this line so high would be printed five time and then ultimately Jenny would be printed only one time right but if I put suppose two space and here we have only here we have four spaces here we have two spaces so the number of spaces are not equal in these lines so that will give you an error see indentation error an intent does not match any outer indentational level because this line this line is having four in you what a four spaces and this line is having two spaces so before that there is no line which is having two spaces this for Loop is having zero space you know at the beginning before starting off this line and by default these are four spaces and in Python for indentation it is preferred to use spaces rather than tabs in Python language right okay when you will go for the in that python dot you know orj website in documentation you will get in tabs and spaces in that you know under that thing that in Python you should use white spaces rather than tabs too uh to give some indentation in your program right same if if I write here another block like if I'm writing a condition if I equal to equal to 3. then see again cursor is indented further indented now we have eight spaces right suppose print welcome right and after this I am printing print bar take care this line so let us run this and see hi Jenny would be printed right this this range will generate 0 1 2 3 4. so for zero highs and it would be printed then for one then for two three times then once I becomes three it also print welcome because this condition is also satisfied so it will go under this block under this block we have only one statement welcome would be printed then again for 4 till the end of the this range it will print hi Jenny and then bye take care right so see further it is having now eight spaces so it is further indented if within this I'm again writing if like true although it doesn't make any sense because true is always true but just to show you the intensity once you will enter here then this line is again indented again four spaces then four spaces then again four spaces right means here we are having 12 spaces so this is what indentation will give you indicate a block of code this block these two lines are in the same look sorry these three lines because if is also the one two three the second third and fourth line are having same indentation so these are Under same low then this these two lines are under same log because same indentation level is there then if we write like print hello so now this line is Within a new block right like this so I hope you got you know basic idea about indentation and why this is so important in Python so I hope you got what it what is indentation in Python and why this is so important in Python language right now from the next video we'll be working on a exercise that is on a game basically Hangman game so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
