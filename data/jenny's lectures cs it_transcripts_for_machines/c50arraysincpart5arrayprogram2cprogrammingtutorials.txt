in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing arrays some problems on arrays and in the previous video I have discussed a simple program in this video I'll discuss one more program first of all the logic on the Whiteboard then I'll show you the output on my laptop right the program is what you have to write a program to read sum of five students and I'm going to take five only you can take 10 15 or 50 students then calculate sum and average of the marks using arrays right so now first of all we will read marks of five students right I'm not writing the complete program like header file and all I'll show you that thing on my uh laptop I'm just writing from the main function right so now you have to declare array I'm taking what marks name of the array is marks because we are taking marks of how many students sizes five right now we have to calculate sum and average if you calculate sum or average then you have to take two variables also to store these values and then to print if you have to take two variables uh like you have to what declare two variables first is sum now we are going to sum all the you know what five elements of the array the marks of five students so first of all we will see what we will uh initialize the sum with the zero otherwise it will take any garbage value and it is not going to give you the correct plus one another variable is average that it now read how to read five student marks of five students just write down a for Loop and using scanner function I hope you are clear with this syntax now here not you will not write a the the name of the is marks marks of I and that's it now we have to do what sum now suppose this is our array name is what marks five student marks index would be 1 2 3 4 5 address would be something like first of all uh let's take 100 only then 4 then 8 12 and for this element 16 and I'm entering marks of five students using this four loop I I I hope no need to explain this logic again because I have already discussed in previous videos so directly I'm entering the marks suppose here marks are 10 20 15 and uh 205 and uh 7 so marks is array name and it is going to store Base address means the first element address that is 100 so it is going to point here this is internal pointer right so now that's it till then we have just completed the working of this this program now how to do some of these elements see obviously to do sum we have to first of all access these elements and uh with that accessing we will do some so for accessing one more for loop from 0 to less than five and i++ and here only we are not going to print these we are just going doing what some of these elements first of all we will exess 10 then 20 then we will do sum that is 30 then 50 15 15 would be added here that is 45 then 25 would be added in this like this right so now what you can do in sum we are going to store what whatever the sum of these arrays so in this we are going to store so sum equal to now what you will write here see just add What In Sum whatever the value in sum there we will add these values one by one right so have you access these values name of the array and index is I and I would be from 1 by one we will exess I would be 0 to 5 so this this this this and this and the value would be added to sum and the final sum would be again in the the the sum variable this is how you will calculate the sum after calculating sum we will do what average so in average variable we are going to store average how to calculate average the the sum means total divide by divide by total number of dat items total number of students are five so Su divide by five right and now you can simply print what you want to print sum or average if you want to print both two print it here I'm going to print average so percentage D better to take what percentage F because average would be always be in what the decimal form it would not be like exact integer if you take take integer average then it will what round off it will print only the integer form of that average so better to take float average and here to print float direct use what percentage F that I'll show you on my laptop here simply I'm using percentage D and what I'm going to print average and that's it now see the working of this form because we have already discussed the working till this right we have entered now this one I would be c i variable first of all value would be zero it is going to take any address like address would be suppose 1,000 in memory condition true we will enter here now what is this sum is equal to sum plus Marx I first of all this would be calculated and whatever the value in the right side that would be assigned to the sum so now sum Plus in sum we have zero first of all 0 plus marks of I right marks is a name I is what zero Marx of Zer this is how we are going to access the first element marks of zero means this would be accessed I hope you know how to access like we have discussed in previous video that uh that um formula is what Base address plus I into size of int int why int because I'm taking array of integer type marks of zero 10 would be exist and 0 + 10 that is what 10 now 10 would be assigned to this sum right so when this this compiler will compile this line what a variable in memory would be created sum and first of all the value was Zero now the value of the sum is 10 and what another variable that is average right and it is containing any garbage value right three variables we have declared suppose it is having any address 2,000 it is having address 3,000 any address right so now I ++ now I becomes 1 condition again true again enter here sum plus marks I now sum is what Su value is what now 10 now 10 plus Marx of I I value is 1 marks of one now address of this one this element would be calculated using this address using this formula and how to access and now we will access this thing so here we have 20 so now 20 would be added now it becomes 30 and 30 would be assigned to again sum so now the sum this value will be overwritten with what 30 I I hope now you got why I'm taking Su is equal to0 first of all because at first Su plus 0 if you will not initialize it with the zero then it would take any garbage value and that in that garbage value 10 would be added so you'll not get the correct result right uh now sum is 30 two elements 20 + 10 30 yeah fine I ++ now I becomes what 2 condition true again enter sum now sum is what 30 so first of all from this variable data would be F like 30 plus Marx of I I is what what now two Marx of two this 15 would be added now it becomes what 45 now 45 45 would be stored in this sum I hope you got the working now you can do for what IAL 3 IAL 4 and once I becomes five condition is not true we will go out of the loop till then some what what whatever what value would be there here in sum sum of all these elements would be what I think sum would be 77 I think maybe it's wrong now next line is this thing average is equal to sum by 5 sum is equal to what 77 by 5 whatever value would be calculated that would be assigned to this average here in this data that would be in floating point right so now better to take here float and for float we are going to print posi as F so whatever the average here whatever this value in this variable average that would be printed if you want to print sum then also you can print here sum right so this is how I guess you got how to do sum of all the elements of array right a proper example I have done this if a simple program is like how to do some of elements of all the the all the elements of the array then simply you can do that program also right because this is how we are doing some right using arrays like 1D array I hope you got this one now let me show you this thing on my laptop so now let me create one more file for this I'm taking uh name marks to C okay header file first of all then we'll write what main function and here I'm going to take what marks so AR name I'm taking marks and five students you can take 10 or 15 it's up to you right and one more variable I for loops and we are going to calculate sum and average so we'll take sum equal to zero and one variable that is average okay fine now enter the marks of students so we will enter how using a full loop right and uh scanf percentage D so here we'll write address of array name is Max and here we will write I fine now we are going to calculate sum of all the marks right so here what you will write in one more for Loop we will write what I is equal to 0 I less than 5 and i++ because we have to access all the five elements and then we will do sum what we will write sum equal to sum plus how to access elements of this array name of the array and index I right and after calculating the sum this outside of this for Loop now we will calculate what average average equal to what sum what the formula is divide by total number of students that is we have five students and that's it and now I'm going to print uh suppose sum equal to it's float so percentage F format specifier and sum and uh print f slash in for new line average equal to that is also percentage F and the name is AVG right that's it let me save it and let me just run it now I hope it will give you correct output so it is going to ask enter marks of five students we haven't written the line like enter the marks of five students so it is not going to print that line directly you have to enter marks so for Simplicity purpose I'm just entering marks what five five 5 5 5 5 * 5 sum should be 25 and average should be five sum are sum and average these are in float that is why after point point valuable see you can see 25 Point till six digit digit it is going to print for float right now uh you can also write here here for better understanding before the for Loop enter marks of five students and now it will ask when you will run it let me save it then it will ask now you will get it better see enter marks of five students so now let me enter marks again uh like 34 56 78 9 1 these are five students and marks 178 point this and average is this one so I hope you are getting my point if you want to take marks also in floating point you can take what a float type of array here just you have to write down rather than in float marks right and in scanf also what percent is f because it is floating point and and uh any other change no other change so let me just save it and let me run it sorry this I should be see it is giving error this I should be integer so let me declare this I in another line int I because I value is like we are taking from 0 to fight so now let me save it and now let me run it uh what error it is giving okay this float 0.0 so now let me save it and let me just run it see it is asking marks of five students now I'm entering 2345 56 78.9 99.4 okay 56.7 and see sum is this and average is this one so you can take integer or float it's up to you better to take float right so now that's it so now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see like read elements of array like 10 elements of array and in that elements count how many OD numbers and how many even numbers and then print so we'll see this program next video and I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
