hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen how to add methods to your class right so now till now we have discussed how to create your class how to create object of that class how to add attributes and how to add methods to the class right now based on that whatever you have learned till now based on that we'll be doing one exercise in this video right and after that in further videos we will continue with the advanced concepts right of objectoriented programming right right so the question is that is very simple one you have to calculate area of circle and circumference of circle area and circumference of circle right and that you will use which approach you'll use object oriented programming approach means you have to create class objects and then you have to find out the area and circumference of circle yeah although you can do this without using this classes and object concept but that is different one VR now we are focusing on OB concept so given a simple example we will do with the help of classes and object concept right then only you will you know you'll be it will be easy for you to understand the concept and it will be easy for you to apply these Concepts to a larger project right okay now just pause the video and try to find out the area and circle circumference of a circle right okay so I hope you have done this uh this project sorry this exercise so let's create a new file like Circle exercise dot p y and we are creating a class first and the name of the class is circle with C Capital right so let's take this init function and what you need for area and circumference one we need pi and one we need is like radius right so Pi is we know for all the circles pi value is same 3.14 so I have told you one concept that is class object attribute right outside of this init function we Define that attribute so Pi is equal to 3.14 so here Pi is our class object attributes so for all the objects you created for every instance you create from this class the pi value would be same 3.14 that is why I am taking this as a class object attribute and what we you need is radius so let's take a parameter radius so self Dot attribute name I'm taking same as parameter name you can take different name also self dot radius equal to and whatever the value of this parameter whatever whatever value pass as an argument that would be assigned to the self dot radius this attribute right so see as you can see here we have radius because we have a parameter named radius from there we will get the value radius right or you can simply here put R if you put here r then yes you should put R so this and this the name should be save this name cell node after you know self load after this you take any attribute name right so I'm just taking now let's define a function circumference right and what is the formula of circumference 2 pi r so the formula is 2 into pi value so pi value means you cannot directly write down here Pi if you write down here Pi directly Pi into radius so radius is obviously the attribute of the circle so how to access self Dot radius right maybe you think Pi is class object attribute so no need to write down cell so whatever the circumference we will let's store this in a circum variable and let's return this variable return whatever the value or rather than two lines in single line also we can write down this thing rather than this line just remove this and here only just write down that is also fine return 2 into Pi into self root radius right maybe you think it's right let's see now let's create obviously an object suppose Circle one I am creating is equal to the name of the classes Circle this is the way you create and you need to pass what one parameter radius so I am passing here 4. and I'm just printing because this function is returning the value so if how you will call this function circumference or better to name this get circumference right how we will call this on this on this instance of this class the name of the instance the name of the object Circle one dot get circumference right so whatever it will return either you can store that in a variable and then you can print that variable otherwise in one line only you can do that task and simply write down here print print whatever it will return that would be printed I hope it's right but it's not let's run this and I will show you what error you will get here see in line number eight here we are calling this method and see not function we'll call these methods right now this method is in line number six in line number eight we are calling and in line number six we are defining this function this method so name Pi is not defined although Pi is a class object attribute it would be same the value of pi would be same for each you can say object but when you call this get circumference using this object Circle one don't get circumference dot this so I need Pi for this circle and Pi for this circle how you can get using self load pi right self toad Pi now let's run this see 25.12 right if I say if I write something like this if you provide default value like radius is equal to maybe 5. or maybe like six so here if you do not provide any argument then also it's fine because by default radius is equal to 6 so it will take radius 6 and it will give you the result right and if you provide any value like 4 I am providing then it will override this value 6 now this time I am providing the value 4 so radius would be equivalent to 4 now so see the answer is 25.12 right so this is also fine right this I hope you got why I'm writing yourself dot PI right if I create another Circle and for this the value of uh what we can say this radius is 14. so now on Circle 2 let's call this function get circumference and whatever it will return we are going to print that thing right so let's run this now we will get two circumference 87.92 25.12 right so when you are calling this function on Circle 2 then it will it will it is you know pointing to self growth pi means pi value for the circle and at this point of time pi value for Circle one that is why we are writing cell dot Pi cell dot Pi not just Pi one more thing rather than cell group Pi if Pi is a class object attribute right then somewhere it is also written rather than self we can write down the name of the class Circle dot pi that is also fine let's run this and see we will get the result so like why we are writing this one Circle dot Pi because it will differentiate if anybody will see like I have I'm having 50 maybe methods in my class so wherever you will write the class name dot any variable name then yeah he or she will have an idea like this is in class object attribute and the value of this object is same for every instance thanks so that is why we it's better to write if you are using a class object attribute better to access that attribute with the help of name of the class or self node Pi which we can write that is also fine and one more thing for area also same you can create another method right so like def get area and all so this thing is your assignment you need to do right you have to define a function get area and you include that thing another way is just I want to show you like I am passing here only one parameter radius all right it's not like that if you are passing only one parameter then that reviewed for the object or the attribute in this class would be only one and if I pass here two parameter then two attribute no I am passing only one parameter but still attribute of the object can be more like area so self load area I'm creating another attribute self note area equal to now area is pi R square right so pi not Pi we will write like Circle dot Pi because it's class object attribute pi R square so no no need to write cell plot radius self load radius because we are simply taking the value from this parameter radius so simply here write down radius Pi R square radius into radius right so if you here want to print the area as well see Circle one two now as you can see we can access this radius pi and area as well as and obviously here see can you see this pink round pink circle and here we have it an m means this is what method and it is what method and this F f is like maybe you said these are attributes so it should be a here but f means like it is in yellow then these are fields okay so these are radius Pi area these are Fields okay now I can access this area Circle one root areas element let's run this so this is what this is the area of the circle 50. right or if you want to print like this like this using a string we can write down this thing so let's run this and now see it's a comparison of circle one is this circle two is this and the area of circle one is 50 like this right so now one assignment for you is you need to find out area of a rectangle right that is your assignment like this you can you know do some exercises like area of square rectangle or triangle or any other things right these things you can try but from my side your assignment is you have to find out area of rectangle you can write down that logic in comment section fine so now I think that's it about like the basics of methods and all I hope you got the idea of attribute methods class object self keyword class object attribute init function and all how to define a method and all right how to access the methods and attributes of a class with the help of object right so now I'll see you in the next video bye take care
