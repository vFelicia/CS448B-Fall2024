hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so I have told you that I'm going to conduct a CH session right and I have asked you to ask me the questions you have and I got many questions almost 120 around questions right so I have picked few questions because see it's not possible to answer all the questions in uh like this kind of video so I'm first of all I'm so sorry if your question has not been selected in this Q&A session but I'm planning to conduct this type of session every week so better luck next time okay now let's start without any further delay let's start answering your questions so the first one is what would you suggest to one who is going to complete School this year and has high goodness to be your software engineer okay so the one advice I want to give you is what don't think you have much time because generally in first year student think what time in second year also fin but you don't have much time don't think this you have much time please don't waste your time during those three or four year your graduation years try to utilize those years fully work on yourself improve yourself upskill yourself right so you don't have much time and have to grow logical thinking and improving Python programming language in simple way see you can check out my course Python Programming python course that's very simple and Rib do how to grow logical thinking I have uploaded two or three videos you can go to my channel you can go to the playlist placement series and there you will get these kind of videos right but in simple term if I say then what you can do just go for concept try to you know uh solve as many question as you can if you have a problem understand the problem first and on a pen and paper write down the solution dry run that code then jump to your laptop to run that code right the dry step that is very important and that is I guess the most underestimated step but that's very crucial if you want to build your logic build you know this logic thinking logic building skill right so please Dy in your code I think for me it had worked you know this step it worked magically right when are you going to take SQL SQL okay J Shri see I'm not so good in SQL to be very honest so first I learn that then I'll teach you right and it is going to take time what is your qualification I'm M Tech gate and net qualify M please make WhatsApp Channel already created there I have already you know uh posted that link as well in community post and on my Instagram also in the story you will get that link but yeah one thing I'm getting many I have posted that link on my Instagram and I'm getting many messages like user not found link is not working Ma'am so the problem is I guess maybe you haven't updated your phone or Whatsapp or maybe for you it is it has not been started this channel service okay it's not for everyone right now so WhatsApp is working on that so definitely maybe in few days you will get this thing and I have started posting the notes also in that link so you must visites development starting that you have to figure it out I would recom Cy ma'am I want to ask how to grate in third third year first attempt and which is best coing toate see cracking gate is not so much tough yeah to be very honest if you're an average student and you devote you know a decent time to you know study for gate for all you are you studying those subject regularly and you are sincere then you can easily crack gate exam but your moto should be how to be in top at least 100 so first of all think big and then start doing okay worried about that please let me know in com watchet who is your favorite player no I don't ma'am I unable to write the code without taking any help please me how I Oram this see it happens with everyone in starting day so don't worry okay but try to to write try to think the logic right understand the problem first fully understand the problem each word of the problem right when you solve questions on that type of concept 5 10 15 20 questions then definitely you will able to get how to think the logic how to think the solution of that problem start with basic questions okay not directly go jump to you know difficult questions fine if you're able to solve the simple questions that definitely it is going to boost up your confidence right so uh you know understand the problem first and then on a pen and paper with a pen and paper just write down the solution and dry run which is very important line by line dry run that code what answer you will get what output you will get and then jump to your laptop to run that in ID right that dry step I have told you many times it's very important okay yes I'm going to continue that one the basic concept I have covered basic concept okay post notes of python in Channel or Whatsapp yes I have already started here I'm posting notes in Python uh uh the notes of python in my WhatsApp Channel and then I'll post C++ and C notes whatever notes I have I'm going to post in that channel and kindly make a playlist having DSC topic wise I guess I have already created a playlist of DSC you can check out but yeah I'm I'm thinking to you know reupload that those videos in high quality and as well as covering some more topics so I'm going to upgrade my DSA playlist I'm thinking about that right now and what is the message you want to give to your viewers and who was the person to give advice for making a YouTube channel my husband and the message you want to give to your viewers is what don't waste your time invest your time your life work on yourself improve yourself upill yourself so figure out what is good for you rather than watching some random stuff on social media ma'am I'm in I'm bch first year EC Branch stent please ass me first and second semester exam of programming element of Statistics B thir I'm currently learning python from your videos it's very easy to understand you're the best teacher well thank you but element of Statistics subject I can't I'm sorry and please start teaching DSA in C++ in Hindi language for placement because many of us don't English DSA in C++ in Hindi I'm planning to upgrade my DSA playlist actually but that was in English but yeah I have started a Hindi Channel as well Jenny's lectures in Hindi so I'll think about this and I'll try my best if I got time to upload the same lecture in Hindi as well possible for a non programmer student to succeed in programming and get a job on that basis yeah of course it's possible there you can start and you can get a very good job on that basis which language would be first if you a beginner you don't know AB of coding and you want to go for a simple language then go for python otherwise either Java or C++ you can choose see go for any language and the basic building blob in all the languages are same small syntax is different like some operators would be there loops uh conditionals like IFL statement Loops functions these are building blocks of any language and these are almost same the concept only differences in the syntax a little bit so if you're good in any one language then it is very easy for you to switch to any other language and learn that language but for that you have to be very good command on one language right so either you can start python is very simple or Java or C++ can you come to V Val as a speaker you all want to meet J M well thank you but see I would love to but you know these days my schedule is a little bit hectic and you know some things are also going on behind the scene so it's not possible I think Within These two to 3 months but next year definitely I'll think about this and when will you start C++ please take my comment see I have taken your comment soon I think there are 15 to 20 lectures are left in Python then we'll start C++ okay by looking at recent TRS which career path will be good in the sector or recent Trends AI blockchain promt engineering data sence So based on your interest you can choose means your interest as well as your you know capability that is also very important let's go galaxy what is your income tell next question this channel has almost 1.5 million what is your plan to make something great using this these great audience I think I'm already doing great here and what do you mean by this using this great audience you are not any object the subscribers or the fan or the students who support me or who love me these are not any objec I'll use you my motto is just to spread the knowledge I have and to help as many students as I can to teach almost every subject of computer science yeah I'm not teaching like I'm not uploading videos regularly but some things are going on behind the scene that is why but yeah my plan is to upload like every subject everything on my channel freely that's it state harana ma'am are you married if no I love you will you marry me because your teaching style I love the most so that's it for this Q&A session I'm sorry if your question has not been selected in this video maybe in next video better luck next time so now see in the next video then bye bye take care
