so in the series of learning Python programming language in this video we are going to implement our first project what is that project we are going to implement a game rock paper scissor I hope you are aware about the skin the rules and all right if you don't know the rules then you can and if you don't know what is this game how to play this game you can go to the official website and you can check out the rules right so now first of all I'll be telling you the rules the logic some hints how we are going to implement this project right what is the problem statement actual problem statement what I want right then you have to implement it and after that we will discuss I'll show you this thing on my laptop right will be implementing this game right now the rules are C Rock see like this we uh we know that this is what this this thing it's a rock this if the hand is like this then it's paper and if this is the case then this is scissors right so rock wins against scissors scissors win against paper and paper wins against Rock right so suppose me and my friend are playing this game so if I choose if I chose like rock right and my friend chose paper right means paper wins against Rock paper wins against Rock means I am going to lose now right so these are few games now you are going to play this with computer right one thing first of all let's suppose 0 for rogue zero for rock one for paper and two for scissor so first of all what user will enter your choice he'll ask like enter your choice type zero for rock one for paper and two horses right second thing computer will generate a random number computer will choose from rock paper scissor means we can use a random function generate a random number between 0 to 2 0 1 2 like 0 to 2 the range is zero to two computer will generate a number and then we will check we have chosen a number computer have chosen a number then we will compare those numbers we'll check those numbers and we will we are going to tell who is going to win and who will lose right now situation can be like this if nine cases can be their total nine cases this is what users choice and second is computer's choice right so if user enters 0 0 user can choose from 0 1 and 2 and computer can also choose from 0 1 and 2. so suppose user has entered 0 then computer can generate a random number either zero one or two so three cases can be there with zero three cases then one one one again computer can generate either 0 1 and 2. suppose user choice is 2 2 again computer can generate either 0 1 and 2. total nine cases can be there that's it right so now you have to check these nine cases only and based on that you have to put some condition if else if alif statement right now see these cases first this then this and then this if the computer and user choice is same then we simply say it's a draw right one condition is this fine next condition can be there see in this case if user choice is 0 and computer choice is 1 0 means Rock and one means paper means paper is going to win against Rogue so in this case computer wins 0 and 2 if user choice is 0 and computer choice is two in this case 0 means Rock 2 means scissor but Rogue will crash Caesar so Rogue is going to win against scissor so in this case user wins if user Choice has one computer choice is 0 in this case one means paper 0 means Raw so here also user will win right in this case one user choice is one means paper and two means scissor so scissor will win because Caesar will cut the paper so in this case computer will win but if user choice is two and computer choice is 0 0 means Rock and this is Caesar in this case the wins right because rock rock wins against scissor 2 1 2 means scissor and one means what paper so here also two wins like scissor will win so user choice is this so user will win so now I guess based on these rules you can find out who will win now you can put this in the form of a fails right C if this computer choice is one in this case computer will win and in this case also computer will win means one is greater than zero and computer choice is 2 and this is a user choice is one and two is greater than one so means computer the number which computer has generated is greater than the user Choice means computer choice is greater than user choice right so in both the cases computer will win so we can put something like this like if this computer choice greater than user Choice One Condition can be there in this case computer when or rather than computer win we can say you will lose or user will lose that is better so we will say you lose right so these cases we have covered these two cases but now see user choice is one computer choice is zero user choices 2 computer choice is 1 means here user choice is greater than computer choice in this both the cases this and this user will win so second condition can be there if like user choice is greater than computer choice then means these two cases this and this user will win means you will win so we can say like you win so this also we have covered this and this and draw also we have covered if computer Choice equal to equal to user Choice it's a true right now remaining are these two one is this one and one is this one so this also you can put like we are not finding any you know like the number which is greater or less so simply two condition you can put if user choice is zero computer choice is two user win or you win if user choice is to computer choice is zero you lose means computer wins means you lose right so these two condition plus these two condition four condition right plus fifth is what for draw five right Plus if accidentally by mistake user has entered less than zero like minus one or greater than two like three four five in that case what will happen you will say you have entered you have entered a wrong number you lose right so total how many condition you have to put six two one for Row three two these five and one invalid number I think six these six if and alif statement you have to put right that's it but here the order in which you are putting these conditions that also matters right maybe you think first you can put these two condition then these two condition and like then draw condition yeah you can put so try this out but this is very important the order also important here in which order you are putting these conditions and I'll explain I'll tell you why the order important ones will be implementing this thing in laptop but I hope the condition the rules how you can implement this this is clear to you guys right now I guess you can stop this video and you can try this out so I hope you have done this you have tried this out now let's create a new file and rock paper scissors underscore project one dot py right okay now the last from the user first thing the choice I'm taking a variable user choice right and using input function will ask enter your choice right okay now type we have told the user like zero for rock one for paper and two for scissors and we know this input would be in the form of strings so better to convert at this time only and this thing into end because whatever we'll take using uh input function that would be string but we want integer with a zero one or two right now next thing just what we can do computer choice Now using random function what we can generate so for that we have two first of all import random modules we'll do that thing random dot will use a function Rand int and the range is from 0 to 2. this thing we have discussed already right uh how to generate random numbers so first we have to import random module right import random okay now if you want you can print like computer what computer has computer choose and we can simply print like this computer choice this variable right what computer has chosen 0102 now we can put some condition like first let's put that condition row condition if this computer Choice equal to equal to user choice and what we can do you don't need to put these brackets here if you want to put you can put that's okay but in Python you can you know Skip these brackets directly put the condition if this is the case then simply we can print Etc but if this but if this is not the case then we can put alif another condition so two conditions we have discussed like computer choice is greater than user Choice means you are going to lose computer will win so let us suppose put that those conditions first if this computer choice is greater than user choice means we simply print in that case you lose means computer will win and you are going to lose right now okay next is else if this user choice is greater than computer choice in that case you win right these cases we have discussed okay these two conditions we have got now three we have put four draw and four greater than choices now we are remaining with two conditions four zero and two right so next is else if like computer choice is equal to equal to 0 and simply you can put this operator logical and and user Choice equal to equal to 2. in that case we're going to win 0 means Rock 2 means scissor rock wins against scissors so means computer is going to win means you are going to lose so simply print you lose right else if user choice is zero and computer choices two in this case 0 means Rock and 2 means scissors so means rock wins against scissor means user is going to win so means you win so here you win okay I guess we have put all the one two three four five conditions right one is that for invalid number that also will be discussing now let's run this and check if it is working or not okay let's run this so it is asking enter your choice let me enter zero I have entered 0 and computer chose one means zero means Rock and one means paper so obviously you lose because paper wins against frog okay it's working fine let's check for another thing if I am choosing 0 and again computer chose one so you lose fine if I am choosing again zero now see I have chosen 0 0 means Rock and computer chose 2 2 means scissor so who is going to win rock wins against scissor right but means 0 means rock rock means I have chosen Rock So means user should win so it should give the output you win right because see user choice is 0 and computer choice is 2 means it should give output you win but it is telling you you lose means there is something wrong with this code why so it is C first it will check this condition this is not true then it will check this condition the control will move one by one right computer choice is two see this is the number is 2 2 here let me just two and greater than user choice is 0 0 is this condition true 2 greater than 0 yes condition true that is why it will enter into this control statement and it will print you lose but I don't want that e it should enter here I want this condition should be checked 0 and 2. means you have to put this condition before this greater than condition that is what I was telling you the order is order also matters in which order you are putting these conditions right so better to put these two conditions these zero and two conditions before these two conditions these greater than conditions then it will work fine otherwise it will give you wrong output let me just run this for one more input suppose I am giving 2 and computer is choosing one okay that is fine 2 means scissor one means paper so you win okay fine let me show again two and two c two and two it's a draw that is also working fine now again to see now in this case I have entered 2 2 means scissor and computer chose zero zero means Rock wins against scissor rock wins means it should print like computer is going to win means you lose but it is printing you win why so again same thing see one by one it will check these thing so this condition not true okay fine this condition computer choice is zero and user choice is 2 greater than no this is not true so again next condition is now user choice is in this case user choices I have entered two two greater than computer chose zero is this condition true yes so it will print you win but actually you lose so better to put these two conditions these two conditions before these two conditions here here right and after that put these two conditions now this condition draw condition you can put before or after it doesn't matter right now the order is fine let's run this now see if I enter two computer shows one you win okay fine that is working fine if I enter 0 now see if I enter 0 and 0 means Rock 2 means scissor rock wins against scissor means I will win means you win user will win so now it is working fine right why so because first it will check this condition is this true is equal to no computer choice is zero now computer choice is two so this is also not working user Choice third condition user Choice zero yes computer Choice 2 yes this condition is true now it will enter here you win yeah you win right so before checking these greater than these conditions it will check these conditions too okay now one thing let's run this again and I'll show you if I have entered four still it is working fine it is uh you know telling you you win but how because 4 is not a valid number so put this condition also where you will put this condition at starting movie after user enter the choice better at first check if the number is valid or not so after entering here only here only put one condition if this user choice is greater than ah 2 or you can say greater than equal to 3 or user choices Less Than Zero you entered an invalid number and you lose right no need to put further thing if this is the case simply exit otherwise if this is the case then then this ends else we can put this coding in else part right else after that computer will generate a random number and we will compare so better to put this code because in else you have to put indentation so better to put all the code with an indentation right like this otherwise it will give error now in else part we will put all our all thing right now let's run this again so at this time if I enter 4 say you entered invalid number you lose it will do nothing that's it and that is that's exactly I want but now if I want that it should show the images of rock then paper then scissor that is also fine because I have those images let me just copy paste this thing so we have Rock we have paper for paper this image and for scissor we have this thing this image right now I'm going to show okay if user is choosing 0 means Rock so it will show user chose the image Rock like this have we are going to show this see if user choice is greater than this is the case then invalid in else part simply print if you print here user choice this this variable then it will simply print either 0 1 or 2 but I want images right now let's make a list and there I am putting these images Rock paper and scissors okay now we have a list so in here we can simply access the from the list these images according to the user choice so in bracket simply put user choice if user choice is 0 means here we will put 0 so game image is zero zeroth index we have Rock so we are going to access this image right these are what you can say strings rock paper scissor okay now computer chose here also I want images rather than simply that number so game images and in bracket I can simply put computer choice right now let's run this so if I enter 0 now see the output 0 means it will print this image Rock computer chose scissors random number two so it will show like image scissors now rock wins against scissor means you win right so I guess you got this how you can implement this game see one thing if you put this line if you put this line after this like we have chosen and after entering the choice directly I want to print whatever the user has chosen the image of that thing right I don't want to print in this else part right okay this is also not fine let me just run this and show you what output you will get here see if I enter here 4. it will give you an error list index out of range in line number 30 in module this the Sprint game is user Choice list index out of range because now my choice is 4. so here my choice is 4 so user choice is 4 it will print 4 here so game image is 4 but there is no fourth index 0 1 2 only second in only till second index we can access right that is why it will give you that error so rather than printing this here first check if user choice is invalid then just print you lose you have entered invalid number else you can simply show whatever user has chosen the image right now I guess you got this if you haven't got this thing this is very simple it's fine just write down this thing on a paper dry run this thing again see the rules and all right dry run this then again implement this definitely you will get it it's not that tough so I hope you have done this project successfully now in the next video we'll see what are tuples in Python so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
