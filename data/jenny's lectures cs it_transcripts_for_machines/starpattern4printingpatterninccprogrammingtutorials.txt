in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs in c we have discussed many printing pattern programs and in this video i will talk about how to print this pattern first of all we'll discuss the logic on this whiteboard then i'll show you the output on my laptop using base code editor right now first thing when you see the pattern what you have to do you have to just check like number of rows and number of columns right so let me draw it something like this now see here how many number of rows you have to print one two three four five right so one loop is for number of rows so that is i loop will take the variable i i is equal to one here 2 3 4 and 5 right number of columns 1 2 3 9 and this number of columns the group would be j the variable would be j right now here see one loop is to take care of number of rows one loop is we are discussing we will take here three loops one is for these space before printing this star how many spaces in this line four in this line three then two then one here we have zero space right so one loop would take care of these spaces and third loop would be responsible to print these stars so ultimately we would use here three loops right so the outer loop would be what just to take care of what number of lines or number of rows and that loop would be from 1 to 5 here in this case right so now let me write down the logic here first first loop would be i is equal to 1 i less than equal to 5 and i plus plus this says just to take care about the number of lines now within this loop two loops one for space one to print the stars now see when i value is observe the pattern now when i value is 1 in first line how many space 4 then we have one star right in second line three spaces and two star in third line two spaces and three stars in fourth line one space and four star in fifth line zero space and five star although stars are having space between these it's not like conservative stars one star then space then star and space like this we have to print so now see how you can relate this in first line you have to print four spaces in second three in third two then one and then zero so now how can you derive a relation or the condition see this should be what number of rows the space should be total number of rows if i say minus the row number minus i that is the condition that should be the condition so for the first line number of rows are hair five and i value is one five minus one that is four means four spaces should be printed first thin star right for second line number of rows 5 minus for second line high value is 2 and number of spaces should be printed 3 yeah that's true right same for next 5 minus i 3 that is two four three two and four next one and it should be zero for the last so we have five we have found out this should be the condition to print space right so for printing space i am just taking this variable name space only i am not taking any k or something like this space is equal to 1 and what should be the condition space less than equal to what rows minus i this should be the condition and semicolon we don't have space here so i'm writing this in the next line space my plus plus right and in this loop we are going to print only space that's it now after printing space now we have to print star now for that another for loop within this outer loop only right sorry another for loop not printf and the variable i am taking j j is equal to 1 semicolon j less than equal to now c star or the symbol we are printing in first line only one star second line two star third three star fourth fourth star four star and fifth line five star so i guess you are able to relate the condition here i think you can generalize it and you can find out the condition they should be what less than equal to i because in first line j is executing only once for second row j is executing two times for third j is executing three times means exactly equal to the number of uh that the value of i or the value the value of this row number that that is why j should be less than equal to i and j plus plus and here i am printing what star but what you have to take care here star and space we are printing here so it's not like that only star you should print that would give some another pattern one star and one space here and that is what we are going to print in uh in this printer because see one star then space star then space star then space i hope you can see this right and next is in outer loop we are going to print what one more thing that is new line operator slash now let me run this program and show you see it's starting i would be initialized with 1 1 less than equal to 5 condition true we will enter into this loop now space space is a variable we will initialize it with 1. now see the condition 1 less than equal to rows minus i number of rows how many number of rows here here we are taking number of rows fixed that is 5 right so in this case you can also write 5 minus i or if you want the user should enter the number of rows you want to print so simply you can ask from the user here using printf and scanf so user would enter number of rows we are taking a variable name rows we have to declare this variable before using it so now simply yeah in this if you are taking rows so the outer loop would be till number of rows not five i am not going to fix here that is five i am not going to do any hardcoding so we can put here less than equal to uh sorry less than equal to rows right now how many rows suppose i am entering number of rows 5 so here 5 minus i high value is 1 5 minus 1 that is 4 condition 3 yes condition 3 we will enter into this loop and we will print that space here right one space should be printed now space plus plus that is 2 is 2 less than equal to 4 yes condition tree we again enter here print space space plus plus 3 3 less than equal to 4 yes condition true again print space space four four less than equal to four yes condition tree again print space space plus plus five now five less than equal to four no condition is not true now exit from this loop now after this for loop immediately after this four we have another for loop that is for j so now j would be initialized with one now here one less than equal to i value is one one less than equal to one yes condition true enter into this loop and print star and space so a star would be printed and one space would be printed now j plus plus j is 2 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is not true exist from this loop and slashing now control would be here next line right now what we are in now outer loop so i plus plus now i becomes 2 2 less than equal to number of rows yes 2 less than equal to 5 number of rows are 5 two enter here sp space again would be initialized with one now one less than equal to now see this condition is what rows five minus i value is now 2 5 minus 2 that is 3 condition 2 enter here print space space plus plus 2 2 less than equal to 3 yes condition tree again print space 3 3 less than equal to 3 again print space now space is 4 4 less than equal to 3 no we are not printing space exit from the slow and now j would be again again initialized with 1 now 1 less than equal to i value is now 2 yes condition true hair prints star and 1 space hair space now j plus plus j is 2 is 2 less than equal to 2 yes condition true now again enter here and print one space then here star again one space now j is three now condition is not true exit from this loop slash end now control would be here again i plus plus i hope now you got to working off this these four loops right and finally this pattern will be printed right when i value becomes 4 then 5 and ultimately when i value becomes 6 now 6 less than equal to number of rows are 5 condition is not true we will exit from this loop right so now let me show you the working of this on my laptop so now let me create one another file for this pattern seven dot c right and i'm going to copy the previous one only i'm not going to write down the complete coding we have to change a little bit only right so now what you have to change here i j number of rows we have to take in this and one more variable that is space right for third loop so first floof would be same i is equal to one i less than equal to number of rows i plus plus and now here one more for loop what for space space is equal to 1 and space less than equal to what the condition is number of rows minus i the row number and what space plus plus right here it should be space now within this for loop what you will print will just print space that's it right and that's it for this now another loop is j j is less j 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus ok now in this loop what you have to print will just print star star and one space right and printf slash n and that's it now let me run this number of rows you want to print enter 5 and the pattern you can see let me run this again for 10 number of rows now here enter 10 and that's it this is the pattern you want exactly right so i hope you got how to print this pattern now that's it for this video i'll see you now in the next video with a new pattern till then bye take care
