so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing data types in c plus plus we have discussed intent flow data type now we'll see the next is character data type in c plus plus so in this video we'll talk about this thing all the points about character data type like how characters are stored the size of the character area type everything we will discuss with the help of a program i will show you practical also right now before that just want to ask you one thing if you guys are preparing for placements or if you guys will be preparing for placements then one subject which is really very important for interview point of view is data structure and algorithm in every interview technical round of you know in every company they ask this question from this subject data structure and algorithm so you need to practice questions on dsa and algorithms right you have to you know prepare a complete roadmap to prepare for dsa but the question is from where you can prepare from where you can practice the questions of data structure and algorithm so there is one platform geeks4geeks that you will get a lots of questions on each topic like in data structure you can say arrays stack link list or you can search more topics on each topic topic wise you will get list of questions so you can practice this thing from here for algorithm also searching algorithm sorting algorithm you will get many questions on this site but if you want to prepare specific company wise interview problems then also you will get here that thing you can select any company like amazon samsung or microsoft you can click on that and you will find out the list of questions that would be asked in the interview of those companies so company specific entry problems also you will get here you can practice those problems here and these you know problems are of good standard they have listed down all the no problems from basic to advanced level so i think it would be good resource for you guys to prepare your data structure and algorithm to practice data structure and algorithm questions so the link of this website i'll put in the description box of this video you just go to that link and you will get these questions right up according to your convenience you can select the topic or the company and you can prepare you can practice those questions so all the relevant links and details will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is cad airline so it take it takes one byte of memory means eight bits to store you see in the next last video we have discussed one video like in shortened and data modifiers are also there short long unsigned and signed so two data modifiers you can use with cash that is signed and unsigned no short and long you can use with cap right so the short end was having size two bytes and cad is taking one byte of memory so this is you can say the smallest one eight bits right so you can uh the maximum number and minimum number you can store in this is what there are eight bits in every bit you put zero zero zero so the minimum number is zero and the maximum one maximum is in all the eight bits store one one one one so that would be 255 255 is nothing but 2 raised to the power 8 minus 1 right this is for unsigned care the range and for signed care the range is minus 128 to 127 it's nothing but minus 2 raised to the power 7 2 2 raised to the power 7 minus 1 y 2 raised to the power 7 bits because 1 bit is for sine that must be whether it's negative or positive remaining seven bits are used to store the number see why we are we are the logic for getting this thing and this thing we have discussed that and when we were discussing the interior type the range of india type the same logic you have to put here and you will get the range here so this is for unsigned range unsigned care this is for signed cap now see this basically cad data type is used to store characters like abcd small abcd capital abcd and small numbers also integer value right so see when you write a program the computer can't understand high level language english language whatever in whatever language you write the program computer is not able to understand that thing that would be converted into zeros and ones binary form right and that computer can understand now if suppose we want to store something like this in a program we have int a is equal to 10 so this 10 also is integer value so that would be converted into binary with numeric system right we have a numeric system so this 10 would be 1 0 1 0 now that would be stored in computer memory right but how this character like we have a we have a we have the symbol dollar we have hash how these letters and symbols have to be stored to be converted into binary see if a compute if a number is the integer we can use numeric system and we can convert into binary but how these symbols and characters can be converted into binary these are not in this uh integer form right so for for this thing we have character system right you can google how many character systems are there there are list of character systems you will get without but the famous one is sky character system we use american standard code for information interchange sky table this is the sky table and mainly character system were introduced mainly for computer programming languages one characteristics using one character system one entire language can be converted into integer form right like you can see in sky we have capital abcd for each character we have in numeric value integer value for capital a we have 65 or small a we have 97 like this so one complete language can be converted into integer form and once you get integer number using numeric system we can convert that integer into binary form and that's how we store these characters or alphabet or you know digits or symbols into binary form using character system these are characters are stored same as integers are stored in the computer memory right these are nothing but numeric using sky uh system sky core they are converted into by you can say integer number integer form numeric form and then binary and then stored in the computer memory right let's see in sky table from 0 to 31 first 32 characters are unprintable you cannot print these things these are just commands right after 3232 is for space after 32 from 33 you get the letters the capital abcd small abcd uh the numbers 0 to 9 and some symbols as you can see in the table so how we can use this carrier type with the help of a program let me just show you first of all for that thing you have to remember these circles same here here also we have circles signed and unsigned so signed for signed care we have 0 1 2 up to 127 and minus 1 minus 2 till minus 120 8 minus 127 this value and for unsigned care we have 0 1 2 up to 255 here we have 250 4 250 3 so whenever we print when you write a program you have to you know keep in mind these circles and see this is what sky was american standard code for information interchange but it's not like that only americans are in the world there are many other languages also right other people also exist in this uh you know world so other languages are also there those languages have this special symbols those symbols are not in this sky table so for those symbols for those languages we use which table unicode table right and for unicode table to represent a character or a symbol which is in unicode table another type is used that is because in that table we have many many many characters many symbols and using character we have only eight bits so maximum we can represent up to 255 characters see if you uh do the plus of small letters 25 26 26 capital letters then 0 to 9 numbers then some those symbols then those the sum of these are less than 255 right so that's why care is sufficient to represent that language right but we have multiple languages in the world many characters are there many symbols are there russian language and many languages right so care is not sufficient to represent those those characters or symbols right so the characters are symbols that are in unicode table that would the which data type is used to represent those thing w care underscore t this is not in c this is in c plus plus so that thing also will discuss in next video this take actually two bytes means 16 bits right so using 16 bits you can see how many characters we can represent two series power sixteen minus one zero to two raise for sixteen minus one that is more than this this thing right so this thing will discuss about this data we'll discuss the next video let me just show you now one example or you can say program of cadet okay so we have created a file care underscore dt.cpp now there we have uh header io stream voltage then using name space std then in main we are declaring a cad data type cat suppose i am taking a variable name care ch equal to now whatever you will write in single code that will be considered as a character so in single quote i am suppose simply i am writing a you know this is character right and semicolon and if you don't write any data modifier before the scan then it would be considered as signed character it will take both positive value and negative value right so now let let's just print this c out and i am just printing on ch and this is for endl i am printing now what it will print simply it will print simple answer is it will print a small a because we have stored this small a right and small a is stored half converted into first of all the individual form that is 97 97 converted into binary and that would be stored in memory so this we get 9 7 here sorry a here but if you want to get that integer value of this a like a sky value then how that also you can get how you have to type cast this thing before the ch just type cast and end because we want to print the what into value right so this is typecasting don't worry we'll discuss this type casting everything in the later video in detail but just i just want to show you this thing so just have to print in bracket end that's it and it will print the integer value of this a is 97 so it will print 97 as you can see right now see if i store here 2 2 is also a character now i am suppose int you are taking and what it will print right now see it is printing 50 because 2 it is taking as a character and in sky table as you can refer in this sky table corresponding to 2 the decimal or the you can see the numeric value integer value is 50. so it is printing 50. right but if you want to print simply this character not the corresponding sky value so you no need to type classes simply print ch the name of the variable it will print 2 right so and see rather than this code mark single quotation mark if i simply store integer value 2 what it will print now it will print see what it is printing any garbage value or any symbol right because the character corresponding to this 2 in the sky table is i have told you from 0 to 31 those are unprintable characters these are just commands so it is printing anything right now if i write down here 32 or suppose if i print type cast it using this end then what it will print it will print now it is printing 2. the integer value it is printing right 2 is what integer we are not putting it into that what you can say single code right so simply integer value it is printing that is 2 now see if i print here 32 32 is for space right so what it will print it will print nothing see it is printing nothing because it is for space right and now if i store 33 so 33 for 33 what it will print exclamatory symbol it is printing you can refer to the sky table right now it is for signed it is signed care now if i print the range is from minus 128 to 127 so if i take here 128 plus 128 see what happened what it will print see it is printing this symbol for this you can refer to the extended sky table for 128 this is the symbol right and if i write here 156 and then print then what it will print this symbol it will print for 1 156 if you print the int value means type cast into int it into int so with what it will print it is not printing 120 156 it will print minus 100 y because of that circle in that circle signed circle from 0 to 127 after 127 minus 128 means 129 means minus 128 130 means minus 127 like this then minus 1 means 255 right so that is why somewhere minus 100 would be there and uh for that 156 numbering is there so 2 you can get to that circle or if you are getting confused then simply 128 let us take this example for 128 it should print minus 128 because after 127 we get 128 but for 128 in the circle we have minus 128 right so see it will print minus 128 right so you have to keep in mind that circle like in c we will we are printing using percentage uh c the character value percent is b the integer value right but here you have to type cast it like int we have done so this is how you can store the values if i take 255 here and i am not printing the into value simply what symbol is there for 1 255 it is simply the delete command so it will print nothing see it is printing nothing right and if you want to check out the limit like minimum limit and maximum limit of these so there is one header file limits dot h right you can just press ctrl and click limits dot h and see here you will get the limit see hash define character byte 8 bytes right signed care minimum minus 128 signed care maximum 127 unsigned care maximum 255 like this in limits dot h they have limit of for int also for short also over long also for long long also and see these are you can say the variables the macros hash define this thing simply in your program if you see out this thing as hrt underscore mix you will get this value you can try out this thing you can use these variables in your program also like if you want to use this s care underscore min it will give you minus 128 let me just show you one example c out s care c underscore min so it will print the limit is sorry the minimum limit is minus 128 see it is printing minus 128 right and 255 we are taking so that is for delete so it is not printing anything for this character but you have to use the same symbol so you can check out these you can you know explore these header files also what are this in this header files so if you are confused like the range of these integers short and care you can just check out the limits dot header file and there you will get the range right so i hope cad data type is clear to you guys if you have any doubt you can ask me in comment section now in the next video we will see wpair underscore c this white character the state eye so that's the next video till then bye you
