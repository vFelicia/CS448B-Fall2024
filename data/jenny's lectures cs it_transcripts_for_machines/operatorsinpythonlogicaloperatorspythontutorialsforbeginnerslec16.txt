so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing operators in Python now in the previous video we have seen arithmetic assignment and till now we have seen arithmetic assignment and comparison operators now in this video we will see logical operators okay three logical operators are there logical and and or and not three logical operators are there now these are used these are used to combine two or more conditions actually or you can say used to combine conditional statements now what does that mean whatever I am saying see if I take two variables like a is equal to 5 and a comma B is equal to 5 comma 4. okay now I want to check a condition two condition I want to check a should be greater than 4 and B should be less than 10. these two condition I want to check so what I will say like in English I am saying generally I'm saying a should be greater than 4 and B should be less than 10. so how you can write down this thing these two conditions in the same line when you are using that thing you are in programming how you can write down this thing same you can use you know and operators only because we have an operator in Python logical and which will do the same thing that whatever we want so in between these you can check you can write down add so it will check a greater than 4 and B less than 10 then only it will give if you print then only it will print true okay otherwise false fine I hope you got this here we are not using these like in C and C plus plus b this is what logical and no we simply write and right now see here a greater than 4 a is 5 yes true and B less than 10 B is 4 yes it is true both are true so it will give you if I write down something like this print a greater than 4 and B Less Than 3 in this case a greater than 4 yes because is 5 and in B we have 4. be less than 3 no this condition is not true so this is true this is false if one is true one is false then and operator will give false do you remember truth table of this and if you have read that Boolean algebra if not let me just tell you the truth table of this and if see this is truth table of and one is true if both are true it will give you true one is true one is false it will give false this is false this is true then only it give false if both are false then also it will give false so and operator will give true if what the conditions are true okay so this and this both are true then only it will give true if any one of this is false it will give false this is directable of hand now logical or operator okay if I write here or means we want either this or this condition should be true not both this or this a greater than 4 a is 5 is true so if one is true ultimately it will give you true here also I am writing or a greater than 4 suppose here I am writing a less than 4. a less than 4 no a is 5 this is false this condition is false or B Less Than 3 this is also false so it will give false if I write B less than 13. now this is false but this is true B is less than 13 yes so 1 is true one is false then it will give 3. for the output to be true only one condition must be true in case of or so what is truth table of this or basically this is for and this truth table is for and and for logical or if both are true it will give to you if this is true this is false then also it will give true if this is false this is true true if this is false this is false false so C if any one is true then it will give to you it will give False only if both the conditions are false so this is truth table for logical or okay I hope you got from this thing now one is logical not it will reverse the result means suppose we are writing suppose something like this if I print print not a see here a is 5 5 means other than 0 anything would be considered as true okay so a is true not a it will give false so it will reverse the result if I write a is equal to force and if I print print note a so a is false not a means it will reverse it reverse of false is true so it will give true simply logical not means it will reverse it is going to reverse the result okay very simple now let me just show you this thing on my laptop practically we will see how to use this logical and over and not operators so let's see logical operators these were assignment operators and same we are taking suppose a b 4 and 3. okay if simply I write print so this is the condition you want to check like a less than equal to 3 less than three and b equal to 3. and we are writing logical and operator right so is a Less Than 3 a is 4 no condition is not true it is false so if anyone is false rather than checking the another condition what if anyone is false the ND will give false so ultimately it will result it will not check the second condition it will result False only okay because we know in and case the first is false so if second one is true then also it will give false if second one is false then also it will go false so no need to check the second one okay now rather than n if we write or now a Less Than 3 this is false but in this case still it will take the second condition because in or if anyone is true it will give true so we have to check both the condition and b equal to equal to 3 yes it is true so now it will give you true see it will give you true okay and if I write not a note a means it will give you what false because a is 4 that is true it will give fourths okay so rather than either something like this you can write C is equal to like true but see T should be capital and in false F should be Capital otherwise it will give error now if I write node C so it will give you what false okay and if we write something like this a less than equal to 4 and C so a less than equal to 4 less than equal to Fourier says 4 so that is true c c is true so both are true in that case it will give you true okay now if I write a less than 4 no that is false so it will give you false rather than and if I write or now it will give you true because C is true so always it will give true I hope you got the working of logical and logical or logical not operator because I have discussed the truth table of and or and not okay so you can try out different different conditions and think you can check out fine so these are logical operators so I hope you go to what are logical operators and how to use these operators right and truth table of these and logical and or naught operators for not it's not like for not logical uh for not logical not operators with stable is if it is true it will give false if here we have false it will give to you it is going to negate the result okay reverse the result that's it so now in the next video we'll see bitwise operators so now we'll see in the next video till then bye bye take care
