in the series of learning programming in c I'm going to start a new Concept in C that is arrays in C right we'll discuss everything about array first of all what is need of array what is array the proper definition Declaration of array types of array initialization of array different type of operations uh that you can perform on arrays in C right but all the things I'm going to discuss in detail with minute details so that would be in separate videos in this video I'm going to tell you the basics like what is need of array right why why you use array in C and array in any programming language not in C C C++ and any programming language Java or python anything right what is Nero then we will see proper definition of array and then we will see what declaration of array right and first of all I'll uh I'll know teach you on this whiteboard the logic I'll tell you whatever thing the theory part and and then I'll show you this concept means practical of arrays how arrays can be declared what error you will get if you do this type of Declaration on my laptop right so one thing you need to take care you have to get ready with your laptop first of all if you are you want to loar C programming it's not like that just watch the lecture and that's it you got the concept no you have to be get ready with your laptop with any ID installed in my laptop I have vs code editor so I'll show you there if you don't have please install that thing or any other ID in which you are comfortable right but you have to practice the concept on the same day if you're watching this lecture right now you got this concept arrays you have to practice after this lecture on your laptop if really you want to learn C programming right and that is the biggest mistake every beginner do simple concept it's silly thing no need to practice we will jump direct to the complex concept right a complicated concept that is the biggest mistake even even the concept is very small very simple you have to practice that thing also right so now back to the topic first of all we'll discuss why arrays need of arrays in any programming language here I'm discussing arrays in the context of C programming right I hope everybody is aware about the fundamental data types int float care right now see if I write something like this if you want to store a number if you want to process any number if you want to store in that memory in the computer memory what you need to do you have to declare a variable means you have to you know take a variable and there only we can store what any number you want to store right like int a this is what declaration of a variable of type integer right now here it means what compiler will do what some memory allocation would be Memory would be allocated to this a right a is what name of variable data type is integer now memory is what it's something like this so memory is what these are what bites this is one b one b one bite so this is what memory it's type like a long tape of you can say these are bytes so now in this memory what how many bites would be allocated to this a size of integer is what it depends basically on machine to machine right somewhere it takes two bytes or somewhere in some compiler it takes four bytes whatever I'm using it is it is taking what four bites so we cannot say uh you know directly that in inte will take two byes or integer will take four bytes it can take two also four also it depends on your machine right here I'm taking that is why integer will take what four bites so four bytes would be allocated to this a like suppose from any address address is what suppose this is 1,000 address is what in the form of hexadecimal form but for Simplicity purpose I'm taking just th000 so this is what th000 this is what 1,1 1,2,3 something like this and suppose these four bytes has been allocated to this a 1 2 3 4 four bytes for integer or you will take two bytes right now whatever number if you initialize if you want to store five like I'm initializing five so here this five would be stored first of all it would be converted into binary then it would be stored here right so now for Simplicity purpose I'm not taking these bytes I'm converting it something like this just one box the name of this memory location is a here we have stored five and the address of this is what 1,000 these four bytes Base address is 1,000 so we will see we'll take what address is what th000 right now see if you want to store here another number six I want to store what you will do here six so this five would be overwritten means five is no more now and we have stored six now we want to store seven so now six is no more we have stored seven if it means what I hope you getting my point you can store only one number right if you want to store another number the previous number has gone right but practically you you want to process you have to process large amount of data if suppose I want to in my class I have 60 students so now I want to store R numbers of 60 students now how I can store one way is what I can declare what a b c like int a int B and c and 60 variables you can declare in and in one variable I can store RO number one RO number two RO number three like this obviously this is silly thing no need I mean nobody wants this kind of thing if you do this kind of thing your program will be what filled with uh declaration and this initialization of variables only we don't want this kind of thing right so that is why what I want can we do something like this under one variable name only I can store 60 numbers yes that is possible with the help of arrays now that is called arrays right under one variable name I can store more than one data item this is what suppose considering it as a number or a data item so here in Array we can store more than one data item right but it is not the complete definition complete definition I'll tell you step by step right so now if suppose I want to store R number of six students of my class then and type obviously you have to tell the compiler the type based on that only you have the compiler will allocate you space the in memory man in memory memory manager will allocate you space so suppose R number are obviously of integer type I'm taking what name of here names I'm taking a only and now you have to tell the size means how many number you want to store 60 right in these brackets size is 60 so this is what array now here data type A is what name of array if you want to take any name any a b c or anything you can take better to take a meaningful name suppose I want to store R number so better to take here what name what R number so I'm taking here what int R number and size is 60 so name of my array is R number size is 60 and data type is integer so this is what declaration of array this is how you declare an array right so now how many bytes would be allocated to this when this would be compiled then how many bytes would be allocated integer will take four bytes into how many number you want to store how many item 60 so how many bytes would be allocated 240 bytes would be allocated here right and how these 240 bytes would be allocated in consecutive memory locations continous it's not like that here allocated four bytes then leaves uh leave some space then 10 bytes then leave some space then uh in another place 20 bytes something like this no these 240 by should be located in consecutive uh memory locations like from 1,000 it is going to start suppose from 1,000 it is going to start till how many bytes 1,000 and 240 then how many bytes till 1 12 4 0 the address would be 1 12 4 0 till then continuous the memory locations would be allocated to this and now you can store here 60 numbers right so now I hope need is clear to you why array what is need of array now what is array here just I'm taking a simple array in a and size is only five I'm taking right so now the Declaration is also clear to you how to declare array General syntax if you write then what you will write here data type then what name of array and then in this bracket what size of aray and semicolon this is what general syntax to declare array this is 1D array 2D array is also there multidimensional arrays also there 1D array means here we have only one row and multiple columns right now see the proper definition of array see here one one point you know it is what collection of more than one data item right but second point is what the condition here is what or you can say the const here is what all the data items should be of same type like suppose this is what integer the name of I mean the data type of the are is what integer so all the five numbers must be of integer type right it's not like that you can store two integer type two character and one float no all should be of integer type like I can store here five number 1 2 3 4 4 5 or maybe 10 20 0 1 0 these are of integer type this is correct this is correct but if you want to store here 10 20 and uh 1.2 and uh 0 and 2.2 this is not correct these are what integer but this is what float so this is wrong so the condition is what you can store more than one data item but all the data items should be of same type this is the condition right or you can say that homogeneous data item collection of array is what collection of homogeneous data items and array can be of any type like here this is what I'm taking integer integer type of array you can also take float or B and size is 10 here all the 10 dat item should be of float type you can also take character array c c 10 here all the data items the 10 data items you want to Sol in this ARR should be of character type so now you what you can say array is what collection of homogeneous data items which are stored in how contigous memory locations I'll also discuss memory representation of array 1D array 2D array also multidimensional array in a separate video right when when once we have complete all the concepts of arrays everything about arrays then you can form a complete proper definition right but here in this for this video just uh you have to uh you know remember what collection of data items which are of same type or collection of homogeneous data items which are stored in contigous memory locations right now I guess need is clear and what is array is clear now Declaration of array declaration is also clear clear this is the general syntax right but now see here you have to take care you have to take care some points something like this if I write here something like this I'm not specifying the size but when you will write this line and here semicolon it will give error the compiler will give error you have to specify the size one thing you need to take care second thing what you need to take care about declaration here you can only specify what any constant like 5 10 15 anything constant but here you cannot write minus like Min 5 this would be incorrect so you can say what more specifically you can say this should be a positive number positive constant or if you say more specifically then what you can say this is also correct if you declare something like this in a 2 + 2 is this correct yes this is correct 2 + 2 is equivalent to 4 and four is what positive constant okay fine this is also fine in a 3 into 2 3 into 2 is 6 6 is also constant this is also fine you can declare something like this and what you can declare you can also declare something like this int a and here you can write 10 by 2 this is also fine right that would be five right and if you write something like this 11 by 2 that is also five now so this is what you can say it's a uh expression also so one thing you need to take care the size of are should be a positive expression can be positive regular expression right this this is what expression only because here we are writing oper and prer so this is what expression this is right this is right this is also right this is incorrect blank is also incorrect right and if you write something like this int suppose I'm writing a and u here another variable B is equal 11 by 2 this would also give error right or you have to tell me you have to try this and you have to tell me is it correct or not you can also declare before this line int B because I'm taking another variable B int B and in a a is equal to in bracket you will say B is equal to any expression 11 by2 so you have to tell me this will give error or this is correct and this is what 1D array because here we have only when you declare something like this I'm taking this example then what five 1 2 3 4 five this name of this array is what a right and here we can store five numbers so this is what four bytes this is what four bytes how many bytes total have been allocated to this array 4 into 5 that is 20 bines suppose address is started from 1,000 then this address would be what next element address of next element would be 104 four bytes for one integer then 8 then 12 then 1,6 this is how in contigous memory location 20 byes should be allocated to this are and one more thing in uh this declaration see you cannot write something like this int a and size is n suppose you are taking in int n and you are writing here the variable no this should be what a constant so this is what incorrect right you have to try it at your own but you can use macros in that case you can write here what that whatever macro name you take how macros see I hope you are aware about macros uh before main function we declare what hash Define macro name is I'm taking n and size I'm taking five here we will write what header files and then in main function what I'm declaring array in a and here I can take size what the name of the macro is n this is correct that would be replaced with this five this is what macro and it's better to when you use array it's better to use macros to Define to the size of the array why it is better to use macros that I'll show you in next video right so that that is correct but this is what not correct so everything the Practical we will see in next video only I think that's it for this video in the next video I'll I'll tell you what uh initialization of arrays right and I'll show you this this macro is this correct or not and why it is better to use macros when we are you know dealing with array right on my laptop I'll show you in the next video but for this video that's it and you have to practice at your own you have to try all is declaration whether these are correct or not maybe I'm wrong whether these are you know giving error or not one more thing you have to try what int a and the size is zero is this correct or not this declar declaration correct or not right so you have to tell me in com comment box for this and this you have to try these for your own right I'll show you on my laptop in next video right so now I think that's it for this video I hope you are clear with the need of array why array uh definition of array not proper definition we have discussed because uh all the properties we are discussing one by one in all the videos but that whatever we have discussed in this video that you I think you are cleared with that thing and the Declaration of array and different different types of Declaration how you can declare array right so I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
