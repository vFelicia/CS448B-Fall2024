so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing control structures in c plus plus basically three type of control structure sequential selection and iteration right or you can say repetition fine sequential means nothing but a simple program you are writing and one by one in sequence all the statements are going to be executed simple program selection means you have some choices and based on some condition you have to select from those choices those are selection statements like if if else else if letter switch case statements these we have discussed now next is iteration or you can say repetition repetitive statements those are loops iterations means or repetition means you are repeating same task again and again that is repetition so those things we can achieve we can implement in programming with the help of loops right so what are those loops that thing we are going to start from this video so in this video we will be discussing some introduction to loops basics like what is loop and why you need loops that thing is very important why you need loops right and what are loops what are you know basic categories of loops two basic categories right and basic scenarios how you know loops is to be executed some important points general points basic points about loops we'll be discussing in this video then in later videos one by one we'll be discussing types of loops right so we'll be discussing that thing here with the help of real life example as well as with help of a program right now before i just want to tell you one thing on geeks4geeks there is an event going on uh known as interview series in this uh series in this event every sunday seven pm seven pm they conduct a contest you can participate in this contest every sunday to prepare for your coding interview rounds for top tech companies and the next contest will be on 28th of august and what is the pattern of the contest three questions you will get a time limit would be 90 minutes and marks it is of 100 marks and after the contest you will get editorial video means a solution video where you can you know see the solutions also of those three questions that was in that contest and the language supported for this contest is c plus plus java and python and plus there is five percent penalty for each row submission so before uh submission please compile and test again against the sample test cases and then only submit your answer right and you will get two week bits for participating in this contest and you can also you know redeem these uh bits on that reward page so all the relevant links and details you will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what are loops and why we need loops see uh real life example is whenever you play any song so there are some you know options for you guys like one in that corner something like this in loop means shuffle in loop these kind of things means the same song would be played again and again that same song would be repeated that is in loop right so if you are doing same task again and again that is you can say you are in loop or that is you means you are repeating the same task again and again means suppose uh you want to print simple example you have taken like you have print hello world on the screen so what you have written c out simply hello world that's it obviously header files and all you have to write down main function and all but the main thing is you have to write this thing c out output and this is what you can say for outputting something on the screen in c plus we use c out this object hello world now on the output screen one time hello world would be printed now i would say i want to print two times hello world simple what you will do see out one more time you will write hello world although it would be the same line if you want to do in a different line you can just put a slash new line operator or you can just put handle manipulator at the end here right two times it will be print now i i want to ask you to print hello world five time on the screen means you will say means you can write down this line five time in your program but if i say print this hello world thousand times can you write thousand times this line in your program is it a good idea no way so is it possible that we write only once this line in your in our program and we are able to print thousand times hello world on the output screen yes it is possible with the help of loops you can use loops and the same time sorry the this one line you can write down this line in loop right okay there are multiple loops the syntax is also different i am not going to discuss the syntax of each loop here simple just write down loop syntax here how to write down loop that also will be discussing one by one simply write down that loop syntax whatever loop you are using and in that loop one line you can write down that's it no need to write down this line again and again and if you want to print five times that is also possible if you want to print thousand times suppose i want to print hundred times so in loop you have to tell obviously we have to tell how many times you want to print when to terminate 100 times right if i want to print 100 times this so i have to tell this with the help of that program i have to tell the compiler like let's start from 1 and till 100 print as soon as 100 times this has printed stop so mainly you have to tell from where to start from one suppose you are starting from where to start the like you can say initialization of loop second thing where to end where to terminate means termination condition right two things and then third thing is what like one then two obviously there is someone who is counting suppose i am counting one time i have printed then second time third fourth fifth but obviously manually we are not counting there on the screen we have to put something automatically that would be incremented like one two three four five whenever it reaches to ten sorry hundred stop so some update type of thing we have to give maybe through a variable or something like this right so three basic things in loop whenever you write down the loop syntax three basic basic things are there one is initialization second is condition or you can say termination condition and third thing is uh update update like increment or decrement obviously updating like one two three four five this kind of thing three basic things are there right so means when we use loops or why we need loops in which situation if you want to execute a statement or set of statements in this case we are executing only one statement but there can be set of statements multiple statements like in loop you can write one two three four five as many statement as i as i want so if you want to execute a statement or a group of statement multiple times then we use loops i hope you got the idea right and what are the benefits of using loop if you want to print 100 times hello world one way is 100 times you have to write down this line one way is using loop you can do which one is better it is time saving as well as space saving there would be less lines of code if you use loops rather than the first approach right so these are some you can say benefits of using loops right it will save your time space will be saved lines of code would be less program would be more readable maintainable rather than writing this line 100 times obviously one time if we write then that program would be more readable if i have written a program any other is you know looking at my program yours you can easily understand it more maintainable more readable program would be there you can say a good looking program is there if you use loops if you don't use loop and the first approach will follow that would be you know it's kind of a bad practice of writing programs right that is why we use loops and when we use when you want to execute a statement or group of statement multiple times then we use loops right and three basic things are there in every loop initialization condition you have to tell where to stop from where to start and update right like if your mom say like go to supermarket and buy oranges then you come to home then again your mom say go to supermarket and buy apple again you will go and come to home after buying apple then again your mom will say like go and buy bread same task bread then butter then some vegetable like ladyfinger or bitter gourd these kind of things right means you are again and again going to supermarket for one item then come back for second item you go to supermarket then come back you are in blue right second approach is you just ask your mom to list them all the items in a list like one oranges then apples these kind of things suppose 15 items are there you take this list go to supermarket then just check first buy your oranges then second apple then third fourth fifth is six whenever you reach to fifteenth item you buy that item stop that is termination condition go to billing counter and come to home right that is a good idea right so obviously from where to start you have to start like first thing is written orange is like first one you have to start from where this is initialization you where you will end when you will stop buying when you have reached to the last item in your list you have bought the last item in your list then you are going to stop right and one thing obviously you update means you are you are in this case you are manually checking you are the updater only like this thing okay second third fourth fifth this kind of thing in programming obviously we are not manually we cannot update we cannot check for second therefore like like this so you have to take some variable you have to update that variable right how to write down this thing properly in syntax that also will be discussing but i hope the general idea is clear to you guys right about loops now mainly loops are categorized into you can say two categories entry controlled loop and exit control loop now entry controlled loop means what see whenever you go to any you can say whenever you go to metro then before boarding a metro you are being checked right your luggage and you if you are okay you don't have any suspicious item you are ready to go that is you can say entry control that entry on entry also they are checking they have some condition like you cannot uh board a metro with the knife right so if you have a knife this is some conditions are there some items are restricted so if those items are available in your bag or with you you are not allowed to enter that is the condition right that is entry controlled thing at entry also at entry only they are checking you exit control means suppose uh there is supermarket more supermarket near my house so whenever i have to buy some vegetable foods i go to there at entry they are not going to check but at exit they check the bill and the items i about if both are matching it's okay both are not matching some required action would be taken so that kind of thing is exit controlled at exit condition is being checked so in loops same two things entry control loops i hope you can relate this thing entry control that exit control now if you have understood understood this two things you can just let me know in comment section some real life example of entry controlled and exit control other than whatever i have given to you two examples right now entry control means first condition would be checked in a program like this is the condition if condition is true then only you can enter into the body of the loop if condition is false then out of the loop like in metro you have some suspicious you cannot enter into the metro right or maybe they'll take that thing from you guys like one time in my bag there was a knife so i was not allowed to enter so i put my knife out there then i boarded the metro okay apart from that this this is entry control now body of the loop now some update expression would be there and again condition would be checked again body of the loop if that is true in false exit from the loop this is type of entry control exit control means at first you will enter into the body of loop at first only you will not check the condition like i go to supermarket i enter into supermarket without any checking right whenever you after body of the loop then condition would be checked now if condition is true then again some update obviously update kind of thing is there update expression would be there and then again body of the loop if condition is false out of the loop right this is you can say exit controlled loop flow chart of exit control this is entry control i hope you can clearly see the difference between these two right now basically we have four loops like four while do while one more is in c plus plus we have range for loop range based you can say range based for loop this is something like for each loop in other programming language like in javasci i think we have sorry for each loop so exactly same as that thing but heavy known as it is known as range based for loop for loop range based for loop while loop two while loop right so these loops will be discussing one by one in later videos now so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
