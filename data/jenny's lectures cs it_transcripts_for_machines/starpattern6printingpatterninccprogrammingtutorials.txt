in the series of learning programming see we are discussing printing pattern programs and see in this video i will talk about how to print this pattern inverted full pyramid in the previous video i have discussed how to print full parameter that was not inverted right so first of all please check that that video then you will get it better right i'll show you the logic on the first on this whiteboard we'll discuss we'll try it in that program here then i'll show the output on my laptop using vs code editor so now first of all whenever you see the pattern you have to analyze it and you have to divide it into like rows and columns then you will get it better right so i'm dividing dividing it into rows and columns see here we have five rows one two three four five so one would be responsible to handle these rows one is for this is what leading space and this space is what trailing space after the start trailing space before the star leading space right so in the first row there is no space so zero space here we have one space here we have two space here we have three and here we have four space before the star right so now first would be j outer loop we generally take the variable what i sorry not j i that is i would be responsible that would be responsible for these rows and jth would be responsible for the columns how many columns are there right so basically three loops would be required the outer loop would be in every pattern the outer loop would be responsible for the number of lines or the number of rows here right that is is loop one would be responsible to print these spaces and third loop would be responsible to print these stars right so now how we will print these thing see if i take i and space like how to analyze how to find out the condition right because in first in this row only one space before the star here we have two space here three space here four space so what should be the condition how many times in every row space should be printed how many times star should be printed what should be the condition right so now here see rather than taking i from 1 to 5 here i am taking i from 5 to 1 why i am saying this let me just clear out that thing also it's not like that there is only one way to print this pattern i'm just discussing this way only there can be multiple ways also maybe loop outer loop would be from one to five and then in the inner loop you can change the condition and you can print this pattern but i am just changing the outer loop here from five to one why so see for the first row i value is 5 and there is no space no leading space for second i value is 4 then 3 then 2 then 1 space would be 0 then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 right now how to find out the relation the condition to print the space see the same condition in the previous video also we have discussed number of rows minus i if i write number of rows minus i for space here total number of rows are five for the first line five minus i value is five not one it's five we are taking in decreasing one five minus five zero for second five minus four one for third five minus three two four fourth five minus two three five minus uh for this one five minus one that is four yes exactly we are getting it so this should be the condition for printing the space right for printing the star what should be the condition first of all let me write down this thing if we are not taking like the the the fixed value of i fixed value of number of rows like if you want the user should enter number of rows you or she want to print then what you can do you can just take a variable rows and you can ask from the user at the run time using printf and scanf right i hope you know how to take input at runtime i am taking the variable name rows i am not writing here the complete program i will discuss the complete program on my laptop right now outer loop would be i should be till number from number of rows see i is from 5 to 1 but here i am not taking 5 here i am taking a variable rows so i would be initialized with rows whatever the value of rows 5 10 7 20 i should be greater than equal to till 1 whenever i value becomes 0 stop it so i should be greater than equal to 1 and i minus minus h not plus plus right so now inner loop one loop would be responsible to print space so now space would be space would be initialized with one we have already found out the condition for space for printing space space is less than equal to rows minus i right and here we do not have space so i am writing here space plus plus and within this loop just print space right now one loop would be to print these stars now find out the condition to print star see in the first row we have nine stamps then seven then five then three then one the condition you can only find out using the three or four variables you have i j total number of rows space this thing only so you have to do with these variables only some multiplication division minus plus anything you can do to find out the condition right so better to print better to you know first of all you know write down this kind of table so that you can analyze what pattern is or what relation is there with these i space or j or star see here if i do 5 into 2 10 but here we have star 9 here we have 2 into i that is 8 but here we have 7 so what you can do 2 into i minus 1 to print the stars for the first row i value is 5 that is 10 minus 1 9 okay for second 2 minus 4 minus 2 into 4 8 minus 1 7 okay for third 2 into 3 6 minus 1 5 okay 4 minus 1 3 2 minus 1 1 yes and we got the condition to print star 2 into y minus 1 right so this one j should be from 1 j less than equal to 2 into i minus 1 and j plus plus and within this simply print star and in the outer loop we have to print one more thing that is slash and that's it now let me dry run this see first of all it will ask enter number of rows and suppose one variable is rows and i'm entering total number of rows five so now first of all i would be initialized with rows so i is equal to five is five greater than equal to one yes condition tree we will enter here now space would be initialized with one now one less than equal to rows minus i total number of rows 5 minus i is also 5 5 minus 5 0 is this condition true 1 less than equal to 0 no will not enter into this loop exit from the loop and one more loop is there that is j is equal to one means no space would be printed and that's exactly what you want because in first line there is no space zero space we have right j one j less than equal to two into i minus one n minus 1 that is 9 because i value is 5 yes condition tree we will enter here and star would be printed right now again j plus plus that is 2 2 less than equal to 9 yes means again star will be printed so how many times the slope would be run 9 times when j value becomes 10 then it becomes false so means 9 star will be printed here now when j value becomes finally 10 condition not to exit from the loop and slash and now cursor would be next line now i minus minus now i becomes 4 is 4 greater than equal to one yes condition tree we will enter into this loop space would be again initialized with one now one less than equal to now see rows minus one total number of rows five minus sorry i rose minus i five minus i value is 4 that is 5 minus 4 that is 1 now condition trim now we will enter into here into this and space would be printed one space below this first star right space plus plus that is 2 2 less than equal to 1 condition to you know now we will not enter here means no space would be printed and that's exactly we want only one space in second line now out from this loop and now j would be again initialized with 1 now 1 less than equal to c 2 into i minus 1 now i value is 4 2 into 4 8 minus 1 that is 7. is this condition true yes you will enter here and star would be printed so how many times this 2 would be executed 7 times whenever j value becomes 8 then it is going to stop so now means 7 star would be printed here and that's exactly we want 7 star right when i value j value becomes 8 exit from the loop and slash and means next line now i minus minus i becomes three now i hope you can you got it you can draw iron by yourself right now let me show you the output of this into my laptop on my laptop now let me create one more file that is pattern 9 dot c right and we have already discussed in the previous video how to print the pyramid this is just the inverted pyramid so we don't have to you know change much so i'm just copying the previous code here if you haven't watched my previous video please check it out first then come to this video right so i'm just copying the previous code here the only uh difference here is what just have to change the this one uh that outer loop for the number of lines i would be initialized with rows it should be in decreasing order right and i should be greater than equal to 1 here i minus minus right space lu would be same the condition would be rows minus i and for the printing the star we have same condition that is 2 into i minus 1 right now just let me just run this now say it is asking enter number of rows let me enter 5 and see the pattern now let me just run this for 10 number of rows 10 and see this is inverted full pyramid right so i hope you would have to print this pattern so i hope you got how to print this pattern now i'll see in the next video with a new pattern till then bye take care
