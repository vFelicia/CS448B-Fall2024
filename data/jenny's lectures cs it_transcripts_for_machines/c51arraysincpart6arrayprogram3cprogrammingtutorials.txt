and the series of learning programming in cv are discussing some programs on arrays we have discussed two programs in this video i'll discuss one more program and that is you have to read array of 10 in teaser and then we will count total number of owed numbers and total number of even numbers in that area then we'll print right so now i guess how to read an integer that is fine you are i guess aware with that thing because we have discussed in previous two videos that thing just using a for loop and scan a function so i'm going to start from the main function directly first of all i'll show you here the logic will discuss the logic here one by one step by step then i'll show you the output on my laptop right so now any of 10 integers suppose any error name you can take in the previous video i have taken name what marks better to take meaningful name because there you are taking marks of students so better to take any marks here it's not like anything we can take because we are going to read only 10 integers so a i'm taking a of 10 right now we have to count total number of even and like even suppose we have entered five even in fifo so you have to print five even is equal to five elements even even elements are five four elements are five so there you have to store those numbers so two variable you have to take even and o variable name you can take any variable m b or c but better meaningful name like even to store even number of data the count of even numbers and code to store count of four numbers right you will initially initialize with these variables with zero also why that will i'll discuss here only then we will initialize these so now first of all just read value from 0 to 10 using a for loop and scan a function i guess you are aware about about this thing that's it right now till this working of this for loop is what we have when the compiler will compile these lines then first of all what area of a size is what area of what one two sorry zero one 3 4 5 6 7 8 index would be from 0 to size minus 1 that is 9 and suppose we have entered some values like this 1 2 4 7 10 15 16. these values i have entered using this for loop i hope no need to explain the working of this for loop everybody know i have discussed many times this working and address is suppose for the first base address is what 100 so in a what 100 would be store and this is what you can say a pointer to this first element of the array it is known as what internal pointer variable so i guess address you can all these variables you can calculate integer i am taking four bytes so next address would be one zero four now how to count number of odd and even for that for counting we will have to access these elements right for accessing take what one more for loop that would be from 0 to same 10 and i plus plus now here see access first element if it is owed what we'll do code plus plus means we will increment value if it is even increment even this even value even plus plus like house same x a second element if even then even plus plus add one more in even or if it is old add one more in code if else you have to use right simple logic is there now the this logic for calculating odd and even is what if the number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0 then even number otherwise old number so you have to check the remainder so directly use here if else if how to access this thing just add a name and index index we are taking what i that will be from iterate from 0 to 10 if it is here i am taking modulo modulo 2 equal to equal to 0 we are checking remainder i guess you know the working of mode operator i have discussed this working of all the operators in my previous videos in c you can check out so to check remainder we will use this modulo operator right if this mod 2 equal to equal to 0 means it is even number so what we can do even is equal to even plus one or you can do even plus plus also that is also fine right else the number would be old so else no need to write down any condition you can do what ode is equal to ode plus 1 or you can write code plus plus that is same thing rather than this you can write 4 plus plus rather than this you can write even plus plus right so now see even plus 1 that is why we have to initialize even with 1 because if you not initialize this even an odd variable here it is going to take what any garbage value in c and in garbage value we will add one it will give you any garbage value you will not give the correct result so that is why before using these kind of things such kind of things we have to initialize these things first of all and also zero right now you can simply print what even and odd so this is how you can print even elements are percentage d the variable i'm taking what even and this is for old so let me show you the working of this thing i have just entered this array now this for loop one variable is i first of all i would be zero and two more variables here even and whole so before using this i will have to declare this also right don't forget this thing so this is what even having 0 and this is old variable having 0 address of these are something maybe this is 1000 and 2046 and 3000 something like this right so now i zero yes condition true enter here now if a of i a of i a 5 is 0 a5 is what 1 so 1 mode 2 one more to if you divide 1 by 2 remainder would be one only like this we divide one this two then here would be zero because we cannot divide and remainder would be one only so obviously we are taking the remainder right so that is 1 so 1 equal to 0 no condition is not true so we will not enter here we will go over in else 1 else block in else we have code plus 1 od is a zero zero plus one is one and that would be assigned to this code now code value becomes one and obviously this one is what old number right now i plus plus now y becomes one condition 2 yes again enter here a of 1 now now a of 1 a of 1 is 2 how to access using that formula x is first of all calculate the address and then we are going to access now 2 2 more 2 if you will divide 2 by 2 then remainder would be 0 condition true yes now even plus 1 so now even becomes 1 right now again i plus plus i becomes 2 this one we are going to access this one 4 4 mode 2 yes it is also 0 so again even plus 1 even was 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 now 2 would be assigned to this event right i plus plus i becomes 3 now condition again 2 yes enter here a of 3 a of 3 is 7 7 mode 2. is it 0 no it would be 1. so now not in if block we will go to else broken ode plus 1 ode is 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 and that would be assigned to this one right now i is 4 i guess now you can uh no need to explain the working more now till this thing we have got 2 even number and 2 odd number yeah that is fine to even into all and once you will go here i is equal to 10 then we are going to exit till then you will go you will get how many odd and even numbers right here after that condition not true once i becomes 10 and exit from this for loop and print even elements we will we are going to fetch from this variable and all the elements just print out and we are going to fetch from this one so it is going to print how many code numbers and how many even elements are there second way is here rather than using these two for loops you can use only one form that is another way right after this scanf rather than writing this for loop i am commenting this out right this is what comment right directly after this scanf directly write if blog if else and that's it now in that case what will happen see working of this one first of all in thai i would be first of all zero condition true yes enter here scanf means we are going to take input address of a phi address of a of 0 means this 100 and we are going to store value here suppose i have entered 1 right so i have stored 1 here right now rather than taking next variable what after scanf in this for loop we have what if block so directly access the first element whatever you have entered a of i i is 0 so a of 0 a of 0 is 1 if one mode 2 equal to equal to 0 not condition is not true we are we are going to enter into else block now code becomes 1 at starting both even and or zero so now what becomes one zero plus one one and one would be incremented here now i plus plus i becomes one condition true yes enter here again read input from the user address of a of one here the value would be stored like two and after storing this value just check it out if it is even a row in the previous case we have taken all the 10 elements first and then we are going to check but this also this case is also fine one you can take and at the same time you can check if it is even do even plus one if it is old do or plus one so better to use one phone right so now let me show you the output on my screen now so let me create one more files i'm taking name count suppose what even ode don't see right same include will include header file right and then main function and here any array we will take end of 10 integer right and we one variable that is i and yeah obviously even a node we have to take one even variable right and one code we are going to store the count here right equal to zero that should be here comma okay two variables we have taken now we are going to print first of all what enter array elements okay and how to enter using for loop and scanner i less than 10 and i plus plus scanf okay percentage d format specifier should be percentage g and what address of name of array is a of i name is a right and in one for loop only we are going to calculate so after entering the number here only just after entering the one number we will ah test it is even road so i'm going to use one for loop only if this number a of i whatever you have entered equal to equal to zero sorry number mode 2 equal to equal to 0 so it is what even number so we will do even plus plus or you can say 1 equal to 5 plus 1 else obviously it should be odd number so we'll do what old plus plus and i guess that's it for this for loop and after the for loop we will print total even number are how many using percentage d and the variable is even i'm going to store what in even the total number of even numbers and for ode slash n and total number of or you can say total ode number r percentage d and just print or semicolon i hope it will work let me save it and just run it so it is asking enter array elements 2 4 i'm entering all the even number like 6 8 10 4 6 8 2 and 10. see total even number now this number are 0 okay let me just run this again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 56 so even number 5 and 4 also 5 so i guess 1 2 three four and five yeah five even and five four so i hope you got it how to print even node number so in the next video we will see one more program like we will enter two arrays and then we will store some of those two edits l arrays elements by elements in third array i hope you are getting my point if not then it's okay we are going to discuss this thing in next video right or if you want me to make any other program specifically on aries you can tell me in the comment box so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
