so in the series of running Python programming language in the previous video we have seen uh conditional statements like what is if what is if else statement and how to use them the syntax and all now based on that we will do one coding exercise now you have to find out that that is very simple one the given number is even a road number even number means that is divided by 2 and with no remainder completely divisible by 2 like 2 is even number 34 is even number like this right so using input function you need to take input and then you have to check based on some condition and all right and I hope you remember when operator module operator that will give remainder in arithmetic operator when we were discussing we have discussed this thing right what is modulo operator you have to use this thing because it will give remainder and obviously you need to check remainder if the number is divided by 2 and there is no remainder then that is an even number so let this now pause the video and try out this program so let's create a new file here and we'll be writing what coding underscore excess size 6 dot p y okay let's take a number you have to check number is even a road right number and while entering I'll convert that into int input enter a number right now we have a number so put some condition if this number mode 2 equal to equal to 0. colon print obviously this this is what this is even number right else colon what we will print this is our number right so you can put this thing in single coat also actually I am from that C plus plus your Java background that is why I put double quotes but you can use single code where that is also fine now and you can put this condition in bracket also that is also fine without bracket also all fine now let's run this so obviously if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder right that is even number and remainder which operator will give us remainder module operator it will give remainder so if remainder is 0 then this is even number otherwise it is our number let's run this and enter a number 34. obviously 34 is even number so this is even number let me just run this again 33 this is odd number because there would be a reminder remember there is one so this is our number so this is simple you know how to use if else whatever we have discussed in previous video that thing you have to put in as a in the form of program right so I hope you have done this coding exercise in the next video we'll see some more conditional statements so now it's in the next video till then bye take
