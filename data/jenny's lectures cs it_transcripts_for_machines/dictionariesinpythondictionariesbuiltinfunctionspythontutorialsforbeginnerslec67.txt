hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning path and programming language in the previous video we have done one project Caesar Cipher right so now in this video what we will discuss what are dictionaries in Python see in Python we are basically having four builtin data type to store collection of data list set and uh Tuple and dictionary so we have discussed till now list set and Tapas the fourth one which is remaining is dictionary so this thing we'll be discussing in this video everything about Dictionary what is dictionary why we need dictionary when we need a dictionary to store collection right and how this is different from other uh builtin data type that are used to store collection like list Tuple and set the difference and some builtin functions what we can perform on dictionary how we can you know Define a dictionary everything we'll be discussing in this video in detail with the help of program practically also I'll show but

clear your doubts and then pay the fee and then enroll in the course so all the relevant links and details you'll find in the description box of this video you can even check out now let's see okay let's take a real example like in our home also we are having dictionary if you don't know meaning of anything we just used to search that meaning of that word in dictionary okay nowadays we just search on Google the meaning of that word but we used to have dictionaries once right now if suppose you want to search meaning of beautiful so we will search like from index like from where the letters of B would be started then B then b e then ultimately we'll search where is this that beautiful after finding that word beautiful we will see the meaning of that beautiful that word right like this so how the the this data is to be stored in dictionary like first beautiful and then meaning meaning of this right means in a form of key and value this is key and this is value another word like awesome this is key and here we have meaning of that word like this if suppose you want to search in a dictionary you want to search for number of any one so we'll search first like the name Jenny okay Jenny and then we will get the phone number ultimately we will receive the phone number so here Jenny is the key and phone number is the value of Jenny so key and value pair in real life we used to deal with these type of data Arrangements every day right now this type of data Arrangements we can also imitate in programming language in Python in the in program if we use to store this type of data arrangement in a key and value pair then we have something and name is same that is dictionary we have a data structure or we can say a builtin data type we have to store collection of data that is dictionary see in a list what do we store something like this like one two three or like string also we can store out any float value we can store something like this list of items in a set also something like this any set of items and tuples also but in form of pair if you want to store the key and value pair for that particular thing we are having dictionary like I'm going to store roll number of student and then name of that student like Jenny dolomer of the student then if we write down in resistor maybe something like this we can write 1 and dash or one equal to or one column something like this we write but here we have a proper syntax that also I will tell you in programming to suppose Ram three anyone right so here also we are having key and value pair if you want to find out name of any student just if you know the roll number just look for the roll number of that student and you will get the name of that story roll number two what is the name just look after in your resistor what is the where is the roll number two and then you will get the name so this is key this is value right suppose in a Company employee ID and employee name or maybe employee name and salary of that employee like this type of data Arrangement if you need then we use this type of built area type that is dictionary in Python right so it is used to store collection of data in the form of key value pair key value pairs I hope you got what is dictionary and what is simple you know definition or meaning of dictionary and why we used which kind of data if you want to store and see this is very helpful why so I have already told you because using dictionaries we can imitate or you know that real world data arrangement in programming where each key is associated with a particular value right that type of thing that type of scenario data arrangement we can imitate or we can copy or we can as it is do in programming with the help of this data type right so what is the syntax how to store just if you want to create a dictionary name of that dictionary any name equal to in these braces curly braces key colon value the syntax is very important first of all key then column then value this is General syntax so if I want to store like phone number of my friends so dictionary name I'm taking foreign underscore number and here key key means suppose obviously phone number if I want to store then first I'll write name then phone number so name is what am I writing name Ram so Ram is what a string so then colon then one two three four something like this phone number more than one entry is also allowed just you have to do comma and whatever you want to store suppose next is sham three four five six comma Mohan one one one one any phone number so in this dictionary we are having three key and value pair Ram this Shaman for Mohan no this is how you can create a dictionary if you want to access then simply we just like print and phone number you will get this thing but there are alternative ways also to create a dictionary one method is this the simplest one we have a dick method using that also we can create a dictionary we can now we can access individual item also in a list if you want to access list or Tuple we use index indexing method we use if we have a list then here we write down list name and then these bracket index 0 1 2 3 4 corresponding to that index you will get the value but here we are having how to access using keys we are having keys so if suppose I want to find out roll number of sham so what you will look for first of all the name of name of that particular person so I look for the name that is sham the key and corresponding to that I will get the phone number so using keys we can access individual items or the values from the dictionary how I'll show you practically I will show you now everything okay what are the properties of this dictionary that also I will show you when we will do some practical right like for list and certain Tuple we are having properties so for dictionary also we are having some properties first one dictionaries are ordered but since 3.7 was dictionaries are ordered in 3.6 version and before that in earlier version dictionaries are unordered means ordered means na you have defined a particular order now you cannot change that order if I will print that dictionary so in the same order these items would be printed first Ram this value then sham then Mohan it's not like that I have defined this something like this and whenever whenever I print then first it will give me Mohan then sham then Ram or maybe no whatever order is this in same order it will print means dictionaries are ordered since python 3.7 version mutable also you can change the values if you want to edit the phone number from you can edit you can add any item here you can remove any item here means dictionaries are mutable but these keys these should be immutable keep this thing in mind immutable means either a string or a number or Tuple these Keys should be immutable but values are mutable we can change the values right and no duplicates are allowed one key can have only one value like if you want to store rather than Mohan I'm again writing RAM and phone number is this it's not like that key this is duplicate key so this is not allowed if you will do this thing no error would be there but ultimately whatever value you will assign in the last that would be considered as final value for that key so it will only print Ram 1111 sham three four five six okay this value would be discarded the last time at the last you have assigned Ram this phone number so this would be the final phone number right so these are some properties okay now basic idea you will get the syntax and all now let's do some practical of these things and just you know find out what different different builtin function we can use here many builtin functions as well right okay so let's create a new file here and dictionaries dot p y this name I'm taking let's create a dictionary any value or any information you can store I'm just taking an example of soding phone number any value which is in the form of key and value like student name roll number or anything or like information of employees name then age then phone number something like this anything you can store so I am taking phone number simplest method is name of the dictionary this curly braces and then first suppose I'm writing name this is a string so definitely it would be in curly bracket sorry quotes double quote or single code then colon and then value like one two three four this is the phone number okay so three items I am having so yeah that is it's okay it will not give any error but according to the you can say convention is there in Python whenever you will write dictionaries if suppose we are writing something like this if I am having a definition of something like uh definite first definition of code or definition of algorithm so here I write algorithm and then here I'll write definition in 102 line then comma definition of program then definition of code so it would be very you know it would be not so readable if you write down just in single line like first algorithm definition of that then comma from there only start another item no so what is the convention for more to look your program more readable then with some indent first item comma then in next line second item then comma in third line third item then at last with no indentation we will close the dictionary so this is the convention although if you write down everything in one line that will not give any error but this is more readable right and if you want to add another item just comma enter you can add another item right or if you like to put comma in the end that is also fine it will not give any error okay so let's run this okay because we haven't printed anything so it will not print anything let's print this dictionary print and just name of dictionary phone number that's it so let's run this and see it will print like this the SRAM sham and Mohan key and value pair everything if you want to access phone number of a particular you have to provide the key if any specific item you want to index specific value you want to in Access then name of the dictionary in these subscript brackets no index because in list and Tuple we use index here we write down key so just write down the name of that person suppose I want to access for number of sham see sham is string so as it is you have to write down the key sham is a string so in quotes and second thing case sensitive this is case sensitive so you have to be very careful if you have written this S capital this should be Capital right so let's run this and I will show you see for number of charm is three four five six right if you write down something like this small is let's run this it will give you a error see key error in line number six in line number six I am having a clearer so this is the common mistake generally you know many students do just a typo error so you have to keep in mind this thing the key is should be same and if it is a string it should be in quotes if you will not put here quotes it will give error let's run this see name Ram is not defined okay so if it is a string so you have to put it in single quarter double quote right if it is integer that is fine next thing next property of this is what this is how you can access particular item next I have told you duplicates are not allowed so again if I assign Ram equal to and six and yeah and see this is also you cannot write down here Ram equal to 6666 it should be colon I have told you the syntax so this is also one of the common mistake okay I'm just getting this one so let's print dictionary the all the values let's run this all the items see Ram the phone number of RAM is now 6666 it's not one two three four I have told you if you do so if duplicate keys are there then whatever value will assign in the last that would be the final value of that fee so six is six six right only one time it will take ram okay next property is what now we have another method also to create this dictionary just phone number equal to we have a date function date and here you can pass this values these items so I'm just copy pasting these dick that brackets right round brackets and then as it is you can pass whatever you want to write in dictionary curly bracket then key and value pair key and value pair key and value pair right so if I comment out the previous one and this is our final one using dict so it will give you same like this so this is second method otherwise you can also pass each item as a pair this is the complete item key and value complete one this is one item this is second item this is third item so this one item you can pass has a pair something like this now in this case rather than curly braces we use square bracket right and like this dict then each item you can pass as a pair Ram comma the value sham comma phone number Mohan comma phone number in round bracket and this value ah sorry this bracket square bracket right okay let's run this and this will also show you the same so these are some methods to create but the simplest one is this one so we'll use that only let's just comment this out you will remove the comment of this now next is okay I have told you these are order so see in the same order it is printing the first item is Ram then sham then in the same order it is printing next is mutable okay so the values are changeable now if I want to change the value of the phone number of suppose Mohan I can change how just name of the dictionary in this square bracket what key for what you want to change the value just pass that key as it is Mohan same name then sorry net equal to and whatever the phone number you want to assign 9999 okay now I'll print the dictionary again okay so let's run this again and see at first the same whatever you have assigned then we have updated phone number of Mohan and then see the phone number of 1 is 999 so this is how you can update any item okay next is okay now the values or these values can be of any data type see I am saying values can be of any data type any int float list Tuple dictionary set anything but these Keys should be immutable Mutual means either number or list sorry numbers tuples or strings these are immutable data types right so here a dictionary can also contain list as well as a dictionary itself dictionary inside a dictionary means nested nested dictionary so let me just show you now rather than here Mohan one thing I want to add a list Mohan is having two phone number so I am adding a list of phone number whatever Mohan is having rather than this one or I'm not changing I am adding one more item sorry one more name and that is madhav and for madhav I'm adding two for number one one one comma two two three or suppose three four number three three three so this is a list of phone number that is also fine you can add let's run this see before updation this is a dictionary and after that we have one more item and this is the thing so list is also allowed it's not like that you can only write down here maybe integer or string at all no even dictionary is also allowed one more item I want to add phone number and suppose I want to modify sham sham sham is having two phone number and I want to add these two phone number in the form of key and value pair sham home and Sham office right this thing so that is a dictionary key and value pair this I want to add and then let's print phone number let's run this C first one is without modification then we have added RAM for sham we have updated C sharp and then this is having a again dictionary then Mohan then madhav like this so the values can be of any data type right now if you want to access suppose if you want to access this phone number of sham see what it will print is not defined this is string so you have to put in quotes see first of all and we are printing this phone number the completed dictionary so this is the first print statement and then for Sean I am printing so this is the second print statement so sham is having two phone number in the form of dictionary this and this so if sham work I want to access then what you will write sham here then again here we I will write underscore work let's run this and it should print 4444 C so this is how you can access okay using get method also we can access these things so let's print we have for how to use that method phone number dot get and here same for which key you want to access the key name it's Ram let's run this c one two three four right but one problem with get method is what if I write down here suppose small RM so if you don't use get method then it will give error key key value error because Ram this is not here Capital Ram is there right but this will not give any error it will just show you none so if you want like some error should be printed if I either if I write down here a wrong key then definitely we will not use this get get method previous method we will use okay okay I have one assignment or a question for you if this is a dictionary data this one data I am having one is the key and value is Jenny then 2 RAM 0 Mohan and I'll print data and here in subscript I am passing only 0. what would be the output of this thing pause the video and think so what it will print see 0 here is not index so don't think at zeroth index we have one Journey it will be in this thing no 0 here his key because we are accessing dictionaries so k k is this thing this is 0 so it will print Mohan value this Mohan let's run this C it is printing Mohan okay I hope you got this thing also he also will not you know mistake you will not do this this silly mistake so here the second uh second is what rather than the string here in keys I am using integer so that is also allowed it's not like that only string I can use okay string integer sorry string or numbers or tuples we can use because these are immutable least we cannot use list as key we cannot use because let's start new table now if you want to delete if you want to delete any item from this dictionary we have a method Del Dell just name of the dictionary and name of that key what you want to delete like Ram and then if you print phone number then see what it will print first is this one without updation then we have deleted Ram then see there is no Ram at first I'm having shown this print will because we have deleted Ram here so that key and value that would be deleted so using Del we can delete using pop also we can delete how we can you can delete that thing see you have to use name of the dictionary phone number Dot poke function we have pop and here save that particular key name so suppose I want to delete sham and if you want to print see it will return also pop will remove the value of that this particular key and it will return that value so if you want to print what the scope will return you can print that thing also and after that we are going to print phone number right so first is Ram sham and Mohan then this pop it will return the value corresponding to this key sha so corresponding to Sham we are having three four five six three four five six and then after that it will print RAM and Mohan no sham so using pop also you can delete a particular item and we have one more function for python that will delete the last item added the last one since python 3.7 version this is the case but before that version in 3.6 version and earlier version pop item was used to delete any random item any random item it deletes right now if I use here for python so same phone number name of the dictionary Dot pop item see we are having pop and pop item two or buy them right so it will delete the last one last one added is Mohan so let's run this and see first of this then whatever it will delete it will return that key and value both so Mohan and this this item it will return that item but pop will return only the value and after that RAM and shyam okay so this is Pop item when we have clear clear will delete all the items from this dictionary let's run this C it's none right and it will return n nothing so let's just remove this it will not return anything so we are not printing anything so let's run this again see first dictionary was this and then after clear method it's empty nothing is there okay if you want to access only keys so we have also a builtin method name of the dictionary Dot keys let's run this and see first is the dictionary because we have printed here phone number right then only Keys dict unders if you want to print only values for that also we have a function builtin function Dot values okay now let's run this see dick Keys dict values right we have one more function that is item so if you want to print that also what it will return let's see one number Dot this function is very important items let's run this see first was this then Keys then values we have printed then dot items so item will print list C square bracket is there so it is a list list of all the items but in the form of tuples see this is a tuple Ram one two three four in round bracket so one Tuple two double Sweet Apple in for Loop also we can Loop through this dictionary using four so four if I write 4 any suppose simple any variable and I'm taking I in phone number and I'm just printing I what do you think what it will print let's just comment out these lines for I and phone number and print I what do you think about it will print let's see only the key is Ram sham and Mohan and corresponding to these keys if you want to print values I can write down something like this print and phone number and in this subscript you can pass I because this is how you can access the values by passing the key let's run this now see Ram then value then charm then value then okay and in for Loop also we can use that item function so phone Dot items so it will print key and value pair right so in this case if I print this I what it will print C all these items in Tuple but individual first is this second is this third is this or you can say it will return our list of Tuple pairs and if you want to copy this dictionary to another one for that also we have we have a function inbuilt function copy so what you can do the name of second dictionary suppose for number two equal to the stationary phone number dot we have a function C copy and after that just print phone number two let's run this so see first print statement is phone number this phone number I am printing then we are just copying this and then I am printing for number two so same you will get so if you want to copy as it is content you can do that thing also and if you want to find out length of prediction for that also we have a function Len function so you can just print using Len function blend and the name of that dictionary let's just comment out these two lines let's run this C length is three one two three item you're having so length is three so this is there are many builtin functions also you can just check out you can just Google that functions and you can try to use those functions what are you know generally we whatever function we will use that I O told you but there are many functions in build function you can just try out many functions and if you're not getting anything you can just ask me in comment section like how this function is working right so that is all about I think dictionaries so I hope you got what are dictionaries in Python how this these are different from list set and tuples some properties some builtin function in dictionaries the syntax and how we can use when we should use dictionaries in python or in our program right so now I'll see you in the next video in the next video we'll see when coding system based on dictionaries okay till then bye take care
