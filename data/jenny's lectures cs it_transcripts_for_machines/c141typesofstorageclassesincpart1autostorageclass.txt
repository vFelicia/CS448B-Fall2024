so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing stories class concept in c in the previous video we have discussed what is a storage class why we need storage class what storage class tells about a variable you can say what is the significance of a storage class right or you can see that video was about you can say the introduction of stories class the basic points so i would recommend you go to that video first then come to this video now i have told you there are four type of storage classes automatic register extern external and static right one by one we are going to discuss all the types of stories classes in this video we will talk about auto stories class everything about this storage class you know all this you know every single point all the important points also i'm going to tell you with the help of a program practical also i'll show you how to use this auto storage class in your program right so that also i'll show you on my laptop right now before that just want to tell you one thing as promised in the last video i am here with information on the biggest virtual event in 2022 and i am sure you are going to enjoy these days of unlimited fun

the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's discuss types of stories classes i hope now you are aware about what is the story is class see let me just brief you first whenever we declare a variable like i write int x is equal to 10. so this is data type this is name of the variable right and this is what value of the variable so this thing will tell this data type will tell what kind of value you can store integer value we can store but some other information are also also there associated with this variable right like default value if we are not going to initialize this what would be the default value second one the scope of this variable where we can use scope we have discussed three scope uh one is you can say one is program ah second was function or method scope and one was block these scope we have discussed in the previous video right so what is the scope this variable the lifetime of this variable right and where this variable would be store the location so these things would be told by storage classes right storage classes are also so associated with this variable data type plus storage class two things so types of storage classes are there four types automatic register static and external these four types of storage classes are there and what storage class will tell about this variable default scope sorry default value the scope of the variable location where this variable would be stored in the memory or maybe in the register or in the main memory where and lifetime these four things storage class will take so for these storage classes these things would be different suppose with this variable i am using auto the storage class so for this storage class these four values would be different if i use register how to use storage classes with these variables you just have to write down here right like first storage class is automatic so what keyword we use auto so just use here auto now it means this variable the storage class of this variable is photo now according to this storage class default value of this variable would be what garbage value default value would be for this storage class we are talking about automatic first one automatic auto storage class so the default value would be garbage value these points are very important you just note down these points right now scope is what where you can access this variable where now scope is program one uh sorry function and math function or method or block so the scope of this variable uh the auto storage class is what either it can be a blog or a function right like i'm writing a program something like this so first me just write down scope would be you can say block or it can be function spoke right like how you can use see in main obviously main is a function so here i can declare auto like i am declaring int x is equal to 10 right so this scope is within this function main function right here we can access this we are declaring another block this is what anything which will written here that would be considered as a block so here suppose i am again declaring a variable in x and value is nothing right so this x now this auto this x is having scope block scope and this this x is having function scope right but this auto this storage class cannot have scope program scope means global program means global you know till the end of the program we can use so this is what you can say local variables only local scope this photo can have the storage class can have we cannot declare something like this auto in x is equal to 30 outside of the main function means this would be global variable right and this variable have program scope so this is not allowed when we are using auto storage class this will give error only these scopes are allowed function so for block scope i hope this is clear to you only here we can use if you will print here printf percentage d x and after this block also i am going to print printf percentage d and x so this x value what would be printed we haven't initialized this x right so if you don't initialize the the default value would be garbage value so it will print any garbage value garbage value now after this block obviously this would be destroyed we cannot access the lifetime of this excess within the block so the lifetime would be within the block or you can say till the end of the block we can access the variable variable the auto variable after that we cannot the same as local variable right we have discussed previous also local variable global variable fine this i am just telling you in the terms of storage class right so now the lifetime of this x is within this block after that we cannot access this x so for this x what value would be printed this x is what will access this x the value is 10 in this main function we have x value 10 so it will print 10 right now location is what where this would be stored in main memory right now why i am saying this this would be stored in your you can say stack right i hope you remember that date you can say memory layout we have discussed in the video memory layout of the application for one some i know is for code or instruction we have stack sorry for static and global variable one section is stack one section is e right so that's the location of this this variable would be stored in stack fragment right why i am saying this because maybe you will say all the local variables would be stored in stack yes but there is static variables global variables section is different resistor if we have if you are using storage class register those variables would be stored in the cpu registers that will discuss in the next video all the points about register storage class right so now i think default value is clear to you scope is clear to you and if you will use this thing this would give error location is clear to you lifetime of this storage class is clear to you right now let me show you practically let me show you practically whether it is giving any error or not you will see this program also on our laptop so i hope all the points about this auto storage class is clear to you guys and by default if you will not use anything i'm just using in text so by default with storage class would be considered with this o2 by default right so let me create a new file auto dot c and header file and then in main we'll take one variable auto and x is equal to 10 right then one more or two and x is equal to 20 and we are just printing here printf this x value right x is equal to and just printing x and after this block also we are printing the value print f percentage d so i should use like slash n and x is equal to and then x right so now see this x is having block scope this one and this x is having function scope main is a function or maybe a method scope now let me just run this and show you what output you will get here for this x it will print 20 right and for this x it will print 10 so x is 10 ah sorry first is 20 then 10 and now if we will not initialize this thing then what you will get default value for this auto storage class is what car base value so you are getting x is equal to 43 any value garbage value and for this x you are getting 10 right now see if i declare here auto and x is equal to 89 globally program scope let me just run this and show you whether it's allowed or not c error it will give error file scope declaration of x specifies auto so it is not allowed right only two scopes are allowed you can say block scope is allowed block or method scope right no program scope is allowed for auto storage class i hope now this is clear to you right and lifetime is also clear to you you can access within the block only see this x we can access within this block only if we are using the value x is equal to here 20 so this value would be accessible within this ah you know with help of the sprint f only with this printf statement within this block only right after this block this x will be vanished the 20 value would be vanished right so lifetime is within the block only right and the storage is where you can store in the memory main memory you can see the stack fragment of the memory right default value is garbage value i have shown you the scope also i have shown you so this is about auto storage class so in the next video we will see register stories glass and i'll see the next video till then bye take care
