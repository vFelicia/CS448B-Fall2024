so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen index error like what is index error why you get this index error and how to fix this error right now the next topic is nested list I hope you are clear with what is list and python how to use the list and all we have discussed the thing now we'll be discussing what is nested list right I'll show you practical also see if I make a list something like this suppose I am making a list of numbers numbers is equal to and this is at least like 1 10 15 20 like this right and duplicate elements are also allowed we know so rather than this I can directly I can this 15 we can I can write down again so this is what I list right list of numbers list of names possible or let's you know list need not to be homogeneous this list is also possible like I'm writing 1 10 then I'm writing Jenny a string then I'm writing like true so this is Boolean this is string this is what integer right so this kind of list is also possible mixed data type now what is nested Leaf a nested list within a list suppose rather than writing this thing I am writing something like this this and this so this is one list but within this list I have one more list having 20 minus 10 and 15. so this is what nested list it's not like that we can add more elements also like we I can add something like this so this is nested list because it is list within a list right now the point is if one question for you is if I find out length of this list using length function like length numbers then what would be the length of this list one two three four five six seven eight is it eight or one two three four five six is it six it is six why so because this complete list is considered to be one item of this outer list not three item so the length of this list is one two three four five and six not eight right so this is concept of nestled nested list now how this this list is to be stored let me just show you the memory allocation see we have a list one two three four five and six elements so I have like 1 10 15 then 17 like this and here rather than these elements we are having good reference of this list 20 minus 10 and 15 something like this right now index is 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2. and this list is what the name of this list is numbers so how you can access the element of this simply numbers and the name of the list and in subscript obviously the index so if I write like 0 so it will give one if I write 1 it will give 10 if I write 2 it will give 15 if I write 3 what it will give 20 minus 10 15 something like this right if I write 4 17 5 a 0 but if you want to access the individual individual element of this list then how you can access first of all numbers 3 after that next index would be maybe there is 0 1 or 2 through this we can access like this three then one two or three like three zero it will give 20 this element three one it will give minus 10 something like this and slicing is also possible we have discussed what is slicing right so I hope what is nested list it is clear to you guys now let me just take one example we will make a program and on that we'll be discussing what is how how you can access these elements what is slicing how you can apply slicing on this list also right so I'll show you practically so let's create a new file here nested underscore list okay now I'll making a list like I'm taking list one name and here I'm writing like 10 34 like this so this is outer list this is list within a list so let me just print what would be the length of this list let's select current file and run this see length is 5 okay 1 2 3 4 and 5 this complete is one item only right now if you want to access the element of this list then using obviously using index we can access right so let's just print if I write something like this Now list one and I want to access at Fourth index so at Fourth index we have 89. now because Z 0 1 2 this complete is at third index and then four now let me just access the third index C the complete list you could because at third Index this is the lesson now third index and then again one more index zero now you will get this 45 right at 3 0 we have 45 at 3 2 we have minus 3 I hope you would have to access if there is a next list how to you can access the element rather than this 4578 minus 3 you can put here any names also so strings also allowed like here we have integer here we have string allow because list can contain mixed data type right now slicing and see if I write negative index like minus 2 at minus 2 we have this list only because this is minus one eighty nine at minus 1 negative indexing from backward this is minus two minus 3 minus four minus five something like this right now what is slicing C and see if I write rather than this index I am here just putting Len function Len of list one right and suppose minus 1 if I wrote something like this like list one but rather than providing the direct index I am providing some expression length of the list 1 and then minus 1. now length of this list one is one two three four five then five minus 1 is 4. so index would be both so what it should print 89 right now if I write here minus 2 then 3 Ultimate index would be three so now it is printing this list right so rather than direct index some expression can also be there that would be evaluated and after that just find out the you know index value right okay let's see slicing here okay so list one and I am providing here first third index then at second index nothing slicing means start point and point but if you do not provide provide anything then start point would be by default zero but the first index and ending point would be the length of the list right so length of this list means one two three so zero to three it would be zero to three let's suppose first write a zero two three so it will print this complete list 45 78 and minus 3 but if I do not put 0 and 3 then also it will print this list because by default here we have 0 and here we have 3 right and if you put something like 0 2 I want to access only 0 to 2. okay now what it will print only to element 45 and 78 from zeroth index that is 45 and 2 is what is this two not index it is length of the list length of this list because this third this index 3 that is for outer list so at third index we have this list now for this list we are providing next index so 0 means from 0 to index to 2 2 means length of this list till two length like one and two right so till 78 it will print right means still 2 minus 1 that is one index so 0 to 1 45 and 78 I hope you got this and rather than this one more thing we have at third if you don't do not provide anything here and third part is the step if you have watched my that video uh list in Python then we have discussed this thing also now third is steps so now by default step is one it will print some everything 45 78 minus three and if I write step is two so first it will print it will start from 0 that is 45 then two step means one and two means 45 and minus 3 it will print only not 78 it will skip 78. 45 and minus 3. so like this we can access the list of element of nested list and we can provide slicing on that list so this is basically a basic idea of nested listing python okay so one question for you is this is the list we have list two is this one first of all tell me it is possible is it possible to create this type of list and then you have to tell what is the length of this list and then how you can ex I just want to print this uh like I just want to access this this one the ram then how you can access this Ram what you have to write right so this is for your assignment you have to tell in comment section so I hope you got what is nested list and how to use it how to access the element of nested list so the next video we'll see one coding exercise so now it's my next video bye take care
