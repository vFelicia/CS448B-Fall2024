so in the series of learning python programming language in previous video we have seen what are some primitive data types in python like in float uh boolean and strings although there are many more data types like list range dictionaries and set many more types are there those also will be discussing one by one but basics generally we you know use these kind of data types more and more so these things these data types we have discussed in previous video okay how to use them and all now next thing is if you want to change one data type into another type one type to another type then can you do this thing in python yes we can do and this is known as type casting or type conversion as in c and c plus plus also we can do this thing right if there is an integer we can convert that to float we can convert that to string and vice versa and these kind of things we can do in python also that is known as type conversion or typecasting so this thing will see in this video okay type checking like how to check the type although we have discussed in previous video also like using type function we can do that thing but you will also see this thing and we'll see what is type conversion how to do type conversion type casting and all fine so here i'm uh adding a new file i'm creating a new file new file and just type casting type underscore casting dot p y let's see i have to calculate length of a string we have a len function like len and if i pass here uh jenny catherine so it will find out the length of this genica 3 and i am simply printing that length so just put this function into print function let's run this and see what output just right click on this and run type casting and it will give how many characters are there in this zenika 3 with a space 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. so it will give 12 see the length is 12 okay it's an integer now suppose in length i am doing what i am passing this thing one two three four five what it will give what do you think let's run this and see it will be five ok fine if i write something like this just a number 1 2 3 without these quotes at this time what it will give c it is a type error it is a type error object of type int has no len one two three four five it is an int okay obviously it is a class so it is a variable or you can see it's an object of type hint which is having no lend function lend function is used to calculate length of the strings only so if you pass out the wrong input it will be giving an error but it's a type error not any syntax error okay syntax is correct syntax of line function is correct len and simply in bracket whatever you know for the string you want to find out the length you can just put that thing here but here you are putting in so this is a type error okay same like if we have something like this if we have a you can say coffee machine so you can put here that coffee powder and whatever you want to put like milk and water and all so it will give you coffee but if you uh you know put any you can say curd and you wanna make lassi from that curd and butter so that that machine cannot do that will not work so that coffee machine is like a function so please give proper input the coffee powder and milk and water and all so for this land function also you have to give proper input input is string if you give wrong out wrong input in integer or anything else or a float number it is going to give error but that is type error fine now let's see okay i am giving proper input you can just put in these codes for single quotes that would be considered as string so let's take here i am writing my name jenny khatri and whatever this length that i'm not directly i'm not going to print i'm storing it into a length function sorry ln length variable and i am printing length it's okay it will give 12 fine but now i want to print this line complete line you your name has uh how many character 12 characters this thing so okay we know how to concatenate string we can concatenate your name has and then characters with a plus sign okay fine how you will do i will do like your name has this is a string then plus and then whatever length i'm just putting this then plus and characters what do you think will it work or not let's see let's run this and what it will give see i guess uh you know if you know the data types then here also it will give a type error can only concatenate str not into str so your name has this is a string characters in double quote this is a string but length this is what int length jenny ca3 will give 12 that is an integer so this length will have the number 12 that is an integer we cannot concatenate into a string so it is a type error so now how to solve this problem can we convert this length this integer value to string yes we can do how you can do just write down str in bracket you have to put length now this length it will take integer value but it will convert this function str length will convert it into string now it will work fine let's run this and see now see your name has 12 characters now you are able to concatenate so i hope you got this this is what type casting or type conversion how to check that i have already told you like you can check print and we have a function type and i want to print now i want to check the data type of this length variable so just do this thing now let's run this and now at this point of time this length is having of class int but if you do something like this i am writing like new underscore length equal to str length and after this i am finding out this data type of new length now let's run this and now at this point type it will give you str okay because you have converted okay this length to sdr for this for this line only we are not storing that value in any variable so for this thing it has been converted but after that if you just simply write print and if you want to want to check type l e and gts length then let's run this and what it will give c new length this for this print it is giving class str but for type length it is giving class hint for this line only it has converted but you haven't stored that converted string length into another thing still length variable is of pin type i hope you would have to convert so same we have something like this we have more functions also like int we have load we have str that we have seen see these triple quotes these are multiple line commands so these lines are comments now into this will convert something into int float will convert into float strv will convert into str okay now i hope you know how to check how to convert how to do type conversion how to check the type of you know these variables now i am suppose i am printing print 10 sorry print 10 plus 10 what it will give these are integer whole basically you know simply will do addition and it will print 20. see but if i do print this thing i'm going to put these 10 and 10 in double quotes so at this time you will get 10 10 concatenation okay fine if i do something like this just convert this string 10 into integer how to convert write down this end function before this and in bracket this string then int and this thing now you have converted this both the 10 into integer at this point of time you will get 20. see now you are getting 20 because you have converted this string into int okay if i write something like this a is equal to or suppose i am writing print 10 i'm writing 10 plus this 10 it will give it because this is what integer this is what string so we can convert this into first of all into a float suppose you want to convert it into float so float 10 and that's it now it will run and it will give you 20.0 although we haven't done any we haven't write any decimal point but you are converting it into float so automatically it will put a decimal sign and dot 0 so 20 dot 0 so this is how you can convert these things but it is not correct see if i write name equal to jen and you want to do print 10 10 plus suppose you want to convert this name let's convert you think let's convert this name into end and then add 10 so both are in int so it will add these thing but this point of time you will get an error although you are getting for this 20 for this uh 20.0 but in line number 18 see this is line number 18 it is giving an error value error this time value error invalid literal for ind for ind with base 10 so this in this end this name you are giving this is invalid you cannot pass this thing it is not having base 10 see if i write name is equal to 1 2 3 and then i do this thing yeah that will work fine it will give you 133 this print will give you 133 let's just comment these line out and now let's run this now you can see it is giving you 133 because now this name is having base 10 one two three oh it is decimal number so base 10 but jenny was not having base 10 that is why it has given you value error okay so i guess now you know how what is type error when you get type error how to check type of the variable just to use type function and how to do type conversion or type casting in float and with the help of in float and str functions right now one assignment for you is one exercise for you is you have to take input from the user okay like two numbers you can take input from the user what is first number what is second number and then you have to add those two numbers okay this is for your assignment assignment so let's pause the video and do it right now okay so how many of you have written this kind of thing like we are taking two variables obviously i am taking first underscore number is equal to input function input enter first number then second number you can take variable m abc xyz also i'm just taking meaningful meaningful name second underscore number is input enter second number and just two sum is equal to first number plus second number and just print sum how many of you have done this thing let's see the answer in the first number suppose i'm entering 1 second number 2 but it is the output is 1 2 it's not 3 so where is there see if you have remembered this input function whatever you will enter you you will take input from this input function that would be considered as string actually so this one is considered as string this two is also string and this plus is just concatenating these two strings one two so okay this is the problem how to you know you have to convert these numbers these things these strings now into integer so you can do this because you know how to convert this thing just convert this like int first number can break it right on first number int and here write down in bracket second number that's it now let's run this and this time see the output now it will ask you same first and first number and second number center first number one two at this time it is printing three because now you have converted i casted the numbers okay so this is the case i hope you got the solution of this exercise also okay so now in this video and the next video will also see one coding exercise for you guys that is little bit difficult there also you have to you know use all the things you have learned by far you know till this video you have learned okay so now in the next video till then bye take care
