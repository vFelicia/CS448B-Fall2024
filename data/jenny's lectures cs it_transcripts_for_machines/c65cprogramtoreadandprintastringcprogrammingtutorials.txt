so in the series of learning programming in CV have discussed theory about strings like what is string how to read a string scan if how to use scan a function get his function print F and put his function right in this video we'll see a simple program like how to read a string and how to print a string we'll see practically not on this whiteboard because we have discussed the synex of you know how to read a string how to print a string that we have discussed in previous video so in this video I'll show you the program on my laptop right you'll use both scanf and gets function printf and puts function and I'll show you everything like how you can use those function in different different ways so now let me create a file string first dot C right then we use header file okay main function sorry and here first of all we declare a string suppose I'm taking string as um name and here I'm taking 30 characters right so first thing here you can initialize uh the string like I'm writing here gen that's it and I want to print using print F the format specifier is percentage s and you just have to provide here name of the string that is name and I guess that's it now we can run it and let's see what happens it should print genu on screen right see it is printing joury right and if here I'm writing here katri so let me just run this again see it is printing Jen katri because we are initializing here right so that is one way or you can initialize character by character right that is another way something like this like this but here we will provide explicitly what null character because string would always be ended with a null character and let me just save it and run it see it is printing joury right so I guess that is fine now we will initialize the string at run time I'm not initializing here I'm just using print a fun sorry scan a function right so at first it should ask enter name right and now I'm using scanner format specifier and here we don't need to put any for Loop and address of operators directly you can write down the name of the string it is pointer to the first um uh character of the string so I'm just using scan if and then I'm printing whatever I'll enter I'm just printing that thing so I guess that's it now let me just run it again see it is asking enter name and I'm entering j e n y and see it is printing Jenny right let me just run this again and here I want to print j e n y space kri now what output you will get only Jenny see it is not taking kri it is only printing Jenny because scanner will not consider this white space in string that we have discussed right if you want to take input both like this a complete line or you can say then we use what get or second way is what you can use here what two percentage s like if I'm using here percentage s name suppose I'm F name I'm taking two string obviously you have to take and last name right so here also we use what car name f name and L name that is also suppose 30 right and here I'm printing F name and last name so here also what percentage s so I think that's it let me run this see it is asking enter name and I am entering Jenny space katri now it is printing Jenny katri but with no white space why because in this print F percentage s percentage s so here you can if you write space if in print F you will you know just uh write or press space here then it will print something like this will print with space right obviously we don't want this thing so that is why we use what gets I'm just know taking what back to this program 30 enter name and rather than scanf I'm just com commenting this out both print F and scanf right and here now rather than scan if I'm using get S and what is the syntax directly you pass the name of the string get name right and print F percentages comma name directly you can print something like this right so now let me run this here I'm entering suppose here Jenny's lectures is best Channel for CS it printing the complete line Jenny's lectures is the best channel for csit right because we are using gets so when when you press enter or the new line then only it will stop reading but here I have shown you the problem the the that buffer overflow problem we have discussed with both scanf and Gus see care name the size is only 30 30 character I mean we should enter 29 character and one null character at last that would be appended automatically right but here characters are obviously more than 30 here so but but still it is printing this thing still it is going to read the complete string it is not giving any error any warning or anything so I think we should not use this kind of thing we should not do this kind of thing that is why gets is very risky to use because it is going to allocate memory it is going to store this complete line beyond the allocated memory and and maybe it can override some critical program that is very helpful for your PC right so that is a buffer overflow problem I guess you got it both with scanf also will do this thing if you write here scanf right and without space if you write complete line Journeys lectures the best for csit like this without any space obviously the if you know press any space then it will not read but without space if you write and till you you know press enter till then it will try it will try to read the complete line so that is buffer uh overflow problem here so now see we will uh see now what print F and put s now here I'm using put and what's the syntax here just have to pass the name to put s I'm using then you will get the difference okay so output should be three names it should print one is print F then two put is I'm using so now let me save it and run it see it is asking enter name so I am entering here jti kri right with space and because we are using gets so let me just press enter here and see three times first jti katri then second and then third is in next line why so because first jti katri is output because of the Sprint F next output because of this pest in the same line and pest is what pest will automatically add a new line at the end of the string while you are printing right means after printing the entire string the cursor would be in next line so the output of next pest would be would be next line I hope you got this point also right now next thing is if if you do something like this like I'm printing here Point uh five only five means I want only five characters first five characters of my name and next I'm printing print F 10.5 right s field width also I'm specifying here and that is name but I think better to use here what slashing and here also slashing then you will get it better all right now let me just run this and here I'm entering see first is j a YN only five character because of the Sprint f second print f 10 field width and only five character that is why that is and that's what it right uh you know Justified so this output and this is because of the pce so I hope you got this also right and if you want to take input using scanf one thing you can do with scanf something like this like if I'm writing here percentage five s right and here I'm passing name so now what output you will get see I'm entering jti and without space katri right or maybe jti only seven characters we have right and I'm pressing enter but still it is printing J YN only five and see obviously this will print only five because we are using five in in both the printer but put should print J but it is also printing j y and why so because we have specified in scan F percentage 5S means it will read only five characters whatever you will enter after five characters it will not read so that limit you can set here in scanf this thing also you can do right one more thing what you can do in print f one more print F I'm using here and percentage s and here I'm specifying address of from index second name two means what output you should get here in this case see I just want to run this and I'm writing here one slashing I'm just commenting out this put s and puts I hope you got the working of this and this print F also and this print F also and in scan F or not scanf I'll use gets rather than scanf right only one output I want here so now let me just run this and it should ask name that is jti katri enter see what it is printing it is going to to start printing from why because of we are providing address of name of two address of second index 012 right so it is not printing whatever in at zeroth index that is J at one index that is a at second index it is y so address we are providing from y so uh from y it is going to print and till what till it finds null character that is till K I hope you got everything about gets SC F and print F and put s right so that's it for this video now
