so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen four else right we have discussed for Loop and four else right now we'll be seeing one coding exercise based on that with the help of four Loop we will do this exercise so what what is the program you have to write down a program to calculate average height from a list of heights maybe you are thinking it's very simple yeah definitely it's very simple but there is some twist it's not like that just take a list of height something like this like list one I'm taking and here we can take some I like 151 53 60 even 40 like this and then what some of these Heights we have a inbuilt function Euro in list that is sum so that we can use to do sum and we know how many elements one two three four four elements so sum divided by four and you will get the average no or maybe if you want to find out the length of the list then also we have one function that is len function that will give you length of this and simply you can just divide and that is average no there is some twist right so first of all note down some points first thing you cannot use sum and Len functions right you have to replicate their functionalities with the help of for Loop right we'll be using for Loop to replicate these functionalities we cannot use inbuilt functions right next thing is we cannot take something like this you have to take input from the user using input function right will take user input using input function function so you have to wear about this function right the properties and functionality of this function third thing is what now the output should be you know uh it's a whole number you have to round the answer to the nearest whole number so three things you need to take care right first thing let me just repeat we cannot use these two functions Second Use input function to take input from the user third thing the answer should be rounded off to the nearest whole number third thing right now let me just give you some hint or maybe if you have done that exercise who will pay the bill I think that was coding exercise 11 or 12. so in that we have used one function split split so here also you have to use this function first function is split you have to use right because whenever you take input from the user using input function that would be considered as a string right and I have told you average height from a list of heights so to have you have to convert that into list so split will divide and something like this right so you must have heard about I think this split function right if not you can Google out this and you can use this right uh second function will be using uh range range now what is this range see if I write range 5 so it will give you 0 1 2 3 4. five numbers total but by default it will start from 0 till 4 if you write range 10 it will give 0 to 9. if you want to specify a particular range like I want from 11 to 20 so you can specify 11 2 here not 20 because it will give 11 12 13 14 till 19. this this is start this is stock stock minus one if you want till 20 then you should specify here 21. so range will just produce the generate a series of numbers by default we'll be starting from 0 so you don't need to specify the starting point but you have to specify the ending point where you want to end the range the sequence right and third is also step size but for this for this you know uh exercise that is enough start Point stop point and range we will be discussing you know in detail this range function in later videos so two function you need to use a split and range right so now I guess you know what you have to do you have I think you understood this problem statement so now pause the video and try this out so I hope you are done with this exercise if you got stuck then it's okay let's see the solution so let me just create a new file first here coding for size 14 Dot py okay so first we'll take it from the user let's take a variable Heights and with input function we will take right okay now using input we will see like enter All Height separated by a space so whatever suppose this I am entering let me just comment this section in the South this line 151 153 like 140 or 160 and 167 something like this these are the heights but now this is what a string because using input function you are taking this input so this is what a complete string but I want the separate this should be a separate item 151 height of one person or student 153 height of second person right so what we can do what we can split this string we have a split function using that that will convert the string into a list right and that will split each item here so how we can use that split function the variable is high in height we have the value Heights Dot split function right and here will be on which like a separator from where you want to split this string so I want to split wherever it split function find a space split that like 151 after that we have a space so split from here 151 would be a separate item then 153 then again a space then one five three that is a separate item right so on space I want to split if you want to split based on comma so simply you can put here while inputting you can put here comma and here you can specify like I want to split this based on a comma right but I want to split this hair separator is a space so nothing you need to specify here right now after splitting it will create a list so that list I'll be storing in a variable in a list the name I am taking like height underscore list okay now if you want to check out then you can just simply print this height underscore list and let me just run this for you and I'll show you the output enter All Height separate by a space like one five three one four two three four one two like I'm taking any as randomized see now this is what a list now 153 is a separate item 142 is a separate item but here the problem is 153 is in these quotes means it is a string still it is a string but we want integer write note string so what we will do now you have to convert each item of the list into int yeah we know we can type cast using it so maybe you are thinking here only we can use like in something like this in tight split but no no no that will give you an error that is not a good idea see if you run this you will get an error something like you want this is just to show you the error see type error intar argument must be a string so this int argument this must be a string a byte like object or a real number not a list because High tote split is it is a list and in in argument we cannot give a list right so okay that's not a good idea so how you can convert each and every item into integer First Take 151 convert it into then 153 convert it into inch then 140 convert it into it so you have to Traverse the complete list it's okay we have four using that we can Traverse the list right okay let's see let's you know the index of syntax of 4 Loop four a variable name that I'm taking is suppose I now in in maybe you are thinking just take this variable name height list this is because this is a list so using index we can fetch the value so if you write like height list and I is equal to each and every item because you have to convert height list hi okay maybe you are thinking this will work we are taking every element and we are converting that into int and then then we are printing this okay let's run this end check C here we got an error syntax error okay for we have to put here a colon let's run this again suppose height I'm entering something like this any height but still you are getting a type error list indices must be integer or slice not string this index now in height list we have this list suppose this list so now first of all in i151 would be assigned about 151 is a string so in I it will be 151 but this index should be a integer not a string okay and obviously index of this is 0 1 2 3 4 so I want to access because rather than the PSI 151 here should be zero then one for 153 here should be one then two then three then four something like this so we cannot use like in height list we cannot Traverse this something like this this is wrong so I have given you second hint use a range function range from 0 to or if you not give 0 then by default it will take zero but I want from 0 to c Index would be 0 1 2 3 4. then we can give here 5. but next time if user enter 10 Heights then this range function will be from 0 to 4. what about that next time I'll give seven Heights then so we cannot write down here static value 5. you have to find out the length of this list length of this list is one two three four five right and we cannot use LINE function for that so how you can find out the length okay for finding out the length we will take suppose a variable count we have variable count at starting count is having zero value now for Loop four I am taking a variable height suppose hi in height list just Traverse this list height list and for every element just add sorry count equal to count plus one for every element add at starting count would be 0 then now in this for Loop in this variable name this height list is suppose this one so 151 would be assigned right 151 in the site list yes it's true enter here then count becomes count plus one count becomes one then 153 would be assigned here this is also 3153 is in the list right then again enter here then count becomes 2 like this so how many times this list this for Loop would be iterated one two three four five times so now at last count becomes 5. now we got the length right without using Len function I hope you got the working of this thing right now in count finally we have what five let's print count and I'll show you let's print count here and uh just comment down these lines right so let's run this okay like I have given one two three four Heights so enter see the length is 4 means count is 4 means we have calculated the length 4 right okay now fine now we can use this count this variable here 0 to it should go range is 0 to count right or if you're not specify 0 that is also fine because by default it will give it will take zero the range would be from 0. I have given you the Cent right now height list I is equal to entire list i n that's it now print height list so let's run this again I'll show you the output one two three four five or fifty six I know how height would not be one at all because we will take in centimeter so one centimeter is not you know it's a meaningful height but just to get you familiar with this range and in this function see first of all count will print one two three four five five elements so it will print five and now at this time c one two three forty five fifty six but there is no these quotation marks so now this time the 1 2 3 45 is now integer now if you have successfully converted this into hint till now I go I hope you heard this thing right okay now next step is what so I hope now no need to you know explain the working of this for loop I guess you can dry run this for I in range count is what here suppose we are taking this example so count is five zero to four it will generate the number so first of all is 0 to 4. like this 0 1 2 3 4. so first of all the zero would be assigned to this I now height list 0. is equal to int height list 0 so height list 0 means at zeroth index we have 51 that would be converted into int and that would be assigned into again here height list I so now 151 become integer then 153 like this right okay now rather than printing this height list here what we will do you have to calculate now sum we have total because we have calculated count we have like length of the list we can calculate now you have to calculate some of these elements and then we can simply divide so for sum what we will do at first okay we will take any variable like sum is equal to 0. we are going to Define a variable now Traverse the list and add one by one each item in the sum very simple okay and for traversing we have a full loop so four you can take any variable you can take again I or height same variable you can take anything you can take right a b c x y z or for each for Loop you can take I I I or height height or any other that is fine but suppose I am taking here for person in height list for each portion in this height list the variable name I'm taking this time person right sum equal to sum Plus person or rather than this we can use shorthand like this some plus equal to person that is also fine same thing sum is equal to some plus personal sum plus equal to percent right okay it will add one by one each element till 157 and finally we can print sum but we want average so rather than printing sum what we can do calculate average so suppose we have a variable AVG if average is equal to this sum rather than sum because sum is a function here so we cannot take variable name as function name so we'll take total so rather than printing this total we will do what we'll just directly calculate average array is equal to total divided by count right and we can simply print AVG okay let's run this and see what output we will get okay we'll take height 151 153 and 142 160 is 167. that's it five Heights we are taking enter see it will print first of all count the length is 5 then 154.6 but one thing we haven't done till yet we have to round this to the nearest whole integer so it would be rounded to 155. right I hope you know the working from function we have done this also we have you know discussed round function also so better to round this using round function round AVG okay let's run this now I'll be using the same input again let's run this again and same this time C 155 we have rounded the soap to 155 the nearest hole in design previous it was 140 154.6 right so this is our program I hope this is not so much complicated so if you if you haven't get this it's okay just focus on this just write down this this coding on a pen and paper on your paper right dry run this take it take one example dryer on this one by one with your hand right and then definitely you will get it right it's not that tough or simply like something like this if you want to print like this like uh average height is something like this we can also do rather than simply printing that so let's run this again for the same so average height is 155 okay but the main thing is I think you have there are three or four points like you have to understand split function then how to calculate length with the for Loop then what is this range then how to calculate some how to find out some with the help of four Loop without using inbuilt function and average is simple total divided by the length or the count right so that's it for this exercise now so I hope you got this exercise in the next video we will see one more coding exercise so now I'll see you in the next video bye take
