so in the series of running c programming we are discussing file handling in c in the last video we have discussed f seq function in c we are left with one more function that is f tail function so in this video we will discuss about that function everything about this function with the help of a program right practically i will show you in file handling we have some special function like fc caftel rewind so while you are randomly accessing the file then these functions play an important role these functions are having their specific applications right so these are also very important i know in file handling so everything about f2l function we'll discuss in this video but before that this won't tell you one thing for the gate 2022 aspirants an academy has started all india mock test series

discount on your plus subscription so all the details and the relevant links i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is f10 function in c see as the name suggests it will tell something so what it will tell it will tell the position of the file pointer in that file with respect to starting of the file see whatever i am saying let me just you know tell you what i am saying suppose i have a file txt and in this i have jenny kathryn only this i have in this file this is starting of the file right and it would be started like index would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 something like this so now at starting if you open the file in read mode then the file pointer would be here in the starting at here so the position of this file pointer is 0th index 0 so using f10 function you can find out the position of the file pointer if suppose you have moved this file pointer like to a specific position using fc we can do this thing using fseq we have moved this to here to k and after that if you will use f tail function then what it will return 6 because the index of this k is 6 right from the starting 1 2 3 four five six six bytes you have skipped and and the seventh byte the file pointer is right now so it will tell the position of that that file pointer right with respect to starting of the file starting of the file right not end of the file starting of the file one application of this ftl function is what this function is generally used to find out the length of this file now how you can find out the length that also we will see with help of a program right now see let me just write down a simple code see i am opening this file in read more simple read more right and i am just checking if fp is equal to is equal to null means error in opening file or you can say can't open file and directly exit from this point only right otherwise what we will do at first i am going to print where is the file pointer so directly you can use ftl function what is the syntax f10 and simply you are suppo it will accept only one argument that is the file pointer so file pointer is fp right and see return type of ftl function is what long end this is the return type and we have simply f2l and here we will use file pointer here file pointer the name of the pointer right the return type is long end what it will return integer value right so whatever it will return that thing i am going to store in an integer type of variable suppose variable i am taking position pos so before using this you have to declare position pos position is equal to ftl whatever it will return i am going to store in pos and i am going to print that simply percentage d because it is uh you know int the type isn't and i am printing here what p os that's it and at last f close so if you will write down this program then what it will run see you are opening this in read mode so definitely the file pointer at starting would be here only whenever this file would be opened the file pointer will be at the starting of the file so what it will return the pos would be zero so it will return zero here is the file pointer right now suppose i have moved this file pointer using f seek f seek and here i am using fp and the offset i am providing five and from the starting seek underscore set now five is offset so one two three four five right now here file pointer would be at this position here we have space right five byte you are going to skip from the starting and 5.2 would be here so after that if you will print the file position then what it will return percentage directly i am writing in f printf only f10 this also you can do rather than writing this in two line like f tell a pos is equal to f tell then i will print the pos directly you can in printf only you can write down this function f1l pos right so it will print what now the position of file pointer is here so it will return five right if you will move the file pointer backward like fc fp like minus three and seek underscore cur from the current position and after that if you will print this according to that it will give the where is the file pointer right now see file pointer is here suppose here after this printf after this printf i am writing f get c i am reading a single character in ch i am going to store that thing right and i am printing only percentage c ch and after this again i am printing printf percentage d f10 i want to check where is the position of this file pointer so after this see and right now file pointer is here so what it will print space the character is space only right so it will print space right and now f tell f p now what is the position of the file pointer see space it will print and file pointer would be moved to next one if get c will do this thing it will print this and file pointer would be moved here so now at file pointer is now at sixth index so it will print six now right if here you will print a complete string using f scanf you can also do see if after this line in this i have jenny khatri is awesome suppose this i have in this file and after this printf what i am writing f scanf scanf function is used to read from the file formatted read right so what is the syntax file pointer then percentage is the format specifier and whatever you will read the string that i'll store in str in this str right and after this scanf suppose i am printing percentage s this str i am going to print and after this again i am writing percentage d f tell fb so what would be the output right now right now the file pointer is here at k after this line so this khatri would be considered as a complete string right note space if space occurred then end of the string right so this khatri would be considered as a complete string and this would be fast and stored in str now it will print khatri here this language will print khatri right and now what is the position of f tell how many bytes one two three four five six like at six then this is seven then eight nine ten eleven and at twelve now it will print twelve i hope you got this right because we are reading a complete string so now file pointer would be moved what is whatever the length of the string that many characters the file pointer would be moved and now the position of file pointer would be 12. now i have told you this function is also the one application is what to find out the length of the complete file right now what is the length how to find out c i hope now till now you go this right i'm going to rub this and i'm going to write down another syntax fc fp offset is 0 seek underscore end seek underscore end means here we are going to move file pointer backward how offset is what 0 only so file pointer would be here only right and now you can simply print the position of this file pointer whatever the position that would be the length of the file that's it right so simply here you can print printf percentage d f10 fp and what it will print the position of file pointer right now is here so this is how you can use this f2l function to find out the length of the file and if suppose here you have space so one more character that is 23 right so according to that it will print whatever the length of the file right so this is one application of the section i hope now you have some idea about this f tell function how you can use this function and why we use this function right now let me show you practical so let me just create a new file f2l dot c right and we are going to go with this thing because till this line it would be same so just copy this thing right and i'm opening this in r mode only right abc dot txt file in abc dot txt what we have this we have janika three is awesome right this content we have so now at starting rather than using two line i'm just printing the location in one line only percentage d and here only i am using f right fb and f close so it's starting this would be the it what it would print zero right because the file pointer would be at zero within index at the starting of the file right see it is printing zero right now after this f tell c suppose i am using f get c one character i am reading right ch is equal to f get c right and after that again what i want to print the location if you want to print the character you have read that also you can print but here my main motto is to get you familiar with f tail function so after this see let me just format this slash and with slasher so now again i am going to run this and what output you will get here c 0 and next time the file pointer would be at one index if you want to print the character then simply you can add this line and again let me just run this and show you see it will print 0 first of all first is 0 then it will print j j it will print and after that e the index of e is after you know f gate c will first of all print j that character and then cursor would move one position you know uh forward so here we have one next time it will print the location would be one if suppose rather than a single character here i am going to print the complete string i am get i'm writing f scanf fp comma the format specifier would be percentage s and i'm going to print that in str i'll store that in str and rather than ch here i'm printing what str percentage percentages fine and now str i have taken this f p so here we have uh comma right after this i'm printing after printing the string i'm printing what is the location so jenny would be considered as a complete string that would be printed c 0 then jenny would be printed and after that 5 is the that what location of your file pointer phi at fifth index right at space j j j e double n y the length of this string is 5 so length is 5 that is why it is printing after that 5. so if if you want to use this to get the length of the complete file then what you can do here i'm using f seek function offset is 0 and then i'm writing what seek end right so now we have moved the cursor to the end of this file right and after this i am printing the location like printf f10 fp right so now let me just run this and show you what output you are getting see 0 at starting it will print 0 then we are printing a string that is jenny and then we are moving this to the end of the file right from the end of the file 0 is the offset so file point would be to the end of the file and now i am printing the position of the file pointer that is why that's what the length of this file so that is what 23 so 23 is the length of the file you can you know find out you can count these characters these are 25 right so 23 you know 25 23 is the length of this file 23 right so i hope now you got the basic idea about f tail function now you can use this f c also you can use here and then f tell also you can move using fc forward and then from the current position to the backward and again you can use f10 to get the position and this thing i hope you can do yourself practice right so that's it for this video now so that's it for this video and the next video we will see rewind function in file handling so now in the next video till then bye take care
