so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing Loops in C plus plus still now we have discussed for Loop and while loop the next one is dou y Loop and C plus plus so this thing we'll be discussing in this video what is do while loop General syntax of do while loop how to write down do I Loop in your program uh working of this Loop using uh with the help of flowchart as well as with the help of programs two to three programs we will see practical also I will show you on editor we will run those programs and all right plus how this is different from while loop right so these things all the basics all the points and you know about why we will be discussing in this video but before they just want to tell you one thing see the journey towards becoming a

this video you can go and check out now let's see what is do I look let me just uh first of all tell you what is general syntax of this do I look first of all this new keyword write down you will write down followed by these curly braces Within These curly braces this would be body of the loop or you can say this is statement block right here you will write some statements which is to be executed and then after this curly braces we write while and here we write condition admission or you can say expression right termination condition or expression and after that this semicolon this is you know compulsory otherwise you will get an error right so this is General syntax of do while do I Loop right now these statements whatever you will write here these this should be executed again again and again while this condition is true condition is true these statement would be executed repeatedly right but one thing if this condition is not true still one time at least once this these statement would be executed this reason you know make this do while loop different from while loop in while loop if condition is not true body of the loop will not be executed right not even once but here at least once these statements the body of the loop would be executed at least once irrespective of the condition the condition is true or false it doesn't matter and after that after executing once this condition would be checked if condition is true now again this body of the loop would be executed the D statement would be executed till the condition becomes false right so how you can draw this thing in a flowchart see first obviously program is running somewhere we have do while loop so this is you can say body of loop body of dou by Loop right this will be executed irrespective of the condition now next after executing once condition would be checked so simply you can map this thing in flowchart condition would be checked if condition is true if condition is true again body of this this these statement would be executed if the condition is false now you can say exit from do while loop or whatever in your program you will write No statement would be executed but here we can say exit from Loop exit from Loop not exit from program exit from Loop so this is just flowchart basic flowchart of this do while loop right I hope you got the working of this Loop so this is known as exit control Loop two categories are there entry control four and while loop entry control Loop and this do while loop is exit controlled Loop while exiting from the loop we are checking the condition right so this is exit controlled Loop now let me just ah show you an example and let me just show you how this is different with look that example we'll see how this Loop is different from while loop right so sometimes uh we need like two you know execute the statements which are written in the loop of the body at least once without checking the condition sometimes this kind of this type of things happens those things also will discuss with the help of programs right so in those cases it's better to use do while loop rather than while loop right right because at least once we want to execute those statements after that I know we want that the condition should be checked right so in those cases we use dou y Loop now let's see how this is different from while loop so with the help of these two uh programs you will get the difference between while loop and do while loop one different C I'm just taking one variable I am initializing it with the zero now in do while loop I'm writing C out hi Jenny and the condition is while I greater than zero this is the condition right and after after that out of loop so what would be the output of this thing just pause the video and think so what output you will get here there is no condition I would be initialized with 0 then we will enter here then High Jenny would be printed right and e n d l means that would be in cursor will be next line now checking the condition while I greater than 0 is I greater than 0 no I zero condition is not true so exit from the loop and just print out of loop the condition is not true still one time these statement would be executed the body of the loop but same in this case this is y loop I is 0 while I greater than 0 is this condition true no so exit from the loop and it will just print out of loop here you can see the difference I have told you at least once the body of loop would be executed irrespective of the condition into my Loop right and you can also write down this while after this curly braces here while I greater than 0 but the semicolon is must But Here We cannot put any semicolon right now let's see we have seen one program of input validation in last video when we were discussing while loop so let let's write down that program with the help of do while loop you just pause the video and try out that program if you have seen my previous video that input validation I want a number user user to enter a number between one to five right so right on that program we do I'll pause the video and write down so this would be that code using the while loop we can write down some program for input validation we are checking input is valid or not I have declared a number a variable number then do after that here I'm writing enter a number between 1 and 5. so see number and the condition is while number less than equal to 1 or not analogical or number greater than equal to 5 because I want between 1 and 5 not 1 or less than one or not five or greater than 5 right if this is the condition then repeat this thing again Ask from the user enter a number between 1 and 5. if the condition is this condition is true it will repeat if this condition is false if user has entered a number correct number then just print thanks suppose first we will run this and it will ask enter a number between 1 and 5 5 and I have entered 0. right check the condition number less than equal to 1 yes condition is true right condition true means again in the loop again it will ask enter a number between one and five now I am entering six now check the condition number less than equal to one no check second condition number greater than equal to 5 yes condition is true condition true again repeat this Loop again Ask enter a number between one and five now I am entering suppose two check the condition number less than equal to one no or number greater than equal to 5 no this condition is now false so you have entered correct number now out of the loop and it will print thanks one more thing like if you want to calculate area of something area of a square or area of rectangle then one time calculate area of rectangle right again it will ask do you want to calculate another don't to continue if you print yes calculate another area for another rectangle again it will ask yes or no so that thing you can put into while loop so that I will show you with the help of program so I guess now we will see practical we will run these programs on our laptop right and see this number I have declared out of this do I Loop out from this do I look from this body of the loop sorry out of this body of the loop why so because after closing this body we are using this number so we cannot do something like this after do within this we can declare into number not outside it will give error because outside of this body we are using this variable number so we have to declare this outside whatever variable you we will use for the condition you have to declare that variable out of this Loop of the body you have to take care of this thing right now let's do some practical okay let's create a new file for this do while loop do while underscore Loop dot CPP right so now first this header then we use using namespace STD then in Main I'm writing what it should be name space namespace STD then into Main first you will see the difference between while and do while loop so I am taking one variable and I is equal to 0 then that example and then here what condition I need to put I greater than 0 okay and here in code we are just printing C out and we are printing just I Jenny that's it right with the ndl and after this let me just print out of flow just to indicate end of this Loop right then return 0 okay let's run this and I will show you what output will get let me just zoom this I hope now you can see this right now let's run this it will ask so it will not ask anything it will just print high journey and out of loop right the condition is not true but still it is printing higher than you one time right now see I'm just making one difference here I'm just incrementing this value I plus plus within this body of the loop right now what output you will get see one time it will enter High then it will be printed now I plus plus means I becomes 1. now I greater than 0 yes it is true I is 1 again it will print I 2 3 4 so what would be the output is it an infinite Loop or it will end somewhere how many times this higher Jenny would be printed if you have watched my previous video I guess you would be clear how this would run right so this is for your assignment you have to tell me in comment section what would be this output of this thing same if rather than do I Loop if you write down this code with while loop while first the condition then C out higher Jenny then it will print only out of the loop you have to try this at your own now let me just that program we will see see one more program you have to calculate suppose you want to calculate area of a rectangle so what we are taking first variable okay area of rectangle what I want first it will ask enter length and breadth right then it will calculate area it will print this is the area of rectangle right and after that you it will ask you do you want to continue do you want to calculate another if you enter yes again it will ask enter length in breadth if you rather than printing y small or capital Y any other character or one two three or n you will print it will exit from the loop right So within this see you just have to understand this thing rather than writing the program first understand what is the problem statement what would be the output what I want the output according to that you have to write down so at first it will run so at first obviously without checking the condition blue body would execute So within this Loop body what we can what we can take variable I am taking float float length and breadth better to write down length and breadth for better understanding I'm just writing lnv and area is equal to zero I am initializing it with 0 right now what C out it will ask enter length and breadth separated by a space okay now seeing L and B these variables we have taken now calculate area is equal to what length into breadth I guess simple this is the formula or correct me if I am wrong Ln to B after calculating area I am just printing area the area of rectangle you can write down of rectangle or simply you can have an area is and what is that variable area right after that it will ask C out one two calculate another or maybe you can write down do you want to continue so here you can either enter like yes or no you can enter anything but because you will just if yes then it will continue if you know then it will exit from the slope okay and now you will enter this thing yes or no y or n so obviously you have to store that this is input so you have to store that in a variable right so you have to take another variable Choice suppose I am taking choice character choice right so C in in Choice variable I am storing that input right now what we will do now here this condition what you will put see on Choice variable obviously we will put some condition choice would be the yes or no so on that only we will put some condition of choices yes we will continue choices no will not continue that is why on Choice variable we will put condition so that is why this Choice variable I have declared out of this Loop of the body right so now choice is equal to small y or logical or not and choice equal to capital Y is small wire capital Y this is the choice then we will continue right otherwise we will exit from this Loop right simple otherwise out of this loop I hope you got this this uh you know what you can say that logic of calculating area and if you want to continue that thing also how to add this kind of thing because in many programs you will see this thing do you want to continue yes or no or press one for this press 2 for this then do you want to continue at all this kind of problems so we will discuss in next video with the help of the while loop right this is just simple one so let's run this now it will ask enter length and breadth separated by a space so three and four enter the area is 12 okay now it will ask one to calculate another so I am just entering y again it will ask y means yes condition is true so it will continue so I am entering 4 5. 20 again do you want to continue this time I am entering capital Y okay it will ask again so 1 4. area is 4 do you want to continue other than y capital Y and small y you will enter anything suppose I am entering better to enter and means no or if you enter anything right I am entering while sorry not y T then also it will exit C T then out of loop it will exit because the condition is only on y if you will enter Y and Y it will continue other than y if you enter anything 1 2 3 a b c d it will exit okay but you also put this condition also if you enter n Only n for exit or you can say Q for quit if you enter Q then only it will quit from the program if you enter any other thing why you will enter it will continue Q you will enter it will exit other than that you will enter anything it will you know show you invalid choice enter again okay this kind of thing this also you can Implement right these are some you know the this kind of thing you can do with this do I Loop this kind right like this you can write down if you remove this this thing from here it will give you an error right syntax error let me just run this and see at an expected the semicolon before c out so it is giving you an error right so that's it for this video now so I hope you got basics of do I Loop right now in the next video we'll just see two or three more programs on dou y Loop like in which type of different program so different uses of dou by Loop right with the help of program I will show you you can say that video will be more about coding exercise so now I'll see in the next video till then bye take care
