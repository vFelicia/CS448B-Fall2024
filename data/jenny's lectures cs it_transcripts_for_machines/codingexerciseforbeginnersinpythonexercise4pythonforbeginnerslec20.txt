so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed all the operators in Python arithmetic assignment logical bitwise by entity and membership operators right now before moving forward for loops and if else statements let's do one coding exercise right now what is that you have to find out BMI body mass index right and the formula for calculating this BMI is what weight divide by height Square weight divide by height Square now what are the conditions first thing you have to take input using input function right input using input function enter the weight in kilogram enter the height in meters and weight should be of int type and height should be of flow time because weight we can consider like 46 47 48 50 65 like this but height we cannot consider like 1 meter 2 meter three meter four meter because most of the you know these most people lie in that category between one to two meter so I'll take height as float and weight as end right now after calculating I want whole number to print like suppose after calculating like weight is something like 48 or maybe height is something like 1.5 and it it will give some float value right maybe like 21 points like this but I want it should print only 21. int the whole number not 21 point some decimal points no so I hope you got the you know problem statement what I want right so now pause the video and try this out so let's create a new project coding exercise coding exercise four dot py because we have discussed three problems before right and okay now we will take using input function we will take like input and we will write enter weight in kilogram fine next input height in meter so whatever you will enter obviously we have to we will use that after some time right so you have to store into some variable suppose I am taking a variable wait and to store height we'll take a variable height better to take meaningful name rather than wnh or ABC okay now see this okay let's print first print and let's run this wait suppose I am entering 48. height I am entering 1.5 and see it will print 48 okay it is printing it is you know running successfully so okay let's simply take a variable BMI and apply the formula now what is the formula weight divide by height square right height and square means this is the operator in Python double star that means Square power height Square okay fine and let's print BMI let's see it works or not I hope now you can see this okay let's run this weight 48 height 1.5 C the error it's a type error unsupported operand types for this power string and int unsupported operand type so now weight and height the data type of these are string because I have told you whatever you will take using this input function that the data type of that thing would be considered as string if you want to check out you can check out like print and I am checking type of using type function we can check wait okay let's uh comment this out let's run this and the weight is suppose 34 height is suppose 1.1 see class is Str so wait the type or the class of this very string and we want it should be int and for height it should be floored so you have to convert type conversion you need to you know apply hair so let's do that thing also right so for weight I want data type should be int so this is how you can convert that we have discussed in previous videos and for height I won't float so write down something like this height float now weight isn't and height is float right now let's print BMI now run this wait suppose I'm entering 48 again and height is 1.5 C now BMI is 21.3333 something like this we got this thing but one problem is still there I want it should be 20 21 the whole number not in fractional not this fractional part so you have to convert this BMI into int right same type conversion you need to apply so simply what you can do end that's it just convert this BMI into ink okay let's run this weight 48 height 1.5 and now it's fine it is printing 21 right so this is how you here you have applied what concept type conversion plus these operator concept right plus how to take input using input function how to convert these things you have applied so I hope you got how to apply these concept here and how to calculate BMI right now using we can also round this 21 like 21 point five six seven something like this so after decimal if it is 5 for greater than 5 it should print the next number like 21.6 should print 22 so you can round that thing also so that thing we'll discuss in next video how to round the numbers rather than just converting type conversion it that would be better to round to round these numbers right so the next we will see round function plus we will see after F string also right so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
