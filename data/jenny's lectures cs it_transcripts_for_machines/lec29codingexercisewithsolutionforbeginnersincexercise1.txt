so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing loops in c plus plus we have discussed uh till now for loop okay everything about for loop we have discussed so let's see a program it's you can say it's a coding exercise for you guys using for loop now you have to write down a program to find out or to calculate sum of four integers from 1 to 15 and 1 and 15 both are included means inclusive using for loop you have to write down this program okay now let's pause the video we'll see the solution also in this video explain i'll explain the solution step by step but uh first you try out pause the video and try this out so let's create a new file we can say exercise for loop okay dot cpp first thing is you have to include header io stream then using namespace std and then we'll write down main hint main here we will take two variable into i and sum sum i'm going to initialize it with 0 okay why so because if you don't initialize this sum then it will take any garbage value and whenever we will do some of the when you will add in this sum variable then maybe it will give some unexpected results so better to initialize the variables proper initialization now in for loop we have to do we have to iterate the thing this thing from 1 to 15 and from 1 to 15 also we will we have to find out code integers only so you have to put extra condition also so first iterator loop from 1 condition is less than equal to 15 equal to 15 because it is inclusive and then one by one we are going to increment now check the number is odor even because we have to do some of odd numbers only how to find out if you divide a number by two and the remainder is zero then it would be even number if the remainder is not 0 it means it would be odd number so same you can put how to find out remainder using a operator modulo i hope you know the working of model operator if you don't know then i we have discussed about these operators in the previous lecture so you can check out the playlist so if this number i and mode 2 not equal to 0 exclamation mark and equal to this is what not equal to zero if the condition is true this condition is true means the number is ode now do sum so what we will do in sum we will do sum plus i the number you will update the sum as soon as you find out number just add it to the previous sum once you find out whole number again you find out number again add some if the number is even just skip this part and just do i plus plus okay now after this for loop just print sum sum equal to we are going to print in a variable name sum we have so just use that variable to print and successfully the program will be successful then just return 0 okay it means program return 0 means successfully terminated the program okay now i hope you got this now let's run this and see see sum is equal to 64. so you can do sum of 4 integer 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15. these are all integers from 1 to 15 and i just calculate the sum manually you will find out that sum will be 64. i hope you got this logic it's very simple i guess okay so if you don't know this thing the behind the scene what the execution process the step by step then you can continue watching this video if you have got this thing you can just skip the video so in the next part of this video right now you just continue watching this video i'll explain this program step by step okay so let's see the detailed execution of this program step by step whenever you run that program control first of all we'll go to the main function okay now in main function we have two variables i and some so in memory some memory would be allocated to this i and memory would be allocated to sum it is of in types of four bytes four bytes for this four bytes for this now in i we don't have anything in sum we have zero why i have initialized sum that also i'll tell you in i we have nothing now next statement is four i is equal to one now this initialization of i is equal to one now in i we have one check the condition one less than equal to fifteen see it is inclusive so okay one has been included as well as fifteen because the condition is less than equal to fifteen it's not less than fifteen means equal to 15 would also be included condition true okay fine control will enter here now check the condition if this i 1 mode 2 equal not equal to 0 because see if if you divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 0 then that would be even number but we want some of odd integers okay so this this operator modulo will give remainder so if the remainder is not equal to zero this operator is not equal to this exclamation mark and equal to this is not equal to operator okay not equal to zero yeah the remainder would be one only okay it is not equal to zero it means it is odd so now the condition is true so control will enter again into this if statement so by default we have only one statement in if so i am not putting these curly braces if you want to put you can put here curly braces here and here okay now sum equal to sum plus i now sum plus i that would be initial that would be assigned to the sum now sum is equal to sum is 0 and at this point of time i value is 1 so 0 plus 1 is 1 so now 1 would be assigned to this sum now sum becomes 1 okay now i plus plus next task is i plus plus now i becomes 2 condition true again condition would be checked condition true again enter here now 2 mode 2 it would be 0 the condition is not true so will not enter here skip this part and i plus plus now i becomes 3 condition true again enter 3 mode 2 remainder would be 1 so it is not equal to 0 yes condition true means as we know 3 is odd number so we'll enter here now sum plus i sum is equal to 1 and plus i at this point of time i is 3 3 plus 1 is 4 now 4 we would be assigned to the sum now sum becomes 4. now again i plus plus now i becomes 4 condition true yes enter here 4 mode 2 equal to 0 condition is not reduced so we will not enter here control will not enter here skip this part i plus plus now i becomes 5. condition true check the condition 5 less than equal to 15 condition true 5 mode 2 remainder would be 1 not equal to 0 yes condition 2 now some would be done like this i hope now you you can do this so you please try right right on this program at your own till i becomes 15 once i becomes 15 condition is still true i less than equal to 15 yes still true enter here 15 more 2 yes it it will give 1 remainder so condition is 2 it is not equal to 0 again in turn now some would be done at finally some would be 64. now i become 16 now condition is not true 16 less than equal to 15 no now exit from this for loop now out of this four loop what we are printing sum equal to whatever the value of sum now some would be printed that is 64. we have initialized some with zero because if we don't initialize a number that will take any garbage value and suppose it will take it it is taking any garbage value and in garbage value plus at first time i was one garbage value plus one definitely it would be some garbage value so maybe the result would be something different you know different from whatever i have we have expected so better to initialize a variable before using it with some value okay here we have initialized i with one sum with zero fine i hope now you got the working of uh this program this exercise so now in the next video we'll see uh range based for loop or better we will see why loop because for range based for loop we have to you have to you know have some idea about arrays and vectors but i haven't discussed those things so first we will discuss while loop and do while loop then a small distribution discussion would be on arrays and vectors and then we will see that range based for loop so now i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
