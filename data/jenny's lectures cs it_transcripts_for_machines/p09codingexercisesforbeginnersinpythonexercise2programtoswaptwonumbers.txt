so in the series of learning python programming language in the previous video we have discussed variables in python right how to use variables how to declare variables why we need variables what are variables everything with the help of a program and a coding exercise now in this video we will see a program actually or we can see it would be a coding exercise for you guys you have to swap two numbers right so this is the case it should be on your output screen like enter value of a you will enter any value like 1 then interval b 2 after swapping you should print a equal to 2 b equal to 1 thus it should print on the screen so i think you can basically please don't you know search the logic of swapping and all think about us let's take a real life example if you have two glasses in one glass i have suppose milk and in another glass i have tea fine now you have to swap these things these uh coffee and sorry milk and coffee milk and tea so what you can you know what should be the thing what you will you will i know how you will exchange these two things maybe probably we will take third container there you can exchange like milk you can exchange in that thing in milk container now you can put that tea now and from the third container you can put that milk to this t i hope you got this logic in real life how you will do that thing please think about this and same logic you have to apply this swapping of two numbers suppose to swap two numbers you have to take another container or you can say variable that's it so let's try this out pause the video and try this out after that we'll see the solution so let's create a new file here click on new file and swap underscore sorry swap underscore numbers i'm taking this name numbers dot p y it should be dot dot p y not hyphen or anything okay so now we'll take input and enter value of a that should be printed printed on the screen right so whatever you will enter that we are going to store in a variable obviously so that we can use in future so in a i am using i am storing that now in b what we do again input function and here i am writing enter value of b okay so now a and b now we have to swap these numbers so one hint i have given you that we have to take another variable for this thing suppose i am taking another variable temp or any variable name you can take so in temp first of all i am storing a value of a okay now in a i'm storing value of b and in b i'm storing value of temp fine i hope you got this logic if you got the real life example now simply we have done the swapping now simply you have to print so print we will print a equal to this string should be printed on the screen a equal to and now value of a now value of a is in k this a variable so simply we cannot write down a no in python we cannot do this thing it will give error see it is giving an error suppose i run this program and what is your name sorry it is actually running another program let's just right click this and swap run swap numbers see it is giving syntax error invalid syntax perhaps you forgot comma so here in print a equal to this this thing in line number seven it is syntax error you cannot write down this in this python here i'm just concatenating using plus i'm concatenating these two strings so you can use comma also next print uh b is equal to plus and whatever the value in b that i'm writing okay so i'm concatenating these things so rather than this you can use formula also rather than plus let's run this and see what output you will get so interval of a 1 b 2 see after swapping it is printing a is equal to 2 and b is equal to 1 we have swapped these things same one concept i want to tell you this is a string because it is in these codes plus plus is used to concatenate strings a a is what you will say a is what a number integer a is 1 or after swapping is 2 so how can you concatenate these two things string with an integer same explanation is what i hope you got the answer if you got just let me know in comment section if you haven't got this thing let me just tell you input function we are taking this a from this input function input function so input function by default we will return string so whatever you will enter whether it's an integer for you one two three four five it would be considered as a string this b value doth because would also be considered as a string so now a is also string the value is also string by default so string plus string we can concatenate these two things okay and rather than this plus you can use comma also i hope you got this exercise or if you haven't got let me just tell you the explanation part so you can continue watching this video if you haven't got the explanation part of this thing so let's see the explanation step by step first thing okay this will be executed input enter value of a we have a variable a in memory some memory would be allocated to this a whatever you will enter one i have entered that will be stored here now another variable is b we have entered two two will be stored here now we have taken another variable temp so we have one more variable temp or you can say third container we have in temp i am assigning a value a value is 1 so in temp now we have 1 now in a i am assigning b value so whatever b 2 that would be assigned to a now this becomes 2. now in b we are assigning temp value now in b we are assigning temp value in temp we have 1 so now 1 would be assigned to this b you can see now you can print now a that will be printed 2 and in b now we have 1 so this was simple logic okay as these are variables so you can we can these very values can be valid we can change the values that's why it we are able to change the values of a and b and temp because these are variables these are not constraints fine so i guess that's it for this video this was very simple i guess you got it now the next video will see you know some rules there are some rules to name variables so those things will see in the next video now see the next video till then bye take care
