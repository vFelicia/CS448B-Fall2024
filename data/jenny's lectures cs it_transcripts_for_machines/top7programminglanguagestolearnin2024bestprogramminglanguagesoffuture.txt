hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in this video we'll be discussing top seven programming languages to learn in 2024 or we can say top seven programming languages to learn for future the programming languages which are having great scope in future right if you're are a beginner or if you have some knowledge of like you know coding and still you are confused like which programming languages you should learn first or your are second programming language or third programming language then this video is definitely for you because in this video we'll be discussing all these things the one by one number one programming language second third like this and uh drawbacks and you can say benefits or advantages of learning each and every programming language and the application of each language in which field these programming language are being used all these things we'll be discussing in this video right one by one but before that just want to tell you one thing if you are a gate aspir if you are preparing for gate 2025 then gfg Geeks for geeks is going to start batches for gate preparation interactive live and selfbased courses for gate preparation for computer science for uh uh you know gate data science and artificial intelligence let me just show you don't worry the link I'll put in the description box of this video Once you click on that link you'll be redirected to this page and here you can see the gate courses right for 2025 gate data science and artificial intelligence computer science and information technology and this one is classroom program I mean offline program right so let me just uh explore this one for you here you will get recorded lectures live lectures as well if you miss any live class you can just you know watch the recorded lectures previous your question paper mock test notes uh doubt uh resolution sessions and many more so basically uh this course covers like strategies tips and tricks problem solving core concept building and they are going to to cover the entire gate labus this has been curated by their experts the course content you can uh you can uh check out here for this data science and artificial intelligence this one is computer science and information technology right you can explore this you can register from here like register now and you just have to like they're going to this this batch is going to start from 30th of March Right Live batch and selfbased batch is from for March right so you have to log to continue for you know continue here to register here right so for this also you have like self paced batch and live batch in which batch you want to enroll you can enroll right and this one is their classroom program for gate 2025 like offline program so uh their location is NOA gfg headquarters you have to go there and this batch is also going to start from 30th of March right and for this offline batch they're going to offer a separate batch for da data science and artificial intelligence and computer science so separately you have to enroll for both the uh batches right you can just see here the course coverage for computer science and information technology here what they are going to cover and for data science and artificial intelligence right and for offline batches you can see the upcoming batches here for computer science and it they me your Mentor starting and starting date and timing Saturday Sunday 830 a.m. and uh for this for da data science and artificial intelligence starting date is same 30th of March and timing is this one 330 Saturday Sunday right the fee you can see here and if you have more question you can go to their FAQ section hopefully you'll get your answer here so for any batch if you want to check out like the date and the timing you can just go to the explore on that for and just scroll down and here you will get the upcoming batches detail starting from the timing day Saturday Sunday uh da selfbased courses from 4 March the timing is this one Monday to Friday log to register here so the relevant link and all the details I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and register from there because it's better to start early right so now back to the topic so the first language I would recommend is go for python because it is very easy language to learn syntax is very simple you will feel like you are writing in English simple English language so if you are a beginner you don't know anything about coding you can go for Python language and it would be easy for you guys to learn this language right and it has gained so much popularity in recent year year and it is still gaining popularity right and especially if you are interested in those artificial intelligence machine learning field data science field automation then definitely this is your language this is the only language you should go for right and these are obviously trending field the future of technology machine learning data science AI right so if you are interested in this field definitely pick Python language right there are so many libraries here numai pandas for dealing with large set of data tensor flow skyfi many uh libraries are there you know which are going to allow you to work in these uh Fields researchers favorite language is python right and many big tech companies are using this language like Google Netflix Amazon for automation for data science for you know handling large set of data for artificial intelligence and a lot of documentation and many tutorials are available many courses are available so you can easily learn this language and it can be used in backend development also through Jango flas through these Frameworks now the second one is Javascript 98% web is using JavaScript nowadays right so it is everywhere and it is skill scaling it's like it has dominated the web development field JavaScript language so if you are a beginner and if you are interested in web development like designing websites even for front end development full stack development even back end development go for JavaScript right this should be your first language to pick up right and it it is having you know a great scope in future right beginner friendly language not so tough to learn right can be used both in front endend and back end right you know reactjs so much popular right so these are angular reactjs the these are based on JavaScript right through nodejs you can use this JavaScript for backend development and many big tech companies like even Facebook Google are using this language so if you are a beginner and if you are interested in web development even front end development back end development or full development go for JavaScript and if you are you are interested in those like data science machine learning ai go for python right both are easy to learn beginner friendly but it depends in which field you are interested according to that you have to pick your choice both are having great scoping future right third one is Java Java is yeah it's very old but it is still po very popular language still Enterprise favorite language still Java is a goto language for companies to pick up like while you know uh developing a Enterprise apps Enterprise app means like these are like you can say consider these as normal apps but these are specifically built for that this that particular business that particular Enterprise so for that Java is goto language the most popular language to learn still there are many job openings still you know and for experienced Java developers the salary uh is you know here the salary package is much more and many openings are there and still in future is in future also this is having a great scope right and one drawback of this is it is little bit tough yeah it is tough compared to Python and JavaScript but the plus point is what if you go for Java right and after that if you learn any other programming language then it would be easy for you guys to pick up that other programming language right so that is a plus point but yeah for beginner it is a little bit tough to learn Java but definitely if you are interested you can pick this language as your first programming language right next I would recommend go for go or go L it is emerging language it is gaining popularity and definitely it is having a great scope in future go language it is designed by Google and definitely better than C and C++ right and it is going to you know focus more on backend development right so it is being designed for backend development backend services to provide backend services for cloud computing like cloud services infrastructure Services these kind of things yeah it is having limited library and limited Community but still it is emerging right and it is having a great scope and it is techically type language and it is highly performance language right simple and readable sentex but there are if you want to go in deep then definitely you have to learn those high level uh you know concept like concurrency threading these are little bit tough right but so you can choose this as your second language right not first language if you are a beginner first go for either python or JavaScript right these are easy to learn then go for as a second language you can uh choose goang right next for mobile lab development either cin or Swift right cotan is gaining popularity see uh ping is used for Android development right and Swift is used for IOS app development right so it depends in which field you are interested for in iOS or C sorry in iOS or Android right uh before Java was Java language was used for uh app development for Android development but later in 201 2017 Google announced the scotlink as their official language for Android development right and then it is gaining popularity and it will it is having a great scope in future also and if you want to be an iOS Developer you want to develop iOS apps for like maybe for Apple watch or Mac or iOS phone Apple phone then go for Swift it is also not so much difficult and iOS developers are also having a good salary package next rust it is like new C it is gaining popularity uh basically used in system programming for Designing operating system C was used first but the big tech companies and those are you know switching to rust for uh system programming right for system designing for operating system so uh it is also a language of future rust you can learn this this also but you choose this language as your maybe second or maybe third programming language right because yeah it is difficult to learn a little bit but it is secure and reliable and it has gained so much popularity in recent years so you definitely you can go for rust next last but not the least is SQL structured query language it is the topmost database used simple query you can write but yeah you can write down more advanced and complex query as well but definitely you you should go for SQL also right if you want to deal with database because it is the top most so say the one of the most popular database used so that's it from my side if you think that there should be another language in this list then you can just write down in that comment section right so now I'll see you in the next then byebye take care
