hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning pathway programming language in the previous video we have seen debugging tips right with the help of some programs or we can say examples right now in this video we'll be working on more project that is a game higher lower game okay let me just show you first what is this game and how to play this game we'll play this online so whenever you go to Google and you will search higher lower game then you can click on this first link and this is the game just click on classic and C2 option you will get one versus second now this is having first option is having these many searches average monthly search right now you have to yes the second option has higher or lower search than the first one I don't know maybe higher so let's click on higher I'm right and see now your score is one now the second option would be now at First Option versus now again we get second option and you have to guess again I'm right my score is 2 then this versus a new Option you will get thank everyone I don't know maybe lower I'm right so see my score is now 3. whenever you like give the right answer the score would be plus one right like this now I'm wrong that's it my score is 4. so the average score is 3.2 and like your average it will give you some feedback and if you want to play again you can play again so this is the game right you got it right now let's play this game and I just show you the output after implementing the game whenever you click on run then what kind of output it will show you right let's see so first it will show the logo of the project like higher lower the game then to option compare one one option like NASA space agency from us and compared to T Series from India who has more followers type one or two so I'm assuming like on Instagram who is having more followers in millions right so two let's run this and your right your score is one now T Series versus second option is Narendra Modi so more followers second you are wrong your Finance score is one right and yeah we are using that clear screen option also like previous result has also been cleared everything is C cleared and we are also seeing the logo every time and the final is you are wrong your final score is one and whatever the options before this everything is cleared right so this is the thing you need to do you have to implement this kind of thing let me just run this again so let's enter one your right your score is one and see previous one it's cleared now only we are seeing the uh the logo of the game right then your writer score is one then compare one then two choices now I'll just enter like two again your write your score is two then Jennifer Lopez Shakira and let's do this time you are wrong and your final score is two only right so you have to implement this kind of thing right okay now you pause the video and you can just try this out where the database you have just you have to create your database from where these options are generating like compare one compared to like this from where you are getting these options Justin Bieber a musician from Canada NASA space agency from us from where so you for that you have you should have a database right so I am having a database let me just show you so this is what I'm having I'm having a list name of the list is data and there I'm having dictionaries right name like Jenny's lectures follower count in millions like one million description is a YouTuber then country India then second in second dictionary I am having all the detail for second candidate like second person like Ronaldo follower count in millions description and Country like this I am having this database right so like this first create your own database based on this a list having multiple dictionaries and each dictionary is having like data of one person everything name the follower account description and Country like this right and from here obviously randomly two options would be generated two name would be generated right so in a list we know randomly if you want to generate anything we have an option choice and you can import random module in random module we have a function choice that will randomly generate any person or any you know member from this list like this you need to generate two member and then comparison is based on follower count you have to compare follow account of one person and second person right based on that if you are right score would be plus one if you are wrong then exit the game and it will show your final score right so first create this database this kind of database at first you can have only three four or five name only right and second what I have that Arc like in game art I am having two variables game logo is equal to the sort higher lower and one art is for versus this how to generate this ad on Google you just have to search text to a sky art and on any link you can click here and when you type something like higher lower then the sky art would be generated and you can copy this art and you can paste this thing here in a variable but three quotation mark within these three quotation mark make sure right same for verses you can generate from here like verses and this would be versus or you can change the font from here what you want which kind of font you want right you can just copy paste this the second variable versus within these three quotation mark that's it so two file already we have game art Dot py and game database.py so first create these two file and then start writing code right first divide this problem in simple problems small small problem so you can create a flowchart then one by one try to solve these small small problems right first what you need to do second third fourth like first you need to you know display this art right so that is very simple one how to display then do that thing then you have to generate two random account from the list how to generate you know we have a random module there we have a function choice and like this you can generate right now you have to display that information in a particular format see I have shown you like this you have to display the information compare one first then the name of the person then the description a musician and then from country like this in this format you have to display so now you have to format the information of that account right and then on follower count number of followers on that value you have to compare these two things right so now like this divide the problem into small pieces and then try this so pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have done this so see it will take at least one hour right so if you haven't tried this out please pause the video and try this out give it at least one hour then come again for the solution so let's create a file higher lower game.py first thing what you need to do you have to display that at higher lower first right so that we are having us in a second another file so what we can do we can import that file the name of that file is game art right and from that game art if you write like print how to access first see how to use some if you want to use that function Choice from random module then name of the module random door choice so here name of this file game art Dot uh the what we can say the variable name the variable name is game logo right so same you need to write down Dot game logo right so if you run this sorry let's select here from you know current file and now let's run this see it will show higher lower so one small task is complete now what you need to do randomly from the database so first obviously you have to import that file also game database so from game database from this list from this list data you have to fetch two random account right so how to fetch let's suppose account 1 equal to any random So Random dot we have Choice sort of automatically c will get here this random module has been imported So Random dot choice and here you have to pass the name of the list data but directly we cannot pass like data if I run this it will give error see the name data is not defined so what you need to do data is from which module you need to specify the name this is the idea of like namespaces so it is from game database maybe this data variable may be present in both in you know game art as well as in game database so from which file you need to access this data right like if two person are having same name like jayanti jayanti so in in a class how you will identify have your teacher identify you from your surname right like this so same for account two now if you know need to if you want to print what is account one and account two so simply what we can do we can just print account one and account two so this is what you can say we are just checking whether we are having some error or not so it's working fine account one is this account who is this but I don't want to display this information like this you know the format compare one then name of the person like NASA then description space agency or space agency then from United States like this you have to format this thing I don't want this complete thing I don't want like to show this follower okay now this thing how you can do c so just delete those print statement and what you need to do now we have to fetch three things name description and country see this name Jenny's lectures like description YouTuber and country India so these three values you need to fetch from this from the dictionary so how to fetch the values you have to pass the key as it is right okay now for account one I'm fetching let's take a variable name name have to fetch from account one you need to fetch account one is what obviously the the information is in form of dictionary so how to fetch these brackets and as it is key you need to pass so key is what name string so in string format you are passing this second one is description so same like account one for account one I'm fetching first name of the key as it is see name of the key as it is description and same you can fetch country right and now print the these things so using F string we are printing first the name so in the name variable I am having name then comma then what is description then comma from and what is the country like this so let's run this C higher lower Taylor Swift a musician from us so yeah we got this to some extent but you have to modify more same for second account you need to fetch so same line you need to write down for second account right so what we can do if you are same you know same line you are repeating again and again the same code then you can just put those statements those lines in a function and whenever you need those line you can just call that function that is the advantage of using function so we should use that thing right so let's write down these lines in a function let's define a function there and like display account info and obviously it will accept account as a parameter right so we are defining this function here and after fetching the value account One account two then we are calling this function display account info right and we are passing first account one and next time again because for both the account we need formatting account to account One account two right so now rather than account one here we have a parameter account parameter name so you need to replace this with account right now no need to write down C these four lines again you just have written only one line this for account 2 and it will call this function so it will reduce the number of lines let's run this see Shakira Chopra two account we got two account and the same format we want right for both the accounts but now compare one compared to this thing is also important right so rather than printing here let's return this thing because in I also want to you know print compare one compared to like this right so obviously I cannot write down here print compare I compare one compared to how will you do it compare one compared to so let's return this thing and here in which format you want to display print F string first try down compare one and this and now the information right now the information so now we can do we can do one thing we can call this function here in these braces because we are using F string so whatever account information would be there that would be displayed and first compare one would be written same for account 2. and just pass here account 2 right rather than simply calling this function like this right let's run this now I will show you see compare one the information compared to the information but between these we need we need to print verses right so between these we need to print what that versus that are so from game art you just have to fetch the variable name versus C the name of the variable is this versus right or you can take any variable name so now it will show C logo compare Oneness versus compare to now decoration is almost complete now it will ask who has more followers type 1 or type 2. this input you need to take so how to take this input using input function same line who has more forward type 1 or 2 but whatever you will enter one or two that is now spring obviously that is string 102 sorry InDesign so you need to type cast this into integer because whatever you will take input from console using input function that would be a string but I want integer 102 so convert this into in and where to store in a variable guess okay now let's run this again see till now it's fine higher lower name compare one this compared to this and who has more follower type 1 and 2 right but see if I entered 1 then simply exit because main thing is still remaining the logic now we have to compare these account based on what based on this value follow our count based on follower count so first you need to fetch the value this value from dictionary whatever account has been generated randomly for those account you have to fetch this follower count how to fetch that you know how to fetch so first fetch follower follower count for first how to fetch just name of that account right in which we are having in this variable account one and this is the dictionary so name of the key as it is follow or underscore count yeah follower it's underscore count right same for second the variable name I'm taking full overcome to then account from account 2 and follower count right so if you need to check like you have successfully fetched these two follower count values or not then simply we can use we can print and let's run this see who has more more follower first enter and then it will fetch see the party is having 5 million follower and messy for 80 million so yeah it's working fine it is fetching the follow account now you have to apply the logic you have to compare based on follow account now we are having four choices see so this like this we are having four choices first thing is the account one is having less followers than second so here now I am having two cases this is what guess now I have guessed account one right so if one is having less followers than two and you have guessed one then obviously it is wrong and if you have guessed two then it is you are right now second is account one is having more followers than account two and the guess is one I have guessed one so definitely this is correct but this is wrong so these four option you need to put in if else condition right so now let's put this like this so we will be creating a function check answer and there what you need to pass your guess then follower count to 1 as well as follow account two these three things right so let's define this function here you need three parameter to accept these three arguments so first is guess follower one follower two same name you can take or different name you can take it's up to you so one I'm taking same name like yes and for these two I'm taking different names right now put some condition if if first condition I am putting follower one suppose less than follower two follower one less than follower two so now within this we are having two options the guess is one or guess is two So within this one more if gas equal to equal to 1. if guess is one then you are wrong right so we are returning simply false right else second option return because else guess is 2 and it's true now for this now one if is complete within this if we are using IF else right now for this if we have one else no need to put the condition this thing like follower one are greater than 4 over 2 because if this is not true then definitely second thing is true so else now put these two conditions if guess is one then return true if guess is not 1 it's 2 then return fourths so if your guess is 1 this time return else return Focus right so this is the logic I hope this is not so much tough and you just you if you go to this table then I guess you can simply map that table in this if else statement if else condition and there can be multiple ways to write down to map this table into here even in less number of lines you can write down this code rather than this it fails just one line return guess equal to equal to 1. sorry guess equal to equal to not one it's two so here after returning guess if guess is 1 1 equal to equal to 2 no so it will run false and that's exactly we want it guess is one it should return false so if guess is two then two equal to equal to 2 is true so it will turn true that's exactly the one so rather than this completely fail so you can write down this line also I hope you got the working of this and rather than this if else you can just return else return guess equal to equal to 1 right so whatever it is going to return to your poles we are going to accept that thing that answer here in a variable this underscore correct right now you need to check if the answer is correct then score should be plus 1. if the answer is wrong then just simply print you are wrong and it will print the final score this thing is remaining only right so let's check if this is correct equal to equal to true means you are right true then what we can do your score is but I'm not having any variable I am not you know tracking the score anywhere right so what we can do we can just have a variable first score is equal to 0. right and there if it is true then what do we do first score plus equal to 1 or you can say score is equal to score plus one it will be increased and then your right and your score is from the variable score we can just print right okay else or rather than this you can simply write is correct you can Commit This thing because that is also fine if true then obviously you will enter here else you're wrong and your final score is this right okay let's run this we have an invalid syntax else line number 22 okay it's else and here indent let's run this compare one compare two who has more follower obviously Kylie Jenner is having more follower than NASA so one it is printing the follower count 400 for Kylie Jenner and 94 for NASA your right verse 4 is 1. but now exit but I don't want to exit I want to repeat this game again if I am right so that functionality is still remaining you have to means like if you are right then again it should create to account like this these random account then again display the information then you it will again ask who has more follower and these lines should be repeated again and again right from here so these lines everything you need to put in a loop which Loop the batter is while looping because we don't know the number of iteration exactly how many times you need to repeat these line so put this in while loop what how to put the condition is what so I am taking suppose a a variable continue flag and I am setting this to True at first so while continue flag and everything would be indented tab right while true it is true obviously while true will enter here now exit condition when to exit from this Loop if you are wrong in that case you have to exit so here you have to exit from this Loop so what you can do have to exit just flip this flag variable to phones right and that's it okay let's run this see first Taylor Swift and Ronaldo what do you think it's two yeah your right and your score is one because Ronaldo is having 600 and this 267 right your score is one now see compare one Kylie Jenner and fit tuber let's run this it's one your write your score is 2 then again compare Beyonce and Taylor Swift but one thing in that game whenever you are right then this second account would be switched to First account would become the first account and then second account would be generated again I hope you remember this thing when you have played that game right that account two that option two was second time the option one and at at the place of option two now you are having a new option and again if you are right then option two again will become option one and then add option two you are having a new name right so this thing you haven't implemented yet because every time it is creating two random account it is not shifting this so what I want is like this compare one Beyonce and Taylor Swift so if I enter two see you are wrong and your final score is 2 but if like this in this case I am right Swift and Ronaldo in this case to Ronaldo I was right so next time this Christian this Ronaldo would be account one and at account two a random account would be generated like this right so this still you need to implement so what we can do if you are right then again go to while loop and here this account to should become account one and account two then account 2 will be generated again this kind of thing we want but this will give error see account who is not defined because we are using here account to and before that we have we haven't defined account two after this we have a defined account so one solution for this is here before while loop we can do one thing account to so first generate any account that would be account to right and then at first first time we are running then account 2 would be account one and then account two would be generated again right but the problem is placed on this C first Kylie Jenner neeraj Chopra it would be second okay no it's one I'm wrong let's run this again NASA and Jenny's lectures obviously NASA is having higher than me higher follower so see you are right your score is one now see you got this at compare one now this account 2 at previous this was account two and now it becomes the new account one now account one is Jenny's lectures and account two is suitable right obviously fit tuber is having more follower on YouTube then again your right your score is 2 and C now compare one first account become fit tuber and second account is any random account Shakira like this I want so that is fine but one problem is if both the account sometimes are same in that case what will happen so that can be a bug right till now maybe you are thinking it's fine it's working fine but maybe sometime both accounts are same then what you will do so you have to that situation also So within this while loop we can check like if we check like if account one equal to equal to account two then this account 2 would be generated again but if again second time also same then what you will do so you have to put not if but put a while loop while account one equal to equal to account two till then again generate account to so if again account 2 is same then again generate a next account like this right so this is how you can handle the situation let's run this now one more thing is remaining uh the previous screen you have to clear the previous output if you are right then previous output should be cleared and again two comparison would be there right to account so for that that thing we have discussed many times you have to import see there are many options as well because I'm just telling you this this one you can import OS this thing this module and where you want to clear the screen when after after just delete these line because I don't want to print the number of followers before printing you are right your score is this you have to remove the previous thing right so before this if we can just call this OS Dot system this and we can just pass a command CLS you are working on Windows and CLS otherwise in Linux just pass clear clar right and one more thing you need to do for this you have to right click on this file you have to modify the Run configuration and there you have to tick this option emulate terminal in output console you have to take this thing and apply then okay now how you can have you how you should run not from here right click here and run file in Python console here see higher lower compare one Narendra Modi Virat Kohli so obviously two Virat Kohli was having higher follower so two so your right your score is one then compare one now second at previous was second account was Virat Kohli now account one is Virat Kohli and a new account we have fit tuber you have to compare these two who has more followers obviously Virat Kohli so it's one again your writer score is 2 and see previous output has been cleared previously the screen has been cleared but I want that that higher lower that logo should be there every time right but see it has cleared that logo as well so if I write two you are wrong your final score is two it should show the logos so where again you have to print the logo see after clearing this screen again I want to print game art Dot game logo right okay let's run this now run file in Python console Selena Gomez T Series then one yes your write your score is one see now previous we have only this logo higher lower previous has been cleared up your screen your write your score is one now T Series versus Ronaldo two your write your score is two now Ronaldo versus Selena and I am just entering one so again your write your score is three then your writer score is 4 and now this time you are wrong your final score is this like this so I hope this is not so much tough you have done this with me right and you got this one by one every line if not then you can just take a break you can write down this thing same same you know method you have to follow in a piece of paper dry around this one by one line by line and you will get it right so on the next video we'll see one more project so now which is the next two reason bye take care
