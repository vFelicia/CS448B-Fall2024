so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing file handling concepts in c in the previous video we have discussed append mode in c basically we have discussed three modes read write and append mode now we are left with three more modes r plus w plus and a plus these are special modes right so in this video we'll see what is r plus mode with the help of a proper program and i'll show you practical also in my laptop right now before i just want to tell you one thing if you guys are going to start for preparing gate 2023 and 2024 exam then an academy is going to start new batches

on an academy plus subscription so all the relevant links and the details i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is r plus mode i hope you remember what is r mode read mode means you are going to open the file in read model you can read the content of that file right if file don't exist it is it will give error means it will return null only right it is not going to create a new file like in w mode in w mode this is right mode here if file don't exist it will create a new file and it will open this file but in r mode if i already exist it will open the file for reading only you cannot write into that file but if i don't exist it will give error it is not going to create a new file right now what is r plus mode this for both reading and writing it will open the file for both reading and writing you can read as well as you can write but main purpose of our plus mode is reading right here if file exists okay it will open the file both for reading and writing but if i don't exist it is not going to create a new file right this you need to take care so now let us say i take one example i have a file suppose abc dot txt in my hard disk i want to read the content of this file right now first of all obviously you will create a file pointer and starting i am going to initialize with it with null so using f open function we will open the file just provide the name of the file abc dot txt and the mode is r plus in double quotes right now you have to check if because if something f open is not going to you know f open is not able to open this file it will return null so if f p is equal to is equal to null means in printf you can simply print error or anything you can print and you can simply exit from here only so now if you if suppose in my file i have this content hi this is the content i have in my file so if you will read this so now this file has been opened you can read this and you can write also main purpose is to read right now you can read how you can read the the function i have already told you how you can read this file using the function f get s f get c right f get s means complete string you can read just provide what string in which you all you will store and the string length here n and here just provide the file pointer f get c means it will read only a single character by character right we have discussed both these functions in the previous videos right how you can read something from a file in that video so you can check out that video now if you will write something something to this file where you can write means see in append mode you can append at the last if you will open the file in write mode means the previous content would be erased and simply you can write from here only but if you will open the file in read mode so r plus mode then where you can write this is very important about this mode right r plus mode this point makes this mode special you can write anywhere from starting from any in middle or at the end just you have to set your file pointer the logic you have to write and you can write down anywhere if you will open the file in r plus mode means basically if there is something in your file and you want to modify you don't want to add a new content right you don't want to append but you want to modify the already existed content from that file right suppose few lines are there ten lines and two or three lines you want to modify in that case open the file in r plus mode you can modify the file using this r plus mode only no other mode will help you to modify the file right so for modifying the file just open the file in r plus mode so this is very special right so just move your file pointer according to that and you can modify right now simply suppose this is my file and i want to put something here a character i want to put f would see and here is the character z in which file just provide the file pointer and that's it so where this z would be written here at the place of h in the starting cursor would be here only so h would not be there and here you can add z the remaining content would be same if suppose i want to add f put again f put as a string like i want to add jenny and fb and after that f close so first the file was high this is awesome so first of all this at the place of this z then jenny so here we have j e double n and y and remaining content would be same so this is what you have modified the this content if you want to modify the content from here just move the file pointer according to that you just have to specify the logic that also will discuss with help of program right in separate video but you can modify your content right if you want to add in the last that also you can do but by default if you write this thing this would be added from here only or this content would be you know updated or modified right if you want to read simply you can read with these functions right the reading logic i have already discussed i hope you can write that logic so the main point about r plus mode is it will open the file for both reading and writing if file don't exist it will not create a new file just give error or you know return the null pointer right and it is used to modify the content of your file right you can move the file pointer where you want to modify which content you want to modify that's it let me show you practical so now let me create a new file here we'll write down our plus mode dot c and i'm just going to copy the previous because this content would be same till this right we have created a file pointer and suppose you don't want this so just comment it out if open abc dot txt just change the mode not a mode we are going to open the file into our plus mode if fp is null just print error and exit now if fp is not null in that case what will happen see ah let me just first of all write down the string f close and that's it so abc dot txt file suppose i am writing here a b dot txt so this file is not there in my pc only the file is abc.txt in that directory right so if this is not the file then what will be the case see let me just run this and show you what output you will get see it is printing error because there is no such file so it will return uh null f open is not going to open the a b dot text file because it don't it doesn't exist so it will later null and if null just print error right but here i am writing abc dot txt right and in abc dot txt i have suppose the content is this is awesome right now let me just open this file and see what output you will get see if you'll open the file okay fine it will open the file but nothing would be there means no output because you are not uh you know reading something from the file so it is not giving it will not give you error like it will not print any error this message right but it will not show you any output so here and the file content would be same this is awesome so now if you want to add something if you want to write suppose i am writing here f put s and i am writing jenny if we just provide the file pointer that's it now let me run this and show you the file it will not show on the screen anything it has successfully run but in the file now you will get jenny and is awesome so this phis this has been updated by this jenny so the cursor would be at the starting at the first byte or the first character right and whatever you will write that would be written from the starting of the file only right and remaining content would be same so jenny is awesome right now suppose uh one more thing f put c i want to add a character also like uh z sorry character would be in single quotes right uh z fb now let me just run this and show you now see in the file we have jenny then z i has been replaced by z and s and then awesome right so i hope you go to what is r plus mode now whenever wherever you want to modify the content if suppose you have a lengthy file five or ten lines or many lines and specific line you want to modify just move the cursor just move the file pointer to that uh you know place and modify that line only right so if you want to modify the already existing content already existed content then you will open the file in r plus mode then it will be beneficial right otherwise reading and writing both wps can also do reading and writing a plus can also do reading and pending writing right but that is the difference only this mode will modify if you want to modify you are supposed to open the file in r plus mode only right and if you want to read the content whatever the content in the file just put the logic of reading the file that i have already discussed in my previous videos so you can check out that and you can put that content so that is assignment for you guys right you will read also and you will write also something right and you will open the file in r plus mode fine so now i guess that's it for this video so i hope you go to this r plus mode in the next video we will see w plus mode and also we will see the difference between r plus and w plus mode right so now in the next video till then bye take
