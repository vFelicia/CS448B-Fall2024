right and we are implementing these exercises on the box wall One X here you know that's a this is a website to Learn Python for beginners actually right now in this video we'll be discussing one more exercise right same the hurdle race but this is going to be something different here we are going to use while loop in the previous video we have seen that exercise we have sold that thing using for Loop so I recommend to watch out that video first because that would be really beneficial for you guys you know if you are going to solve this exercise right now let me just show you okay so you have to search hurdle race in revokes world and you can click on the first link and now here see okay hurdle race now it is some hint like what you need to know the function moved on left we have already used in the previous video now you have to be aware about because in this video we'll be using these conditions like front is clear wall in front at goal these functions right and we'll use a while loop and if statement so these are some hint and see in hurdle here you have to select huddle three right it is already selected in my case hurdle three right now what is the case see this is the program we have written in the previous case right using for Loop now this is going not going to work in this video because what is the scene here see if you run this code with this hurdle race then C I hit a wall because at Jump function first of all we are going to move but here we cannot move because we have Wall in front of us right now we have all we cannot move even even one step so you have to turn left and move in upward direction right so this is not going to work this is for sure right but the problem one more problem is what C now hurdle this these hurdles are changing whenever you will reload this game c now at this point of time we have hurdles four hurdles here and four hurdles here right if you again like if I run this and if I again reload this game then now three hurdles are here then one then two so every time you are going to reload the game then these hurdles would be changing so we don't know where the hurdle would be in the next at next time right and how many iteration you need how many jump or how many jump you need how many iteration you need because in the previous case we were sure like six iteration we need six jump that's it we have used four Loop so that is why when you don't know how many jump you need how many iteration you need of this function jump function or you can say walk function this function then we know yeah while loop right let's see if I run this then it will give error and again if I reload this game if I press this back button then see now hurdles one two three only four hurdles are there so these are changing every time so we don't know how many time we have to jump the wall right that is why one hint is what while loop we use if statement we use and you have to use some condition like you have to check like wall in front or not maybe front is clear or not or at goal you are at goal or not right or maybe negation of these functions right so these are some hint now pause the video and try this out be honest don't look the solution pause the video and try this out right okay I hope now you have done this now see we cannot use this for Loop right now obviously turn right function will be using here this jump function also will be using here but there is some you know slight difference in this jump function that also I will show you what is the difference but here we'll be using while loop now in while loop here we put some condition this now the the statement within this while loop would be executed until this condition is true so we know we have here a function it will inbuilt at goal while but not we cannot write while at Gold we have to write y not at goal right sorry it's g o a l right while not at goal this is inbuilt so it's good for us otherwise we can take a variable just like game or variable in previous one of my previous videos we have also seen Game Over set the game over to false then while not game over and then within this while loop you have to flip that variable right to exit from this while loop something like this but we have here at goal function so directly we can use that thing like this is simple for us so why not at Gold we have to now directly we cannot like write down jump no now check we have to check you have to put some if condition if wall is in front like here we don't have Wall in front so we can directly move so maybe you can say like move you can directly right here move move and then we can check if wall in front then jump you have to jump on that wall right but maybe sometime if next time like if next time I reload the scheme then okay we don't have all at this time also in front because we can move one step but suppose next time I reload this game now the see now this point of time we cannot even move a single step because wall is there so we cannot write down move first of all so first check if this function we can use directly like from this this thing if wall in front if this is the case then if all in front then jump just call the function jump this function we have U used and described in the previous video right but you have to modify this function see if wall in front then call jump function so control would be here right okay let's first of all write down one more else in else simply move that's it if wall is in front so you have to jump else move very simple okay now let's run this maybe you think it will work let's run this step by step this step through option first control would be here while not at goal this condition is true we are not at a goal because goal is here let's click this again now if wall in front this would be checked let's run this sorry step then jump so control would be here where we have defined the function jump so in Jump first statement we have move so let's click here and see ouch I hit a wall because we cannot move even as one even single step because the wall is there in front of us so you have to turn what you have to turn left and then move so we will be just stop this game and just modify this function rather than move now that's fine obviously if wall is in front so we cannot move right so jump function you have to modify that you have to write down here turn left remove the smooth and turn left then then move then turn right move down right move and then turn left now this is the jump function here for this program right okay now now it will work fine now let's do this step through while not at goal if wall in front right now wall is not in front because we have reloaded this game so it will be moving to the else part so move again check while not at goal move now all in front yes now jump so to the jump function turn left move turn right then turn right function would be cold because we have defined this function like this right so see this turn left again while not at goal yes wall in front yes jump go to jump function turn left move turn right now hold on right function right function simple then again turn right then move then turn left now I hope now you can easily do this okay now see turn left then move turn left now check the condition now we added to Gold so check the condition the condition is not true exit from the program exit from this Loop now see you will see this this is at correct position X and Y position right I hope you got this if you stop this and reload this game let's see this time this is a different game right so you can run this directly and yeah this will work for this also so for two to three time you can just reload the game and try this out right so this is the exercise using while loop the previous one was using for Loop now I hope you are clear with when we'll be using for Loop and when we'll be using while because here we don't know how many jump we have to do how many times these statements whatever you will write in while loop like jump statement that would be it we don't know so that is why we use while loop here right so that's it for this video now in the next video we'll be seeing one more hurdle that is something different and little bit tough right so first please watch out the previous video and this video then the next video would be very easy for you guys so now I'll see the next tutorial number bye take care
