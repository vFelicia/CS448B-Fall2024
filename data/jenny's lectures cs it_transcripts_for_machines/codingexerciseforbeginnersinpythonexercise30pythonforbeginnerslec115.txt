hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Pon programming language we are discussing Turtle Graphics uh in the previous videos we have discussed two coding exercises on Turtle Graphics that was simple one right so one more coding exercise we will see in this video this is a little bit more difficult than the previous ones right so let me just show you first what you have to generate right let's see so you have to generate see this random work of turtle with any random color like this we don't know in which direction Turtle will move like if I'm heading towards this this direction then I'll move first maybe this direction or maybe in this direction or this direction or backward right like back so in which direction I'm going to move I don't know the turtle is going to move right that is also randomly you have to choose the direction and as well as random colors you have to choose but I guess the random colors concept we have implemented in previous video in previous coding exercise so that thing you can take from that this video from the previous video but now you have to figure it out how to move this Turtle randomly in this that in these directions North like east west north south in which direction we don't know so Random randomly you have to choose okay just a simple concept you have to apply that's it so pause the video think and try this out so I hope you have done this let's create in the project a new file random workor turtle. py right and the first was the previous was Turtle shapes we have drawn so see we have implemented the color concept we have taken a list of colors and randomly the color would be chosen the pen color right so this concept we will take from this video right okay first obviously from Turtle we have to import because we are going to uh what we can say make create an object of this Turtle class so let's take to is equal to turtle and obviously you have to import random module as well import random right fine now at first Turtle would be in the center of that screen right so we don't know in which direction the turtle will move like east west north nor or South right because as I have shown you see this turtle is moving either east west north or south it's not to any particular angle like like a 45° angle 72° angle I hope you have noticed in this thing right so angle would be either 90° or maybe 180° right or maybe 270° or 360° something like this right it's not like in between of these 45 72 or 20° or like this right right okay so for that to implement this thing we have actually okay many ways but I'm going to tell you here two ways right we can generate a angle between 0 to 360 we have a function see if you remember Rand range function so you just give the range 0 to 360 and third we can give third argument number of steps number of steps 90 so it it will generate either zero then number of steps is 90 so after zero 90 after 90 180 after that 270 so this is the perfect function method to use from random module Rand range but you have to give the number of steps because if you give either 0 or 360 only then obviously it can generate anything from this range maybe 45° 9 or 20° 15° 10° but that we don't want we want only these things so just provide number of steps 90 right one way is this okay so let's solve this first with the help of this way so what we can do now how to give we have like left and right left or right either or just provide the angle right right but it's not like that every time we know Turtle will move to left or Turtle will move to right we don't know so we cannot particularly set left to right position so for that we have a method so here in Turtle Motion in these method Turtle method we have a method set heading set heading means just have to set the head of the turtle in which direction the turtle head is right so you just have to give here to the angle right and the angle some common Direction degrees are 0° 90° 180° 270° that's exactly we want right so you can just set the heading in the we just provide these things and just you know write down here set heading no left and right you have to give that's it or you can write down here set H also so what we can do here Tom dot set heading right and in set head heading what angle you will give it would be in this range from 0 to 360 steps is 90 from this range that is it right but obviously you have to obviously we'll write a what we can say four Loop to move so for like in range how many steps first let's see uh only 50 50 steps I want to move first first set the heading of the turtle and then we will move so how we will move if the heading is in this direction then move the turtle to this side only so forward so for that we have forward and let's just move by only 10 pixels or 10 steps you can say right and one more thing at last from do screen dot main Lo to hold that screen okay let's see what's happening see my turtle is is moving I don't know like in randomly in any direction okay but it's like let's just increase the width of the turtle because it's not visible so Turtle dot width is suppose 10 okay now it's visible see right and if you want to change the shape as well then also you can change shape if you want to get a feel of using actual Turtle then you can change this like turtle right so yeah turtle is moving right but yeah I want some color as well by default it's black only right so let's uh take from the previous video same list of color I'm going to take so every time I want to change the pen color so change the pen color to from this list randomly choose from this list so Random dot we have a function choice and from what list list name is colors right okay let's run this and see this turtle is like choosing randomly from these colors okay let's move this to 20 or let's move this to 30 then you will get it better see now you can get this now the random work of this Turtle but for more thing because we have taken like named colors because we have taken only I maybe I I guess 10 to 15 colors only but how many colors we can use I have told you there is a in pen color you can go and check if you go to pen color then we can just provide either color string or in RGB format also we can give these are the colors we can give but obviously we will not just copy paste all the colors as a list I just want without making the colors a particular list without the named colors it will choose any random color right according to RGB value see R means red green and blue this values 240 248 255 if this is the RGB value then the color is L blue like this right so I want the just the RGB value I want to give RGB value and color would be automatically picked that thing I want I don't want in my program to give particular the list of the colors and from that list only just choose random colors no because that is named color I have given colors but I want to choose my program to choose colors according to RGB value so can you do this pause the video and try this out I hope you have done this so for that obviously if you will give RGB value how we can give yes we can give in pen color in tle we can give any value of RGB see set pen color to the RGB color represented by the tle of RGB see it's tle it's not list and why tle you know list is mutable you can change the you the item of the list modify update the list right but tle is immutable once set the item in the tle we cannot change the value that is why like if your website you have set some color so definitely we want no one can change that thing the RGB value that is why we are taking tle because it's immutable after setting we cannot change the RGB value anyone cannot change the user can't change the RGB value because if you change then it will definitely give error you can check out this thing we already discussed when discussing the tle video in Python right but now okay we will give RGB value but the range see in this it's 255 239 219 and every RGB value is having different different 0 0 255 0 0 238 for this color blue 1 blue two but the range is what in which range we can take the RGB value that you have to find out first right so for that just go to the this documentation and see it's within this tab you have each of RGB must be in the range 0 to color mode now what is this color mode where the color mode is either one or 0 1.0 or 255 you can set color mode either you can take it either like one or if you'll take zero that is also fine or 255 these values are allowed so how to set the color mode because if you use this thing in your program then obviously you have to this range would be from zero to color mode so you have to set first color color mode either to 1 or to 255 right you will not set zero because I'll show you why if you'll set zero color mode then what will happen so let's check color mode Let's link on color mode and it's Turtle do color mode one of the values one 1 or 255 right generally we take 255 so the RGB value range can be 0 to 255 right you can take zero you can take one also color mode then the RGB value would be in the range of 0 to 1 0 to 1 means it would be in some float value decimal value but typically we we take color mode value 255 so it would be from 0 to 255 the RGB range right and that would be proper integer value 0 1 2 3 4 like this right as you see in this specification but from 0 to one also you can take like on on this website we have this thing this RGB calculator you can calculate here RGB values according to the RGB so you can just increase this and this will give any different color right see but it is from 0 to 255 only maximum is 2 255 so first let's change the color mode to first I I'm taking 255 color mode to 255 so you have to change the color mode for this Turtle not for this Stone right this thing you need to take care right okay then if you write here something like this see if I write here Tom dot color mode see there's no color mode for the object it's for the turtle so Turtle dot see color mode just set it to 255 first first right right down okay fine now generate RGB value randomly between 0 to 255 and just take those RGB values right so what we will do in this for Loop only we can write down or different function you can also make for R we will choose randomly from 0 to 255 r g and the third one is B RGB value would be from 0 to 255 right randomly any value right so while changing the pen color rather than this what we can write Tom dot pen color and simple in tle just write r g p these three values those has been generated randomly by these functions RGB right I hope it will work let's run this see now okay first let's just comment out this also then see we don't have any color now named color in our program still the turtle is getting colors according to RGB value that has been generated in this program randomly right so this is the second way rather than named color we can take this type of thing or if you don't want to use this Rand range function then we can make a list Direction and there we can give like 0 90 180 270 these thing and from this direction randomly we can choose the angle so here in set heading rather than this line we can also use this line set heading or set H anything you can take okay randomly choose any color from the list Direction let's run this and see this will also work fine right so this is how we can do or let's increase the speed of this Turtle speed is uh suppose fastest rather than 50 let's make it 100 see so try to do this thing with different different you can say Logics as well or different different way so that's it for this video now I'll see in the next Tut and byebye take care
