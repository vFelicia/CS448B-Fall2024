in the previous video we have seen how to add attribute to your class right how to create your own class how to create object and then how to add attribute right now remaining is obviously in class we are having like attribute as well as methods attribute means the object the you know attributes are basically the things that the object has like I am if I am an object then I'm having my name my phone number address these are objects and methods are the thing that the object does like I do like I do teach right so these are the methods so now in this video we'll see how to add methods to your class right so we have seen in the previous video init function as well how to initialize the attributes right so you please you first watch that video and then come to this video right then you will get it better because for this to understand this video you need to know what is that underscore underscore in it underscore underscore in bracket you have just passed cell what is that function right okay now this we have done in the previous video see the class was instructor okay the class name it should be capital i uh Pascal case uh the convention is Pascal case v used to name the class but if you you know take small I then it's also fine it will not give any syntax error but it is like the convention is basically to differentiate the class name variable name function name and like this right okay now we will add methods to our class so we are going to create a new file here class methods Dot py and let's take we are having same example I'll be taking we are having a class instructor right and now that init function and we are passing like two two parameter here one is the name and second one we have passed that was address so how to assign the value then self Dot name of the attribute is I'm taking name and here name so see these this and this should be same the parameter name and this value this should be same this name can be different it is not compulsory that this this name of this attribute should be same as the parameter name right these things we have discussed you know in previous video so let's take address and this is what address I am assigning and if you create an object of the class instructor then this time we need to pass if I run this then C you will get an error this instructor is missing two required positional argument line number five here we are creating an object so you have to pass name as well as address so one passing like name is equal to Jenny and suppose address is gurgaon so this time it will not give any error and if you print suppose instructor one wrote name then it will give you Jenny this is how we can access right so you know the self is just a keyword that bind the the the attribute attributes to the argument receive so this init function would be called every time you create an object so if you create two object then two time this init function would be called right so first time it would be called while we are creating this object at in Fifth Line while we are executing the Fifth Line so self means self is referring to the actual object now so self is referring instructor one so self is instructor one at this point of time so instructor one dot name whatever name you will pass Jenny instructor one dot address whatever address you will pass that is right now if I create another object same and instructor 2 is suppose Gia so at this point of time also this init function would be called every time you create an object this function would be called every time so now if we are calling if this function is being called during this time then this time the self is referring to instructor to this object so now self value is you can assume like instructor 2 and name value is Gia addresses same gurgaon so now selfish instructor 2 dot name gr instructor to dot address I hope now you got the basically the other working why we are using this self here right it is binding the now object attribute to the argument received right okay now we we are we we have a default also like default attribute that is followers because it is not compulsory that every teacher is on phone every teacher is on sorry self dot Instagram so by default rather than passing zero zero zero for every teacher if you have created 10 object then every time you will pass zero zero zero as an argument if you write down here followers as a parameter but set the default value so by default you don't need to pass 0 here now followers would be 0 0 for every object you create right or rather than this one more ways what you can create a class object variable here followers is equal to 0 rather than here so now this here see we are not using any cell keywords self growth follower no because these are outside of this init function so this is what a class object variable for every object that you create from this class instructor instructor class the follower this attribute would be Associated to every object and for every object the value of polar would be zero so see if you want to check then if you want to print like instructor one dot followers then you will give you will get 0 see although we haven't initialized this we are not passing any follower here we haven't initialized here self dot follower zero so where from where this is taking the value follow a zero for instructor 2 also follow us value is 0. right now this is what just a quick recap of the previous one because we are just adding the attribute we have just started attribute now how to add methods so methods are basically simple you can say these are functions like if same what is the syntax of creating a function def function name and round bracket and if you want to pass any parameter just pass the parameter right same you can say that um syntax is here depth function name suppose simple I am taking display function and if you something like this if you put these bracket then automatically here you will get self keyword because this is compulsory on every if you call this display method on this instructor one then the self will bind this function to this object on which you are calling this display so at this point of time self is a structure one if you are calling this display function on instructor 2 object second object then at that point of time self will become instructor 2. so it will basically bind right the function or the method to the object on which you are calling this method so means a function becomes method when it is attached to a particular object right that is why we are not calling it function we are calling it method so here I am simply printing like print and suppose I print hi that's it this is the simplest example I'm taking right and on instructor 1 how to call this method now if you call this if you access this method using first object then simply we cannot write down here like display and just call display function no it will give error see the name display is not defined in line number 11 right so you have to attach this with the object name so on instructor 1 I want to call this display function so instructor 1 dot display right this is how an object can access the method of a class or attribute of a class object name dot then whatever you want to access display okay if you run this see you are getting Jenny high and C yeah you are getting none here so where is the problem why you are getting this none so please pause the video and try this out why you are getting Jenny High then none sorry so see the problem is it will print Jenny now we are calling in print we are calling instructor one dot display now we are calling this so control would be here right now self is this time instructor one so it will print in display we are having just print hi so it will print hi now you are printing means whatever this this will return that thing we want to print but here we are not writing any return statement so if you don't write any return statement then definitely we know every function is going to return something if you do not write any return statement then it will return none so that is why it is returning none here and we are printing none we are getting the answer Jenny higher than none so just remove this print and simply call display function on instructor one object right now let's run this see Jenny and hi right I hope you got this now this is the simplest example you have taken now suppose basically methods are basically you know the actions we perform on the attributes may be using the values of the attributes and do something or maybe modify the attribute value and do something and return some result that is obviously the use of methods it is not about you know any use like just print hi but this is just to make you understand like how you can define a function right now if you want to print if suppose I want to call this one here so it should print hi I am I am genuine because instructor one name is Jenny so can you do this yes you can pause the video and try this out so hi I want to print hi I am gen so from where I will get Jenny from the name attribute in name attribute of instructor 1 I have gen so from the name attribute just fetch the value so directly if you write name here so obviously you have to use F string then what do you think you will get Jenny or not let's run this C it is giving an error here display line number two and line number eight High I am this name name is not Define name is not defined just it's just a variable and we are using here not just simple variables attributes you have to attach this variable to a specific object for Which object you are using this name obviously instructor one so rather than obviously instructor one dot name here you will write self one note name so sorry self dot name because here self is referring to that particular object on which you are calling this display function so here cell phone is instructor one so automatically it will fetch the name from instructor one hi I am Jenny right I hope you got this so the self keyword you will get you know many times within this class only not outside of the class we are using cell we are using within this class only cell right and my name is Jenny and suppose I want like I teach python so I want to pass a parameter an argument as an argument what subject I teach so for that suppose in display I want to pass like I teach python so for this obviously you need some parameter to fetch to you know uh store that value that string so I'm just taking a parameter name subject name right hi I am the name and I teach now how you will fetch that thing I teach the subject name the python python it should print hi I am Jenny and I teach python so you can pause the video and try this out okay I hope you have done this and you just need to write down here subject name no need to write down self load subject name first let's run this and see I'm Jenny and I and I teach python why you are not writing here self dot pipe so uh dot subject name if you write this thing let's run this and you will see you will get a error message like in line number 12 here you are calling this and then in line number eight line number eight means uh here here you are defining this function right now what this is this line an attribute error it's an attribute error instructor object has no attribute subject name because when you access self Dot like this then this should be an attribute because I am using self dot name because name is an attribute of that object it's an attribute in this class but subject name is not any attribute we have only two attribute name and address right so how this self can bind because this can only bind the attribute this attribute to that particular object but subject name is not any attribute we are just passing an argument so simply you will pass Python and it will take the value from subject name python no need to write down here self load subject name I hope now you got the difference why I am writing a self dot names and here just subject name we are not passing any name here and we are still getting name Jenny right because it is an attribute of the object and we are passing subject name and we are getting obviously the subject name right so now if you don't know like maybe subject name if I pass like python simply python then it will give error python is not defined in line number 12. right because this this is expecting a string as an argument so like the proper ways you can just write down here in comments like hash and this will accept subject name as a string right or expect a string as a subject name so to Define that thing you can write down here that proper thing so that if anyone see your program then he or she will get yeah they have to pass string right so this should be string here and if suppose if you want to update the follower count right so if suppose I take another function depth update followers right and obviously it will be self and on instructor one I am calling this function on instructor 1 Dot update follower right and here I want I just pass a name it means that person has started following instructor one so the follower count of instructor 1 would be increased by one right so the follower count of self load followers of that object on which we are calling this function so definitely you will write yourself self dot followers count will increased by one right so here I am passing a suppose name like pile means pile has started following instructor one and instructor one is Jenny means pile has started following Jenny so Jenny's followers would be plus one right and now if you print like instructor one dot followers then see what you will get okay it is giving an error because in line number 17 here we are passing instructor type error it takes one positional argument but two are given okay to accept obviously to accept this pile you have to give up obviously the parameter name because one is self to and one is pile for pile to accept pile you have to give a parameter name follow our name see now hi I am Jenny I teach Python and one now follower count of Jenny is one it's starting it was Zero now see you have updated the attribute right so this also you can do if if suppose I have one more instructor instructor too and on instructor two for instructor two I am just printing followers then it will give zero see one was for instructor one and at last we are getting zero so that is for instructor two because on instructor 2 you haven't pulled this update follower function right if you call this update folder function on instructor 2 as well like instructor two Dot update follower and suppose Jenny has started following instructor to instructor 2 is Gia so let's run this now both are having two two obviously you have to okay still zero because we are printing here so after update after calling this update you have to you have to print instructor to wrote follower right see now both one and one for both it's one and one right four over count so this is how you can add methods and so you can I hope you got how to add methods and when you use self load the name and like without self uh where when you can write down any variable name or attribute name sorry this is not attribute this is just a variable right or argument you are passing fine so now you can try this out like maybe you can update for maybe you can create two more objects and you can update the followers right or maybe you can try to print like follow account as well as following count if I started like someone GS started following me so my follow account would be one and Gia's following count would be one right followers and following if you are on Instagram then you know this thing right followers and following two things are there so you can play around with this code So based on this we'll be discussing one exercise in the next video so I'll see the next video bye take care
