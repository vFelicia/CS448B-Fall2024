hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing functions in Python in the previous video we have seen like how to return multiple values from a function and how to use multiple return statement within one function right so now we'll be doing one coding exercise simple one and that is you have to find out number of days in a month suppose I enter like January then it will tell number of days are 31 February 28 like this like December 31. okay but here is one twist if it is a leap year in that case in February we are having 29 days so that also you have to apply that logic if the year is Leap Year then suppose to think usable letter first is enter a year suppose I am entering here two zero two three enter a month month we will be entering not to January February like one two three four like this one means January 2 means February like this so I'm entering like two so two means February in February in 23 number of days 28 like this but if it's two zero two four that would be a leap year so it will give 29. right so you have to apply to logic one is that first need to check the air is Leap Year or not if the air is Leap Year and the month is February the month is two then it will return 29 right we are basically doing this exercise with the help of functions okay otherwise according to you know January February and like this it will give number of days 31 28 30 and like this right so one thing we have discussed how to check a year is Leap Year or not the link of that video I'll put in the side button you can check out that video first in the that video we have clearly you know defined clearly you know defined you can say or discuss the flowchart as well as how to have to find uh how to find out if a year is a leap year or not right with the elbow program also I have shown so you can check out that video first then come to this video okay I hope you heard what is the problem statement what you need to do right now pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have done this exercise now let's do it together let's create a new file and like I'm naming it days in month Dot py see this is a one according to size in which we are checking we were checking like the hair is Leap Year or not so this logic we are going to use in a this program also so two input you need to take from user first is year and second is month using input function we will be taking this input now we're defining a function suppose the name of function I'm taking like uh days in month because we are checking number of days in a month so what you will pass to argument obviously here and month okay so this is what we are calling this function so before calling obviously you have to Define this function so how to define in depth same name you need to take days in month and two parameters so two variable you need to take either you can take same like yeah same name year and month or you can take different name that is also fine like y m or any other thing okay now you need to check see what will put there's one condition if here is Leap Year and the month is February month equal to equal to two in that case it should print 29 otherwise it will print according to like 31 28 30 like this right so we have we have a list like days list I'm taking a name days list equal to for January it's 31 days then at second index like February 28 like this so this list we are having so like at zeroth index for month first January you will access 31 then 28 31 like this from this we can access days in a month according to whatever day you provide but here one condition you need to pick like this if like I'm taking year is leap year one is this thing obviously it is not a proper condition we will write down that condition but this thing you need to put right or let's write down its only leap year and and month should be month equal to equal to 2 means February means two January 1 February two like this we are mapping the months then we are not printing we are returning then it this function should return 29. else you can use else or simply without using else also we can write down that that condition that thing else what it will return from this list we will be accessing number of days okay so provide the list name days list and what index we will provide whatever month you will enter but that is not correct because month if I am entering month is 1. means it should fetch this value 31 but this value at least is from at zeroth index because index is done from 0 0 1 2 3 4 like this not one so we should give here month minus one then it will give you correct value if month I am providing 1 then 1 minus 1 is 0. so days list and index is 0 at 0 index we are having 31 so it will return 31. I hope you got this right but how to check if it is a leap year or not this logic we are having leap year logic right so let's copy paste this thing and before this function suppose this is a logic right for finding leap year so what we can do we can just Define a function here for checking leap year depth and what we will pass in parameter only here right and this logic we can put within this so we have to put this thing in indentation as an indented block within this function right so if the ear is Leap Year like if it is Mode 4 it is divided by 4 completely then we will check if it's divisible by 100 if true then we will check if it divided by 400 then only it will be a leap year right else not a leap year but if a number is divisible by 4 but not divisible by hundred then it is a leap year and if a number is not divisible by 4 then it is not a leap year so rather than printing leap year and not leap year we are just returning true and false okay so whatever whatever this function will return that value will accept here so means in this in this condition we are calling this function leap year so if Leap Year and have to call obviously parameter we have to pass here right and month equal to equal to 2 so if it will return to so rather than leap year what you need to do here just write down true and if it is not a leap year then it should return false here same return true and here return false right so whatever it will return we will face we will accept here so if it is returning true means it is a leap year true and month equal to equal to 2 means true and true then it will return 29 if it will return false like it is not a leap year then obviously you will not check this condition because here it is and to be you know to make this condition true both should be true but if air is not a leap year then it will return false means false means we will not enter into this if part and else it will return days list month minus one Whatever month you will enter right so just because it is returning we are not printing here so we have to accept that thing in a variable like let's suppose days and simply we will print that variable days okay let's run this and see what output you will get here definitely roads and invalid syntax where we have C this should be here now let's run this entire year here is 2 0 2 3. and month is supposed to means February it's 28 let's run this again and let's enter a leap year so 2024 would be a leap year okay month is 2 it should be in 29. see it is returning 29 right or any other we can also enter like f 2 0 to 2. and it's 5 means may may is 31 so it will return 31. okay I hope you got the logic it's not so tough if you are not getting this it's okay you can take a break you can just write down this thing the complete logic a piece of paper and dry on this manually rather than on your laptop one by one like first this line then this line then this will happen then calling of the function like this and like this then definitely we'll get it so see in if statement we can write down any expression like any condition like this or we can call any function in like this right so here we are not printing the values we are returning values so what is the difference between print and return when we should print the values when we should use print when we should you know use return in a function right so this thing will be discussing in next video right so I hope you have got this for exercise now in the next video we'll see what is the difference between print and return these are two different concept right so now it's in the next video till then thank you
