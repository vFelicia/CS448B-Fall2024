hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so if you are a btech mtech or BC student and you want to start your coding journey and you want to make your career in this it field tech field right then this video is definitely going to help you right see once you're going to start your coding Journey then then many questions comes in your mind like which programming language is best for placement which programming language is in Trend right now and which in which field you should go which field is having more and more job opportunities in future like should you go for machine learning AI web development app development or you should you learn DSA and many things are in your mind right and you are totally confused see if you are that student you have a clear path like I won't to go in this field in machine learning you have interest then you choose that one and go for that thing right but 90% of students are still confused their ultimate goal is to get a good placement right to get a good job mainly into those top tech companies right they don't know like which domain they should go they don't have any you know clear path right so this video is for those confused student what should be the road map to get a good job how you should start your coding Journey what you should learn the resources from where you should learn right and what you should do to not quit because many students almost 90% students quit after starting their coding because yeah that is stuff that is for sure right so what you should do to motivate yourself all these things we'll be discussing in this video right so first thing is when you're going to start your coding Journey definitely first thing is you should pick any one language now here my you know uh my uh suggestion for you is do not just waste your time by searching which programming language is best which programming language is in Trend which programming language is best for placements right like don't waste so much time on these these things because to be very Frank there is no such best language right because there are many domains many subdomains and it's not like that you just learn one language and that's it for you guys in this especially in this it field yeah to enter into an industry into this field just pick one good language and that's it but over the period of time to you know uh get yourself promoted to switch company wise and you know to switch company to company and to get good appraisals to you have to upskill yourself so you have to you will have to learn many languages also right because you know technology is changing rapidly so you can't be just you can't be that you know rid like I know this language and I will work on that language only I know this framework I'll work in in this framework only right if you want to sustain in this industry for long right then you have to upscale yourself so you will learn many any language also over the period of time so there's no such like learn any uh there's no such rule like learn one language and that's it for you guys no right yeah but the first language you choose that is important one the first thing is if you are clear like you want uh you want to go in machine learning Direction machine learning data science data analyst then go for Python language for sure right if you are clear like you want to go in web development right go for JavaScript you want to go in app development like Android specifically in Android then go for Java for IOS app development go for Swift language right and there are many more languages also the popular one and the one language which is having more opportunities for you guys that is only I'm going to tell you in brief right and if specifically for placement you want to learn any language right there is no particular domain like in which field you want to go you want a good placement you want a good job at last in after your final year then go for either C++ or Java both are equally good and if you want to go for game development pick C++ that is good right so according to the domain you choose any language but if you are confused General thing you want to uh you know learn like I just want a good uh good job I just want to learn any language for placement then go for either C++ or Java that is best for you guys because yeah python is also good and the topmost language but see for placements and still for placements and for getting good internship you need to learn DSA these things so for that I think C++ for Java is good because they are faster than Python and resources on python to learn these DSA and all these are limited one now first thing you have picked any language go for that language devote one month for that language right learn their Basics and start learning small small programs now you are comfortable in that that language you know the basics right the syntax of that language like Loops how to use Loops conditional statements and variables what varibles keyword constant and functions how to use functions and all these things you know about that language now go for DSC second step is go for DSC DS is still relevant right this question is frequently Asked whether to go for DSA or webd see we can't say clearly that only DSA no development yeah only development no DSA because you have to balance both the things so then go for DSA you have to devote 3 to four months I guess for DSA but these are not enough right just do you have to grab the theory part and then you have to practice problems now the thing is from where to learn these things any programming language if you want to go or if you want to go for DSA or if you want to want to go for any any other course front end development or web development or any other course also then from where to learn see nowadays there are many free resources available right but I personally feel that if you want to learn something really then if there is a structured course on that thing you get structured study material and support and if there is someone to teach you from basic to Advan especially if you are a fresher then that would be more beneficial right so there is a platform Geeks for geks I'm sure you must have heard about this platform if you are doing like your graduation or if you are in this engineering field right they are in this field for so long in this Tech field and on their website you will get many courses structured courses for everything plus you can practice coding problems as well company wise DSA problems and they also you know organize many contest right but here now they they are coming with a new thing they 390 Challenge and what is this challenge if you purchase any course from Geeks for geeks in the month of January and you complete 90% of that course within 90 days of your date of purchase then you will get 90% ref fund of your fee paid for that particular course so you will get here indirectly the motivation to complete that course 90% of that course within 90 days because you want your money back right so the benefit is you will learn you buy more courses and you can save more and more money plus you will learn more and more you will upskill Yourself by learning many things right and by purchasing these courses and you are also saving your money as well right and I think see one thing I just want to clear this this thing is applicable the 90% refund is applicable only if you purchase any course in the month of January means till 31st of January so this thing you need to uh remember right and I think this is the best time to take this challenge because in January generally we we you know our motivation is at Peak to learn something we take new resolutions to you know become a better person to learn new skill to upskill ourself so it is the right time to take this challenge it will give you more motivation also right because once you I know if you are switching from like if you're learning any language and then go for DSA concept then it would be really tough for you guys yeah and many students think to quit because there to solve these questions DSA problems would be these concept of DSA are a little bit difficult right so you need motivation to continue that thing to continue learning you need consistency you need dedication you need to be regular and that motivation you will get if you purchase these kind of courses because you want your money back right so ultimately you'll be consistent you will be regular you'll be dedicated you will be you know disciplined so you can explore their course category and you can go for the any particular course in which you are interested see and these courses are definitely going to help you in your placement Journey no matter in which year you are first year second year third year or final year right so all the relevant links and description I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out so now that was our second step first was to ch choose any programming language to go for that thing second for DSA you have to prepare for DSA for 3 to 4 months and practice problems as well then third thing is if you have time like I'm giving you the complete road map it depends if you don't have time like if you are third year or final year then just prepare for placement and you get a job based on DSC only right suppose you have one or two small project that is fine but if you have time like you're first year student or second year student then third step is go for web development go for development right you can build website or you can go for app development but better opportunities are for web development right in there also we have front end frontend developer backend developer full stack developer right so go for that thing first HTML CSS that are not programming language that are very simple you you can go for that thing also then in programming language go for JavaScript right that is one of the most popular language if you are going for web web development right go for JavaScript then you can go for any framework start developing project then go for back end two things are there Front End plus back end right for back end you can go for nodejs if for front end you have chosen JavaScript or you can go for Jango if you have worked in on Python language then go for Django for back end right now if you are good in both front end back end you can go for full stack developer job also right and for specialist St like front end developer job or backend developer job or full stack developer job for all these kind of jobs you can apply right start making projects small project basic project then some so you know intermediate type of project some good projects right explore that thing also DSA as well as development because both these two skills are still relevant when you are sitting in that interview of these on top tech companies right maybe some startup or small companies are just focusing on a particular language or a particular framework or a particular kind of things so if you're targeting any small company startup or a particular kind of role go for that thing only right that is fine but generally what is important and which is having more and more opportunities especially in those top tech companies fan companies that is I'm going to tell you in this video I'm telling you in this video the road map right so you have to balance both the things if you have time DSA plus development right then now you are in that position that you can get a good job right but still if you have time and you want to explore other things then you can go for like data science machine learning artificial intelligence right so at last in brief I just want to say this thing if you want to start your coding journey and if you are a fresher and if you are looking for those companies top tech companies Fang companies in starting only right then focus on DSA development these things DSA is still important right but if you are not so passionate about these companies companies and you will be fine with any small company or any startup then just be a specialist right specialist means just research about that company that uh in which language on which language that company Works which framework what type of skills are required for that particular role any particular role in that company right focus on that particular skills only right and just learn these things only maybe in that case DSA is not required only development is required and that's it only JavaScript based on that also you can get into those small companies or based on any particular small language you can learn and go into that companies no DS is required right and after one to two year in that company just explore things and then after you can switch top tech companies or any other company right maybe after four or five year of experience if you want to go into those those Fang companies as a specialist then maybe they'll not ask DSA question in interview but these are rare cases General thing I'm I I I know I have told you in this video right so that is a case you can be a specialist also and you can achieve a very good position you can get into these Fang companies as well you can start your journey right and as a generalist also because DSA development everyone do these kind of things so that are more of General things right do that thing also and you can get directly into those Fang companies as a fresher right so I hope the things which I have covered in these things are helpful for you guys if you have any other query regarding placement or internship you can let me know in comment section and I'll see you in the next video bye bye take care
