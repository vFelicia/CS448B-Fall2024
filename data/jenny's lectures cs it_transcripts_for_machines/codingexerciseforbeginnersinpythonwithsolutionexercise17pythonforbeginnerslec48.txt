so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed in the previous video uh one coding is the size we have done one range function what is range function and then based on that one code exercise we have done right now in this videos we'll be discussing one question but that is actually a job interview question and this is the basic and the you can see the most important or the favorite question of interviewers they ask this in coding interviews right that is Fizz was job interview question I think you have heard about this a question now what is this question you have to write down a program right that will print number from 1 to n can be anything let's suppose one two hundred one two hundred you have to print number one two hundred so maybe you will say using range function we can simply print one two three something like this right but no there's a twist the numbers which are divisible by three rather than printing that number there it should print Fizz and the number divisible by five for that rather than printing that number it should print buzz and the number divisible by both three and five rather than printing that number it should print Ables other than that simply print the numbers like 1 then 2 then 3 is divisible by 3 so rather than printing 3 it should print fizzy then three then four then five is divisible by five so rather than five it will print buzz like this then 6 6 is divisible by 3 so it will print here Buzz like this it will print till 100 the numbers so I think that's very easy you must be thinking like there are only three condition you have to put in for Loop you can put these three conditions that's just a hint but here one twist is in which order you are putting these conditions that also matters okay so this is just a simple hint you need to take care now pause the video and try this out before seeing the solution right so I hope you have done this exercise now let's check the solution create a new file here and that is fizzbuzz dot p y okay directly because you have to put a for Loop right on the Range one two hundred and then simply put three condition right okay let's write down four I'm taking an variable M number in and the range will be taking what from 1 to 100 I want so one two one zero one right now in this for Loop we'll be checking condition maybe if you write something like this simply write down three conditions like if we'll check the number first of all it says divisible by three so I will check mode three equal to equal to zero then simply it will print face right next condition L if this number is divisible by 5 then simply will print Buzz right LF if the number is divisible by both three and ah 5. so mode 3 equal to equal to 0 and number mode 5 equal to equal to zero both the conditions are true then it will print what phase Buzz okay other than this other than this it will print simply the number so in that will you know the sales part will catch up that thing so print in else will simply print the number maybe you're thinking that's it okay let's see rather than now till this we will take this till 1 to 10 okay to make it easy for you to understand so 1 to 11 I am taking the range let's run this C what it will printing one two then fish then four then Buzz then fifth seven eight piss Buzz then fist then Buzz for 10. you must be thinking it's right right okay but no no no don't say congratulations to you there is some problem in this code if I run this code 1 to 16 because if 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5. so according to the question at 15 it should print Fizz was right okay let's run this and see see after 14 13 14 at the place of 15 it is printing just Fizz but it is divisible by both 3 and 5 so it should print visuals then you have something wrong with this code okay see now once 15 in number 15 is being assigned so 15 is divisible first condition would be checked obviously sequentially it will go the control 15 divisible by 3 15 more 3 equal to 0 yes it is divisible by three so it will print simply phys because this condition is true and once it finds one condition is true it will not check other conditions so it will skip all the other part but we want that at this time this condition should be checked so how it is possible we can write down this condition here at first place right and after that these two conditions so that may work I don't know let's see if rather than writing here I am writing this thing here so we'll simply print first we'll check this condition if this is the case printf is else sorry l a L if number division by 3 then press then 5 then Buzz so you can write down number this condition before here rather than 3 you can check with 5 and here you can check with 3 that is fine because they are these are not overlapping right so simply I'm adding 3 then 5 in else part will simply print the number let's run this on this board see now add that that 15 number it is printing fizzbuzz now it's working fine I am not saying that this is you know a clean and maintainable code and the best code I have you know I have written for this problem no but this is one solution there may be many solutions right just to make your code like more maintainable and clean and all rather than writing these elephant and if statement multiple times maybe you can use one solution we have that you can use switch statement also all right because see in this case if the number is like there's a number seven so I want rather than first of all it will check this condition then this condition then this condition and then it will go here and it will print seven so rather than checking all the condition I want it should directly print seven rather than checking all the condition that means you know it would take I think less time so for that we can use switch case statement also but this is one way to solve this problem right I hope you heard the logic now you can try this out the different different ways you can solve this problem right so this problem is the favorite one to be asked in coding interviews so you must try this out right so I hope if any interviewer asks this question from you you can easily answer this question you can easily write down the logic and all right now in the next video we will uh be seeing one python project we'll make a python project one we have done that is rock paper scissor the second project is this in this series right so now I'll say the next little till then bye bye take care
