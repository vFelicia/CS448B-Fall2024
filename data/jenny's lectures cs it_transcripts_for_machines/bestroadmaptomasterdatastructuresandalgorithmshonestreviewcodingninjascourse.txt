hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so I hope from the title you have got the idea this video is going to be about data structure and algorithm which is a very important subject for a computer science student and see many students ask these type of questions from me and I hope I'm sure you will also have you also have these kind of questions in your mind like as data structure a must for any interview or it just a Hy and if yes then how many how much data structure uh you know which topics how many topics you should learn to sit in an interview to crack a to crack an interview right and from where to learn from where to start DSA learning DSA the platform or the courses which courses are good how many problems you should sold to get a good command on data structure and algorithm right especially for a beginner it's uh you know very confusing type of thing like yeah we know DSA is important for any job interview but from where to start learning DSA and what should be a proper road map an ideal road map from where you can solve the problem which kind of problems basic Advanced intermediate definitely it's very important to solve quality problems right so which platform is better these type of questions so I will try my best to answer these questions in this video okay now first of all let me just let uh just let me just give you a brief overview of data structure and algorithm what is DSA data structure and algorithm now what is data structure data structure is basically you know just a way of storing and organizing or you can say managing the data okay store a data in store data in such a way that you can access you can manage you can process you can retrieve that data easily and efficiently okay so it's just a way to store that data to organize that data to man manage that data okay and there are many basic and advanced data structures I hope you have heard these like arrays link list stack cues trees graphs hashmap tries many data structures okay and see all these data structures are designed to store data you know in such a way to fulfill a specific purpose to suit a specific purpose right so now what are algorithms algorithms are just processors to solve a problem or you can say a step by step explanation step by step processes to solve a problem to perform a computation to perform a task right like if you want to cook something so you go to YouTube and you just see the recipe maybe you just take down the steps all the recipe on a paper so that paper those steps are just algorithm to prepare that food to cook that item okay so it's an algorithm so same to solve a problem in computer also we have have algorithms okay you just write down in simple English language in the steps like to add two numbers so first take input from the user then add two numbers then output then print the sum like this so these three or four steps are just algorithms so these are algorithms so many algorithms are there like uh if you want to sort some numbers then there are many sorting algorithms like uh bubble s insertion quick merge many sorts many sorting algorithm searching algorithm linear binary search graph traversal DFS BFS shortest distance finding algorithm Destra bman for Floyd warell many algorithms are there right so these are algorithms so data structure and algorithm this combined these topics so here in data data structure algorithm you will learn different different data structures arrays link list stacks cues trees graphs hashmap these are Advanced data structure tries so and their implementation their applications how to use the data those data structures as well as algorithms sorting searching short distance finding algorithm graph ders algorithm as well as dynamic programming which is also very important topic in DSC from interview point of view okay so these topics comprise DSC data structure and algorithm right now uh if you are a beginner then let me just tell you before just directly jumping to data structure algorithm what should be the proper approach okay or what should be the proper road map or what are you can say prerequisite to go for DSC so first thing you just pick a language any object oriented language like AB C++ Java python any language you can pick and start learning that language the basic building blocks of that language first like basic syntax in that language then variables then you can say what keywords and operators in that language then conditionals like ifls loops and functions so these are basic building blocks of any language so first have a good command on these things and then start writing code okay next thing what you need to do learn go for complexities now why complexities if you don't have any idea about comp complexities can you write down a program yes of course you can write down any program then why complexities are important see you are going now for DSA data structure and algorithm okay now DSA the main goal of DSA is to solve a problem efficiently and effectively okay to write down a program for solving any problem efficiently effectively that program should be efficient okay now if there's a problem and me and my friend has written the program the to solve that problem so there can be many ways to solve a particular problem it's not like that there is only one way to write down a program to solve a problem there can be many ways now how we are going to compare which program is better mine or my friend's program okay which approach is better okay based on what you are going to compare those programs see generally in class we compare students based on marks like if one is having higher you know marks then he's good or she is good like this we going to compare based on marks okay now how we are going to measure how we going to compare those programs based on complexities here complexities comes into picture Okay so complexities are measured to you know compare those programs those approaches to solve that problem now there are two complexities type of complexities time and space so time complexities are going to measure the time taken to execute that code and space complexity is going to measure the amount of space or you can say amount of memory required to execute all the functionalities of that code okay now the one approach with less time taken and you know less space required is obviously better than the other one if my program is taking only like maybe 0.5 second to execute and my friend's program is going to take 1 second or you can say 3 second to execute then obviously my program is better okay because I'm taking my Approach is taking less time okay so based on complexities we are going to compare those approaches and programs or algorithms right so before going to DSA complexities are also important you have to go through complexities okay those notations biger notations Theta notations like this then you can go for DSA topics so these are Broad three steps learn any language then complexities then go for DSC topics now how much time you need to complete this DS course see it depends if you don't have if you're a beginner if you don't have any structured course okay you are just learning from here and there so maybe sometimes some for some students some students can take only you know almost 1 year 1 and a half year 8 months 9 months to complete TSA course it depends on your capabilities and the resources you have okay but if you have proper structured course proper resources you have then hardly it will take four to 5 months to complete DSC course okay you'll be good during the after 5 months in DSA you'll have uh you know good problem solving skills you'll have good knowledge of data structures you'll have good knowledge of algorithms okay now obviously it depends like how much time you devote during that five month five months or how much you dedicated you are to learn theay okay now how many problems next question is how many problems you should solve to get a good command on DSA you know it also depends on student to student and on the quality of problems you solve okay now if you're dedicated and you solve some quality problems maybe 100 quality problems you have solved 200 quality problems you have soled and the one which is randomly solving any problem like maybe 300 problems he has solved then me and you have solved 200 quality problems then you are better your problem solving skills would be better okay so it depends which type of problems you solve so now if you search for DSA courses then on YouTube also you will get many free courses on DSA many free courses are available many paid courses are available okay nowadays many if you want to learn anything you will get on internet right and yeah there are many good DS resources even I also Al have one DSC course which is very good but the problem in these free courses is what you are learning from YouTube you are getting everything the video is good okay but the problem is if you get any doubt then who is going to solve that doubt you cannot directly ask to that instructor okay maybe you can comment below that video and chances are maybe you will get answer of your question but every time definitely for a YouTuber for a content creator it's not you can say easy for answer all the questions okay in a free course so you will not definitely you will not get answer of all your questions all your doubts you can ask your colleagues you can search on Google and there are many resources but what if there is someone to help you at that time only to solve your doubt someone you can trust a teacher a teaching assistant you can say okay so I think that would be great that option and that is not available on definitely on free courses this doubt resolution support is not available and even in many paid courses also this thing is not available doubt resolution support okay so here I'm going to review for you a course provided by coding in jazz there you will get all these features Under One Roof okay let me just show you first the curriculum of this course so this is detailed curriculum of this DSC course by coding in jazz you'll get here see first introduction to programming that language you can learn you can go to any course like C++ you can choose C++ python course or Java course okay now first they going to teach you that basics of programming so they have divided this into subtopics and then details as well as what they are going to teach okay in that under that topic under that subtopic then comes to loops and functions arrays and then character arrays 2D arrays and strings then comes to data structure problem solving techniques that here we have subtopics like pointers and dynamical location complexities time and space complexity STL recursion backtracking okay then comes to oops concept Basics oop basic oop concept and then Advanced concept of oops like function overloading obstruction capsulation inheritance polymorphism these things virtual functions then linear data structure link list stats and cues then trees then Advanced data structure like priority cues hash map price graphs and then important topic is dynamic programming introduction to dynamic programming and then applications of dynamic programming some problems also so this is what our you can say car complete curriculum of this DSC course so now let me just go to their website coding nj.com the link I'll put in the description box of this video okay and I'm going to log in with my mail ID after entering OTP I just logged in and just click on this my classroom and I'll be redirected to this page I have already enrolled here in these courses okay here see this is this type of page would be opened and I have already enrolled in these courses okay so this the these courses are shown in my profile now here you can see you can interact with your batchmate also you can start conversation with your batchmates here you can set weekly goal like I have set three days a week you can addit your goals 2 days a week 3 days a week or any goal you can set weekly goal you can set let me just show you the course this basics of C++ with the data structure and algorithm okay the start date of this course is 2nd of October right now let me just show you the course content they have divided this course see weekly and this is the leaderboard okay now you can solve a problem and then you are going to enter into this leader board then you will get your ranking here you can bookmark your important notes okay now see introduction to C++ and then data structure in C++ so weekly they have divided the scores so in week one lecture one is flowchart then lecture to let me just show you once you will click on this lecture this type of page will be open and see now you can play this and you can learn so here you have lecture then problem also see this is the problem and you can solve this problem you don't have to submit this thing then decision making lecture then also they you have problems lectures problems and then you have notes as well so everything you are getting Under One Roof notes lectures like video recorded video as well as problems assignment also you are having okay so you will have mcqs as well the lectures as well as mcqs you can submit your options and I have gone through these lectures few lectures the instructor is very good so based on if I need to give the rating based on faculty teaching style I like it and I'll give it 9 out of 10 the explainer the way the faculty is explaining the concept from basic every point it's very good so it's nine out of 10 from my side and the course structure see weekly they have divided the scores right then patterns after that operators and Loops then arrays everything as well as the quality of questions they have given is also good then searching and sorting character arrays and after that string so the course structure based on C structure I'll give definitely eight out of 10 and after that data structure and algorithm which is logged and it will be unlocking on 27th of November this is also you know weekly they have divided this thing right you can see pointers Dynamic location STL then complexities then oops concept then link list straps skes trees after that BST priority cues recursion dynamic programming PR hmen everything and the thing which I like the most is that doubt resolution support So if you are watching any lecture you have any doubt so you can click on that ask or view doubts okay and you can just select you help me with code questions or concept which kind of doubt you have okay you can just select that thing and accordingly you can select everything like understanding what regarding which you need to ask your out okay maybe need more clarity you can describe your issue and you will get answer let me just show you so I have asked this questions and I have got reply I have got response from that ta within seconds and then I have waited I guess for 1 minute and then I got reply so this doubt resolution support is very would B based on that I'll rate this thing 10 on 10 okay because this this is one thing I like the most in this one so if I need to give the overall rating to this course like you know faculty teaching style course structure course content out resolution support the type of problem quality of problem then definitely I'll give 9 out of 10 okay now you will have extra 10 15% discount extra 15% discount on this course if you
