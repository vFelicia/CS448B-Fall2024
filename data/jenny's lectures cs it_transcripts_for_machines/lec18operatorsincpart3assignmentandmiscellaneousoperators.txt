so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing operators in C plus plus till now we have discussed arithmetic relational bitwise and logical operators now next type of operator is assignment operator so this video will be discussing assignment operator as well as some slainess operators we have like a conditional operator which is known as ternary operators also right that we have discussed like uni three categories of operators are there unary binary internally so conditional operator is ternary operator so that also comes under miscellaneous we'll discuss in this video then size of operator then cast operator then we have that address of operator then we have that the reference operator that asterisk a pointer to a variable so these are some miscellaneous operators so these operators and assignments operators will be discussing in this video with the help of program I'll show you practical also right example of each and every operator will see on my laptop right but before they just want to tell you one thing Geeks four weeks has come up with a fun filled event for you guys called geek Olympics so what you have to do is you just go to the link which I'll put in the description box of this video and a resistor for the event free of post and once you register after registering you will get access to the calendar where you can see the upcoming events and activities see they have something new and something different every day in the month of July from 1st to 31st of July so do check out this link every day where you can get a chance to win some rewards and definitely it would be a great learning experience for you guys now let me just brief you on one of such events through geek Olympics which is 24 hour doubt support Marathon yes Geeks four Geeks is conducting a 24 hour doubt support Marathon for free when their mentors will be live for 24 hours on 9th of July to solve all your doubts so whatever doubt in which subject you have you can ask all your doubts but for that you have to register first so register now the link would be in the description box of this video you can go and register and the timing and this loads would be like this that you can see on my screen from nine on 9th of July the that this session would be started from 9 am so from 9 am to 11 am Python and machine learning then from 11AM to 1 pm at a linked list stack and cues like this you can see on my screen so all the relevant links and detail I'll put in this in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is what are assignments operators I think these are very simple and no need to discuss C this is assignment operator here not equal to but here in programming languages assignment operator which will do whatever the value in the right hand side it would be assigned to the left hand side right like we write like a is equal to 5 so this 5 could be assigned to a so this is assignment operator now you can combine this operator with something like this plus equal to so it means nothing but if you write a plus equal to 1 it means a is equal to a plus 1 means just add right hand side to the left hand side and assign the value to left hand side that's it if I write like minus equal to It Means A minus equal to 1 it means a is equal to a minus 1 that's it you can write something like this or this fine it means what just subtract this right hand side from left hand side and assign the value to left hand side that's it I think you are clear with this so you can use this operator something like this with multiplication with the division with modulo also with left shift operator right shift operator and same like if I write a left shift equal to 1 it means what a equal to a left shift one means just left shift this a by one bit and assign the value to left hand side a so you can use this assignment operator with these operators as well right I hope you got this and no need to explain all these operators right now let let's discuss some miscellaneous operators we have first of all we will discuss conditional operator okay now conditional operator comes under which category ternary operator means it used three operands right so this operator is this question mark and column how to write this operator first of all we write some condition then question mark then expression one then colon then expression two so three operands are there for this operator that is why it is known as ternary operator now you can write down this thing see if there are two uh variable we have an end is equal to Three B is equal to 2 and I want to check out the maximum of these two so what you will write if a greater than b a is maximum else B is maximum simple if else but rather than if else you can do this thing with conditional operator as well how just write down the condition here like a greater than b then question mark if a is greater than b then if I write a here then colon then B means if this condition is true then Express expression 1 would be evaluated if the condition is false then Expression 2 would be evaluated that means output would be this if condition is true then I'll proclude with this if condition is false output would be this so if a greater than b if yes it would print a if this condition is false it would print B so rather than writing if else simple in one statement you can write down this thing here you can write down some expression as well right something like this if a greater than B I want to print a plus 2. otherwise B minus 2 something like this it's not like that you have to write down operand only no here also you can write down some expression having some arithmetic operators maybe plus minus or complex expression also but the working is condition expression expression if condition is true first expression would be evaluated means output would be this one if condition is false this would be the output that's it so it would be you can say it's a substitute of if else block like why Tannery because three operands are there so this is what conditional operator right now next we have size of operator so I think you know this meaning of the size of Operator just used to uh you know calculate or the find out the size of a data type or a variable you can say suppose I want to find out size of this a so in C out Simply you can write down size or in bracket you can write down a it will give a is of integer 4 byte or rather than a simply data type also you can write down int that's it right so this is size of operator now next is uh we can say this address of operator what it will give address of a variable suppose I'm writing like in pointer we use these kind of operator in PTR this we have a variable in a and you assign PTR is equal to address of a see this pointer concept we have discussed in C language if you want to find out the meaning of this string and all what is pointed you can check out that video the link of that video I'll put in the side button if not it's okay just I just want to tell you address office address so this operator will give address of a variable right like address of a it will give address of a and that address of a would be assigned to this PTR pointer we'll be discussing pointers in this course also in detail right next is this this is what this operator pointer to a variable operator right or when you want to dereference the value of the sale we generally use this operator right or simply it's a pointer to a variable right we will be discussing in you know these operators in detail the meaning of these operators in detail when we will discuss those pointers right now one is cast operator also we have cast Casting means convert forcefully convert one data type to another data type let us take one example see and it is Unity operator means it will take only one operand right now suppose I am writing here see I am taking a variable float a a variable of a data type is float 6.18 the value I am taking 6.18 f right now I want to print if you simply print a okay it will print the floating point value 6.18 right or maybe 0 0 after that see how it will print up to six digit right now next is I want to convert it into int means I want to cast it into int cast operatory is used to convert one data type to another so what you need to do simply write down in and a because this variable I want to convert from floor to end so just simply put in here in braces brackets and a now it will print only six now a would be converted into int that is only 6 value would be printed so if you want to forcefully convert a data type into another cast operator would be used it is urinary operator two types of this this casting is done one is automatically by the compiler second is manually right so in detail you will be discussing cast operating in a separate video for that you just have but I just want to give you an overview like what is this cast operator and how to use this this is a simple syntax in which data type you want to convert simply write down that and here the operand that's it fine so the types of this type casting like implicit type casting explicit type casting that we'll discuss in a separate video with help of an example so these are some miscellaneous operator and assignment operators so now let me just show you these operators with the help of a program okay so this is our same you know that C plus plus fine operators dot CPP I think no need to discuss assignment operator because these are very simple those uh we have assigned the left hand side right hand side value to left hand side so we'll be discussing some miscellaneous operator see first is the cast operator let's discuss here this is the one cost operator simply simple example I am taking we are taking a value float X is equal to 6.78 and I'm just converting casting it into int and x and we are just printing now the x value right after casting we are Printing and in the next line I am simply printing X without casting so two output you will get here right now let's run this and show you what output you will get see see the first output is 6 because we have casted it into int and the next next one is 6.78 that is float we are simply printing X so that will give float right so this is how you can convert one layer type to another a type forcefully with the cast operator right now next let's see you can try out these operators and you can try out some complex examples also and I just want to tell you the basic you know how to use these operators right if you know the basics how to use the operator how to type casted the syntax I think in any expression or in complex way also you can write down these operators you can use these operators now next is conditional operator C we are having two variable A and B so I'm just want to print maximum see out maximum is see the conditional operator I am writing first of all I'll take simply A and B C condition is a greater than b right then this question mark then a then colon B right so if this condition is true if a is greater than b it will print value of a see the maximum is 3. you can see a is greater than b because a is 3 B is 2 so maximum is a that is it is printing a value a is three if I change it B is equal to 12. A3 B12 now this condition would be false right if condition is false then it will give second expression second expression is B so what is B value 12 so it should give 12. so see it is giving maximum is 12. right now if rather than like a I'm writing here A Plus 2. like simple expression also you can write down and here I am writing B minus 5. right now let's run this and now what output you will get I think seven so see you are getting seven because the condition is not true condition is false so second expression would be evaluated means P minus 5 b is 12 12 minus 5 is 7. I hope you got the meaning of this conditional operator and how to use this so it is basically a substitute of if else statement right and if you want to use the size of operator simply here also you can use C out size of and in bracket I want to print size of I want to find out size of a that's it so now it will give maximum is 7 and 4 because a is of type integer integer will take 4 bytes right 2 or 4 it depends on the you know compiler the machine you are using so now I think size of operate is also fine and this address of operator and that District operator those are related to pointer so that also will be discussing when we will discuss pointers right so I think that's set about these operators in C plus plus so we are done with the operators type of operators and C plus plus in the next video we will see operator precedence and associativity after discussing precedence and associativity then we'll discuss two or three complex you know problems on operators right so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
