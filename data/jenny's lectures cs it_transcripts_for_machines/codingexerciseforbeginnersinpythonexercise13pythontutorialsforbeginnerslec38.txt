so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen what does nested list and how to use necessarily with the help of a program right so till now we have seen about list what is list how to access element of list what is indexing and list what is index error what is nested list right this thing we have seen based on that we will do one coding exercise right this one is little bit tricky so you have to you know concentrate here first of all understand the problem problem statement then start writing the logic right what I want is see I have a metric something like this three into three metrics suppose only like one one one I have in this list sorry in Matrix right and one position I want to select at which suppose I want to hide my money under this one I want to hide my money right so see this these are rows these are columns so one two three three row and one two three column we have in this Matrix three into three Matrix so if I write like if I I want to hide my money at this position 3 2. so first this stands for the Row third row second means second column third row second column here here I want to hide I want to mark this position I want to hide my money under this one so suppose I want to put a x on the selected position I want to put X if I give you the position I give you 2 3. means first second row third column second row third column here I will put X this time right so the position user will enter if I enter the position if I ask from the user and user enter the position one one means first row First Column here I'll mark x this time so this you need to do so here you have to use list concept nested list concept indexing concept right now let me just give you one hint you can consider this is one list this is second list this is third list right and you can print these three lists in the form of Matrix that's very simple right in nested list also we can make one more list and in that list we can put these three lists so that would be a nested list right but what you need to take here here if I enter position 3 2 right means third row and second column here I will mark x but these are list and list index start from 0. so when you consider these three lists so index would be 0 1 2 like this right it means this position is same here if these are separate list we like this is room first list this is second list this is third list list one is two list three right and this is final list so this final list is what honest nested list so here also 0 1 2 means now 3 2 this position is now where in this list here so this list is third list means here but you can access this list with index 2 not 3. when you will actually access that list or that that index then you have to do minus 1 here you have to do something second and in list three also this is what index 1. but position is 2 but index is one so here I will mark x right so I hope this is not much confusing for you guys and you understand you got this problem statement what I want position we'll ask from the user will take input from the user two digit first digit will specify that row second digit will specify the column you have to take hint I have given you three lists one nested list and how you can access that I have told you okay and after accessing this thing you just put X here that's it and after that you can just print these three lists with Slash in like list one slash and list two slash and list three then it will print in a form of Matrix right so pause the video and try this out please don't directly jump to the solution at least give it a try if you stop somewhere take some break 10 to 15 minutes then again try and then go to the solution so I hope you have done this let's create a new file it's a size I guess it's 13 Dot py right now we will take three lists first of all right so let's take suppose Row 1 and there I'm going to store one one one or you can like copy and paste Smileys also right you can directly search you can search emojis and from there you can just open this link and from here you can just copy and paste Smileys no see no app required so if you want you can copy and paste these myelins let me just select one like this suppose Row 1 Row 2 and Row 3 we have three list and there we have this Smiley right we have just copied and pasted this thing let me just show you how to print it let's you know you have to just write down print that function then F string and there where from where we will access first is Row 1 then we will put a slash n then second variable name is Row 2 I want to access then again slash n and then Row 3 right let me show you if I run this then what output you will get see this is the output right now ask position from the user using input function right first you will take input from the user using input function so we'll ask enter the position where you want to put money or you want to hide your money okay now see if user enter suppose I am entering 3 2. but this 3 2 is now a string using input function whatever we will enter that would be a string so this 3 2 is now a string but we have to separate this three uh and separate this two we want to digit because 3 is for rho and 2 is for column so individual digits we want right so okay we know how to access the elements from a string using indexing we can directly access so the position and zeroth index that would be we have first three from here so that we can this 3 is what row number right so we can put here this thing into a variable name number row number is position zero and column number is position first index so now in row number we have 3 and in column numbers in this variable we have 2 separate we have separate the sound but this thing you need to take care here still this 3 and 2 are strings we haven't converted this into integer right so convert this thing into int have to convert just put here directly int and here also hint right so now in row number we have three that is integer in column number we have two that is also integer okay now okay row number is three means this fine but you have to access this thing so first of all what you need to do you have to do a uh format nested list or the name I can write write down like metrics Matrix equal to first list is Row one then we have Row 2 then we have Row three okay now in Matrix we have Matrix is what now this is nested list because here we have list list and the three list so this is nested list yeah it's possible we can create nested list now I want to access this Row Row 3 because row number is 3 this this thing Row 3 first access the row then we will come to column number right but how you can access this this element of this Matrix indexing is what 0 0 1 2 so this Row 3 is at second Index right so how we can access this thing the name of this list Matrix and index is 2. so row number minus 1. row number minus 1. now we have accessed this Row 3 right so that I can suppose I am making variable row selected so row selected is now this row okay Matrix row number minus 1. but within this I now I have the row so you have to just select the column in this row column is what second column second column means it would be index one right so here what we can do we have just selected this row so row selected within this row within this selected row which index you want to access which index put the in square bracket which index this column number column number is 2 but column number minus 1. because index start from 0. so column number minus 1. so you have selected row within that row I have selected the column also and there what you need to put X so equal to X that's it okay now we will print again we'll print these so just copy paste this thing right I hope you got this code this is not that much tough let's run this okay now this is the original Matrix we have now enter the position where you want to hide your money three two C third row second column here it has marked that position let's run this again where you want to hide your money one one so it has marked X at one one position let's run this again where you want to hide your money suppose two three so two means second row third column so this put an X I hope you got this program if not then please have take some break five to ten minutes then read this program and dry run this program note here write down this on a paper dry on this with the help of pen first this line will be executed this line this line this line with the actual values by putting the actual values then you will get it definitely you will get it right so because in the lecture we will see one more coding exercise that would be little bit tricky trickier than this exercise right so now it's your next few days bye take care
