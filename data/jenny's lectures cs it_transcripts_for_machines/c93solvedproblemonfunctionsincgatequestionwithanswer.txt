so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing previous year gate questions on functions in the last video we have discussed one question and in this video we will discuss this question that came into gate 2000 so this the question was you are given a code and you you are asked like what is the value of j what is value of j after the execution of the score this was the question you have to tell value of j right so now we will discuss this question we will try it in this program and i'll show you on my laptop also practically right but before i just want to tell you one thing if you want to build a great career in software development then you must think about the aspects like what's trending in the industry the questions being asked in the interviews what is the thought process behind the great application like amazon flipkart zometo ola and how to improve your code share ranking so here an academy brings you a platform where you can get access to weekly shows which you can watch live and the host of these shows are working in some of the top companies like google linkedin amazon are and are seven star coders on code chef and industry experts with years of experience so here they are going to cover the content which would be really helpful for your career like in the live episodes you can you can get the opportunity to ask take a charge about the top 20 questions being asked and the industry leaders about the recruitment process in top in you know top startups and mncs what is the eligibility criteria and how to apply for them you can also get your resume reviewed by the experts and not only this you can also participate into mock interviews and also learn courses on programming languages cloud computing blockchain and crypto tech aspects of digital marketing and data analytics and there's one more show where adate will cover the comparison in between azure aws and gcp and what are the needs of cloud computing he'll also discuss networking coding devops and the certification for aws so the people this is definitely for the people who are enthusiastic to learn about cloud computing and how the infrastructure of cloud computing works the detail of the show and the badge you will find in the link that i'll put in in the description box of this video and don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get 10 extra discount on your paid subscription so now let's discuss this question this was gate question one mark question right and see whenever you see the code don't just first of all look over overall on the code and see like it's very lengthy how you will solve this no what you need to do you just have to follow the steps and what are the steps when you will execute this thing right first of all where the control will go i hope now everybody know the control will go where to the main function right and one by one just draw what is what is you know what is happening in this program see next line is in i j it means you are declaring two variable i and j it means first of all when it is going to execute some uh two main functions and memory would be located and here we have declared two variable i and j so see if you are a beginner then better to draw something like this step by step what is happening better to draw that thing on your paper on your copy right after that you have if you have practiced many programs then in your mind only in your brain only no need to draw on your paper in your mind only you just imagine this thing and you can solve the question but first better to draw something like this so two variables you have i and j we haven't initialized the variable so some garbage value will be there now next line is for loop now i is equal to zero so in i we have zero condition true zero less than four yes condition true it means control will go here so in for loop we have only one statement that is why we haven't written like that they haven't written those curly braces because in for loop they're just given they have just given one statement now j is equal to this this is what i hope now you are clear this is what function calling right so now now where control will go the definition part of the function here we have the definition part right and once control will go to the definition part means some memory would be allocated to this function also right so now what you are passing here i as an argument now i value is 0 so you are passing 0 so this 0 will be received this i by this i so here also we have what one variable i and here also we have zero now enter here now see static in count if i have written in count zero it means you have declared one more variable count and initialized it to it with 0 but now they have given one more word that is static what does the static mean static means the lifetime of this variable would be throughout the program and the static variable would be initialized only once whenever you call this function again and again this function will hold sorry this this variable count will hold its previous value you cannot reinitialize the static variable again and again whatever i am saying that you will come to know when we discuss the complete process of this program see now in count also we have 0 count is equal to count plus i count plus i 0 plus 0 is zero and that will be stored in count that is zero only now return count it will return zero where the control will go here now here because here you are calling this function so now that zero would be stored in this j right so now in this j we have zero and once control will go out of this function it means what i have told you whatever the variables in this function that has been vanished here we have i and count so this is normal variable so the memory would be freed there is no eye now but count is static variable now see the difference it will hold its value it's not going to destroy it right it will hold zero only right that is why i told you the lifetime of static variables are throughout the program right now see count is still 0 now i plus plus i this the size in this main so this i would become 1 1 less than equal to 4 yes condition 2 again enter here again call the function again control will go here now again i would be declared here now i will receive what now i value is this time 1 so 1 would be passed so in the side we have 1 in count is equal to 0 but here previous value is also 0 so we are not going to initialize it right it will hold its previous value only right count plus i one plus zero one that would be stored in count that is one it will return count one it will return so now in j we have one right and once control will go out this variable this memory has been freed but count will still hold its previous value right now i plus plus i becomes 2 condition true again enter here again we are going to call the function and again one variable is i and this i now this time will receive 2 but count is not going to initialize again by 0 it will hold its previous value because it's static so 2 plus 3 is 2 plus 1 is 3 3 would be in count now 3 it will return 3 now in j we have 3. again i plus plus now i becomes 3 condition true again enter again we are going to call this one now i this time this will pass 3 as an argument because i value is 3 so it will receive 3 now count plus i 3 plus 3 is 6 so now in count we have 6 it will return 6 now and j at this time we have 6 i plus plus i becomes 4 4 less than equal to 4 condition true again enter again we are going to call this function and this time this i will receive 4 count plus i 6 plus 4 is 10 now in count we have 10 return 10 now 10 would be stored in j i plus plus five five less than equal to four no now exit from the for loop and after exiting we just have closing braces right after returning the size no more now right but once exit from the loop exit from the loop means we don't have any statement means the closing braces of main exit from the program and now this count would be vanished and this also vanished but now after completing the execution what is the value of j this was the question so j value is 10 right so you can print it because we are not printing any j value here we are not using any printf statement so if you want to see that j value is 10 or not after this for loop here you just print j is equal to percentage d and j let me show you practical also i hope you got the working of this also this question so gate question this is simple question but little bit tricky right let's run this question and see what output you are getting so now see this is the code and we are printing the value of j here in the main just to check what is the value of j after executing this code so now let me run this and check what output you will get cj is equal to 10 right so i hope you got the working of this code so in the next video you will also see one more previous year gate question on function so i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
