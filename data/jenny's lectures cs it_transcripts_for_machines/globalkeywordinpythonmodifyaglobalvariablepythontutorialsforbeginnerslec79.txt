hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen scope of the variable in Python local and Global as well as blog smoke although there is no such type of soap in Python Blogspot right so we have discussed in previous video local scope and Global scope or you can say what is the local variable and Global variable right now a small concept is remaining that is global keyword yes there is a global keyword in Python why we use that keyword Global keyword is different from Global scope or Global variable okay now try to understand the difference and why we use this Global keyword when to use this Global keyword what is the use of this thing okay let's see this thing with the help of program or you can say example directly right so now I have created this file Global underscore keyword Dot py and simply I am taking that previous example that we have seen in the previous video so I'm just defining a variable a is equal to 10 and I'm just having the same function like display right and if I print this a in within this function then what will happen see first of all tell me scope of this variable is global scope because this is in the main body of the Python code not within any function right this is having global scope right now I am accessing this variable within this function within this function right then what you think it is correct or not yes it is correct we can access Global variable from you know inside of function as well right so it will print 10. okay that's fine now if within this I am having another variable a is equal to suppose 50. right now this time what this a will print it will access definitely this a because this a is local to this function see generally what we do like if something is available at our home then we don't go to our neighbors and you know ask for that thing like sugar or anything else so we go to our kitchen and we just pick out that box of sugar and all if you don't have that thing then you can go to your neighbor and ask for that thing so that is same thing now this a print a means this a is with this this function only so it will access this a only so it will print at this time 15. right if there is no way then it will print the same so but if I'm not having any globally and I want to access this key this a is enough local write local to this function and I am going to print this a outside of this function let's comment out the same now what you think let's run this this will give error name a is not defined right because from outside we cannot access any local variable local available having local scope can be accessed within that scope only means within if you are defining this within this function you can access this a within this function only right not outside of this function okay now see I am having a global variable and suppose see you can access Global variable within a function inside a function that is not a at all a problem but if you want to modify this value suppose if I want to do a is equal to a plus 1. so what you think this print this print a this will print 11. let's run this C it will give an error message local variable a referenced before assignment in line number three you cannot it means you cannot modify a global variable you can access it from within a function right but you cannot modify it but if there is a need urgent need to modify although it's a terrible idea to modify a global variable a global variable having global spoke right but if you want to modify it a global variable then yeah there is a solution first of all you have to use what is the solution you have to use Global keyword Global and the name of variable a now it means you are referring to This Global variable a and now you can modify this a is equal to a plus one now a becomes 11. right so if you print this a here then it will print now 11. so when use of This Global keyword is what if you want to modify a global variable then you can use this Global keyword right means if you want to modify a global variable from inside a function then you can use this Global keyword second second you know thing is what if I am not having any Global a variable right so I'm having a display function and suppose I am having inside a function a is equal to 10 or a is equal to 20. inside this I am having another function I am taking example of nested function a function name show okay and within this function inner function the show I am having Global keyword Global a and a is equal to a plus 1. now what you think like if this a will modify this a and it will become 21 and suppose within this I want to print a okay but for that you have to pull this show function so you can call this function show inside this display only because because it is local to this display not outside of the display and outside we can call display only so what you think this a will print 21 right let's run this see it will give an error name a is not defined in line number six here in line number six is not defined because see global a means outside of this function outside of any function if there is a variable a then it will search for that variable but there is no such variable here so how you can modify that variable okay so suppose if you are not modifying this variable and I am just changing the value a is equal to 30. now pause the video and think what will happen and what this print will print let's run this see it will print 30. okay now I am not using this print inside this show but here outside of this show but inside display this print a then I am calling show and again I am printing a so let's modify this let's print out value of a before calling show function is this and after calling this function is this let's run this and see it's 20 and 20 about the time not 30. why so because C here I am calling I am printing this a so it will search for a local variable a so local variable to this displays this a it is printing 20. now after calling show means you will think Global a and a will become 30 and now at this point of time it will become it will print 30 but no this a is not Global see this a is within this function so it is having local scope there is no Global a so after calling show also it will print a 20 only right and if I print a this outside of this display function then what do you think what does a will print maybe you will think there is no there is no Global a so it will give error no let's run this C 2020 and 30. 30 means this age so Second Use of This Global keyword is what you can create a global variable from inside a function only or you can say from a known Global scope because from a local scope we are creating a global variable so globally means we are referring to a global age so there is no Global is so it will create a a and it will assign the value 32A and now globally it will print 30. so you got the uses of This Global keyword right to create a global variable from a known Global space or you can say from inside a function or second thing is to modify a global variable from inside a function use Global keyword so Global variable Global scope and Global keyword I hope you are not going to confuse in these terms now right so mainly this line will show that we are referring a global variable which is defined outside of this function means which is defined globally right and if there is no Global variable it will create a global variable a and if you assign the value then that value would be assigned to that thing so I hope now you have a good idea of This Global keyword Global scope Global variable and local variables so now you one question for you is this is the code name is equal to Jenny's then in display function I'm just updating modifying this name and printing name after polling again I'm printing this name so what would be the output of this school you can let me know in comment section right now I think that's it for this video that is not so much tough right so now it's in the next little then bye take care
