so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing Loops in C plus plus till now we have discussed for Loop and properties of formal properties means like uh different different ways in which you can write down a while loop some tricky things you can do with while that thing we have discussed in previous videos right the next is while loop so now that thing we'll be discussing in this video what is while loop syntax or while loop flow chart uh working of this while loop with the help of flowchart application so you can say use of while loop with the help of three or four programs we will be seeing these things practically so each and every detail about while loop will be discussing in this video right now before that just want to tell you one thing see if uh your dream is to get placed with a high package in software field then definitely this information is helpful for you guys let me just ask you one thing first why is it important for a pressure to get placed in a high paying software job it's not just about the salary it saves time yeah see instead of getting a hike after two to three years if initially you get placed with a higher package then definitely it saves time right but how do you need to be from the top colleges does your branch matter do you have to be intelligent the answer is no if you have industry relevant skills then companies are ready to offer you high package now you can ask me how see thousands of students need final year of graduates started from zero build industry relevant skills and got placed in high paying software jobs they got hired by thousand plus companies how who is behind all these it is a proven curriculum developed by IIT graduates who worked with the top companies like Amazon Microsoft has product Developers and the name of this uh this proven curriculum is next wave ccbp intensive program see many of us wants to get placed with high package in software Fields but you might not know what skills are required for that and how to learn from where to learn these skills right so to know these things you can attend and make use of the free demo offered by next wave ccbp intensive team link is in the description box of this video and one more thing you can also get a scholarship up to rupees up to rupees 15 000 but it is for limited period of time and it is limited offer so go now and register your free demo I hope it would be a turning point in your career now let's see let's discuss what is for Loop in C plus plus see why we use Loops basically what is need of loop if you want to execute a statement or block of statement repeatedly more than one time five times ten time hundred times so as many times as you want repeatedly you want to execute those statements then then we put these statements in a loop and we put some condition right now while loop is what simply you can write it executes a block of statements as long as the condition the given condition is true now what is syntax of while loop see you simply write y keyword here you will put some condition termination condition we can say and here we write block of statements okay you can write one statement or multiple statements this is block of statements so this is General syntax of writing while loop right let me just take one example see okay so let's see this is the example see in for loop I have told you three basically things are there with for Loop one is initialization then termination condition then modify expression and then we can say one is statements you want to execute soap but in syntax we haven't written any initialization here and any incremental decrement right that in for Loop we have written like in one statement only four here initialization then condition then update or that a modify expression and here we write some statement that you want to execute and again again and again but here in one line we only write here if you only write condition only one thing no initialization no modifying expression so where we write these things and it is not compulsory to write initialization and these things no yeah but it is mandatory too write down to specify the termination condition otherwise unexpected result you will get maybe it would be infinite Loop or maybe compiler energy will get these things also will be discussing one by one right now let's see here this is one example so simply here I am using all the three things this is what initialization before starting of this while loop this is termination condition and here modify expression within this block of statements right so this condition and these are these two are block of statements right so as long as this condition is true then these statements would be executed again and again right so now see int I is equal to 1 we have specified I variable here we have one condition is I Less Than 3 1 Less Than 3 yes so control will enter into this while loop and one would be printed now slash N means next line cursor will be next line you line then I plus plus then it becomes 2. again condition check two Less Than 3 yes 2 would be printed then I plus plus I is 3 now 3 Less Than 3 no now out of this while loop so you will get 1 and 2. right and one thing this while loop is what entry controlled Loop two categories of loop exit control and entry control so it is entry controlled Loop while entering we are checking the condition right exit control means while exiting the loop we will check the condition while entering will not check any condition right like when you go in Metro then while you entering while you will enter into the Metro before entering they will check you if you have any suspicious item or not right and when you go in a supermarket then while exiting the supermarket they will check the items and the bill so this you can relate with these things four and while loop are entry control Loop okay if the condition is not true then you will you cannot enter into this while loop like if you have any knife or any suspicious item you cannot enter into the that Metro and dual is exit control do you can enter in while loop no matter the condition is true or not while exiting it will check the condition right so here these statements would be executed these two statements again and again as long as this condition is true as long as I is less than 3 right now here one thing is very important it is really important to update this eye here if you will not update I here then it would be an infinite Loop if you will not write here then see out I I becomes I it will print one again it will check I is still 1 because no increment is there so 1 is less than 3 yes I would always be less than 3 and it would be an infinite loop again it will print 1 1 1 1 1 infinite Loop would be there right so it's important to update I here sometimes we only write like this condition while one so this condition is always true so we need sometimes in finite Loops so that also we'll be discussing in which condition what are infinite loops and why we use infinite loops and how to control how to you can say uh terminate these infinite Loop that also will see so I hope you got what is while loop General syntax or while loop General work move by Loop let me just tell you let me just show you the flowchart with the help of flowchart the working of value see here we check the condition right if this condition is true then body of while loop or body of loop would be executed or you can say these statement would be executed right and again condition would be checked this should be in Loop once condition becomes false we are going to exit from this Loop right whatever you will write here those statement would be executed but this is with help of flowchart you can show the working of while loop right now use of while loop basically we can use this if you want to check if you want to put some validation on input right that in that case we can use this thing fine let me just show you these users with the help of program so let's create a new file let's write while loop extension is dot CPP right and first is first we will write like for user validation for user input validation we can use while loop how you can write down this thing see so let's take a number suppose n and from user will ask enter number and enter number greater than suppose greater than 6. okay I want a number greater than 6 right so you have to check now number is greater than 6 or not the number you have entered so that thing we can do with this uh how you can write down this thing with white Loop we can write down while this number n this number n less than equal to 6. if this is the case then we just simply print what please enter number greater than 6 and then C in again number n right and after that simply we can do whatever you want to do or here simply I am printing thanks that's it right foreign I hope now you can see right whatever I have written here so now let's save this and let's run this so it is asking enter a number greater than six I am entering 3. please enter number greater than six I am entering 1. please enter number greater than 6 I'm entering seven so thanks so you can validate you can you know put some validation on user input with while loop now the assignment for you is suppose I want a number between not greater than 6 number between 2 and 7. this is the thing I want between two and seven so now you have to put what condition you will write in this while loop now think and write down so I hope you have tried this thing now what condition we'll put between two and seven between two and seven means you want three three four five six right so in while we can write down something like this number less than equal to 2 sorry less than equal to 2 or two condition you need to put logical or operator number greater than equal to 7. right it's not num we have taken a variable and only so that is why it is giving error Red Line because the variable name is n this condition you need to put if this is the case then we write try again or here you can write please enter valid number same thanks and then after that see out thanks right let me just run this and show you the output enter number between 2 and 7 see so I'm entering here eight please enter valid number one please enter valid number I'm entering 2 it is also not valid between 2 and 7 I want so I'm entering here five thanks so this is what you can do next thing what we can do suppose I want like end and here I want what C out enter a positive number okay start countdown fine C in and so here we can put one here what we can put condition in while loop while sorry we have to put semicolon here while this n greater than 0 then here we can print this number simply C out number right and for new line I'm just adding this time slash in and then n minus minus right and after that in C out we can do something like this let's celebrate right so let's run this and see what output you are getting here in this case so enter a positive number and start countdown so I'm entering a positive number five so five four three two one let's celebrate like 10 9 8 this type of countdown so this second example of using the swine Loop and another thing with help of flag also you can write down this type of program between 2 and 7. if you want to check this condition so with help you can take a flag variable like wool flag and with the help of that also you can put this type this type of condition so let's pause the video and try it this out so I hope you have tried this out let's try this we will take a variable Bool name of this variable I am taking flag and that first time it can take either value true or false because it is a Boolean type Bull type so first of all bull uh the flag is false and in while I am writing not flag not flag means it would be now true the condition is true and we are going to enter in this while loop so now we can put our condition if if n n what less than between two to seven we want less than equal to 2 for n greater than equal to 7 right so what we can write down here not a valid number okay this type of thing you can write down here find now else in else sorry we are not putting any condition here in else part we will write or we can simply write down thanks for entering a valid number right thanks plus this thing is really important the second line of else you have to set flag to what true okay one more thing we have to ask from the user to enter a number that thing we haven't written here so in this within this while we will ask C out enter number between 2 and 7. write this thing and then C in n then we put obviously the condition if number is less than equal to 2 or greater than 7 auto valid number else thanks and flag will set true okay now now let's run this and see what output you will get okay now enter number between 2 and 7 I'm entering five so it will just bring things and out let's run this again two and seven I am entering eight and not a valid number then again it will ask enter number between two and seven again I'm entering zero not a valid number enter number between two and seven now I'm entering three no thanks right so I hope you go to working let's see the working if suppose first of all flag is false not false is what true right so we will enter into this while loop now it will ask enter number between two and seven suppose we enter three so this condition is not true if condition so the control will enter into else part it will print things and now we have to get out of this while loop because you haven't heard a valid number right so that is why you have to put flag true now flag is true so now after else again check the condition control will go here while not flag now flag is true not flag means false so it condition becomes false so now we will exit from this while right that is why it is important to set this flag true if you will not put here true then this condition will always be true because flag would always be false not false means true so it would be an infinite Loop right so this line is very important I hope you got the importance of this line so I hope you got basics of while loop working syntax and everything right now what tricky things you can do with while loop right and you can say or properties of while loop or you can say different different ways in which you can write down while loop sometimes they ask this type of question like they'll give you a code snippet and what would be the answer of this thing just here in that code we have while loop but they do some tricky things with that while loop like they can put semicolon after a while loop or they can change some condition and maybe you haven't tried that thing with while loop because you simply traditional way you are writing while loop and that's it this is why Loop no many things you can do with while loop right so at that time you will get confused like you haven't tried that thing with while loop you will maybe you will say this will be better but that will give some output so those kind of things some coding exercises we'll be discussing in next video with the help of programs also so now it's in the next video till then bye bye take care
