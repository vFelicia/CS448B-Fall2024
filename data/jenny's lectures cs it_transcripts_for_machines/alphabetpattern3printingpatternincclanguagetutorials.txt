in the series of learning programming in ca we are discussing printing pattern programs in c so in this video i'll talk about how to print this pattern this alphabetic pattern right we'll see the logic on this whiteboard then i'll show the output on my laptop using vs code editor so i have discussed this kind of pattern in the previous video also there we have printed what a in second line also a b then abc abcd like this right now this is a little bit different from the previous pattern so first please check out the previous video then come to this video you will get it better now after checking out the previous video then you will get it better but here we are printing a in second line bb then c cc then d4 times then e5 times like this you can print multiple lines here i am taking only five lines right now if you want to take 5 10 15 lines then that also i'll show you when we'll discuss it on my laptop first you have to do you have to analyze the pattern and you have to divide it into number of rows and columns with the very first thing right now how many rows are there in this one two three four five rooms so i loop the outer loop would be run from one to five right so first thing the outer loop would be i is equal to 1 i less than equal to 5 and i plus plus right now within this outer loop inner loop would be to print these values means that would be responsible for these columns that is one two three four five that is j loop would be responsible for actual printing the inner loop right but now see when i value is one j is executing only one time when i value is two j is executing two times when i value three j is executing only three times because we are printing only in three columns these two are only space this is what trailing space we we don't have to print the trailing space right if the leading space is there means spaces before the the printing of these alphabets that should be taken care right that we will print that those kind of pattern also we'll discuss in separate video now see i hope you are getting my point now now inner loop would be executed from j is equal to 1 and j less than equal to what i right i hope you are getting this relation y j less than equal to i and j plus plus right now in inner loop what we will print now in printf see if i write this in a in a computer memory how this a value would be stored character system sky character system a is equal to equivalent to 65 and that would be converted into binary and that obviously binary numbers are stored in computer memory only zeros and one computer can understand right so if i if i write it something like this 65 66 66 67 because c would be 67 then 68 and then 69. right this is a b c d e like this 70 71 like this right sky values of these abcd's capital a b c ds small a b c ds are having different sky values now we have to print something like this now in first line 65 then 66 67 like like this but we are not printing actual integer value we are printing character values to print a character what should be the format specifier in printf percentage c you will not write here percentage d you will write percentage c right because we are not printing in teaser we are printing character now what you will print here this is a little bit different from the previous case here also we have only i and j or you can use some numbers you can some you can do some addition multiplication division you have to find out what you will you can write here right so now what i can print here if i write here something like this like 64 plus i or you can write i plus 64. it's up to you right and semicolon fine now that's it and in the outer loop what we will write post slash n sorry for the new line operator and that's it right now let me write on this program see see first of all i value becomes 1 would be initialized with 1 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition 2 will enter here now j would be initialized with 1 1 less than equal to y value is 1 yes condition 2 will enter here now printer percentage is 64 plus i 64 plus i value is 1 65 65 means you cannot print 65 because here format specifies percentage c means you should you should print means you have to print alphabet and corresponding to 65 alphabet is capital a so now capital a would be printed right j plus plus j becomes 2 is this condition true now no exit from the loop slash n means control will be in the next line right now i plus plus i becomes 2 now condition true 2 less than equal to 5 yes we will enter again here j would be again initialized with 1 now 1 less than equal to i value is now 2 yes condition 2 will again enter here now 64 plus i 64 plus 2 that is 66 corresponding to 66 we have character b b would be printed now j plus plus j is 2 2 less than equal to 2 yes condition 2 again enter here again what will print 64 plus i i value still 2 means 66 again b will be printed in the previous video we have written what 64 plus j because first time you are printing a then b right then first time j is 1 then 64 plus 1 second time 64 plus 2 right that is 66 that is why a b would be printed in that case but here we are writing i only because same character we are printing b and b same character we are printing c right so we cannot write down here j because j would be what first of all 1 then 2 then 3 so in 64 first of all 1 would be added then 2 then 3 but we don't want this we want only same character that is c so in 64 if we add the value of i 3 because in the third for the third row i value is same for this column also for this for this also so if we add i in 64 then every time when jlu would be repeated what same value would be added that is 3 and every time c would be printed right so i hope you got my point now why i am writing 64 plus i here now what j value is 2 again b would be printed j value is 3 not condition not true exit from the loop and in the new line now i plus plus i becomes 3 condition 2 will again enter here and this process would be repeat how many times 5 times right when i value becomes six condition not preview exit from the outer loop and five rows would be printed here i hope you got it now let me show you the output on my laptop using vs code editor so now let me create another file for this alphabet pattern three dot c right and this is actually same as the previous one so i'm i mean it's a little bit different so am just copying the previous code here the pattern one code here and whatever change you will do that i will show you here just to you know save the time let me just clear this terminal first of all the previous output now see in the first row i want to print a in second row b and b only then c c c only not abc right so for that what you have to change the outer loop would be same the inner loop condition would be same but here what we will print here rather than j plus 64 we are printing what i plus 64 because j value is changing 1 to 3 but i want only same character like b in second row c in third row that is why an i value would be same for those iterations right so that is why i am writing here i and let me just run this how many rows you want to print five see i guess this water pattern you need right now let me just run this again for uh 12 number of rows see i hope now you would have to print this pattern and if we run 4 how many suppose 30 number of rows here alphabets are only 26 but we are printing 30 rows here now till 26 it is printing alphabets till z and after that it is printing the characters which is corresponding to the sky value which is computed by i plus 64 right so this these are the characters that are printed here now i hope you got these printing pattern programs so i hope you got it now i'll see you in the next video with a new part until then bye bye take
