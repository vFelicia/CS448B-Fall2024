so in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing 2D arrays in C we have discussed like everything about 2D arrays reason why we are using 2D arrays declaration initialization memory representation and how to access 2D arrays so now we will discuss some two or three programs about 2D arrays right basically 2D arrays uh are used to what to you know uh do some operations on metrics so you can also write like 2D as a matrix you can also you know consider it something like this so in this video I'll disc first of all a simple program we'll take or you can say we will read a 2d array or a matrix you can say then we'll print that 2D array and then also we calculate sum of all the elements whatever you will enter in that Matrix or in that 2D array right first of all we'll see the logic here on the Whiteboard then we'll do practical also I'll show you the output on my laptop right let's discuss the logic to print a 2d array first of all we will read a 2d array right so like this I'm de laring suppose a 2d aray like in a and 2 and 3 only a small 2D bring here you can take three four or any size right and for entering we will use obviously what four Loops two four Loops so I'm going to declare two variables for using the those four Loops so first read a 2d array using two for Loops one for row like this we are going to represent this one row 0 1 index 0 1 2 these are columns right two and three two rows and three colums this is a column size right so now first Loop would be what I Loop would be to read rows how many rows are there but now Within These rows also we are having columns so this this J Loop would read the actual values right of these columns so two Loops would be required that is next Loops would be required here I = to 0 I less than this is for row and row size is 2 so I less than 2 it should run for two uh two times only with than this the loop would be for column J is zero J less than how many columns three so less than three and j++ three times it would run right and how to read data using scanner function percentage D and address of a of I and G this is how we can read data that that sentex we have already discussed in my previous videos right scan of synx I hope you are familiar uh familiar with the scan of synx here we are using what two subscript I and J one for row and one for column right now we have entered suppose values here the working of these Loops also I have discussed in previous videos so I'm not know know discussing the working of this for we'll also we will only discuss the working of the four those for we will use for printing the 2D array and calculating the sum this thing we have already discussed so you can check out the previous videos so suppose I have entered some values like this 10 1 3 0 2 and 5 these values I have entered now calculate sum and print this Matrix or print this 2D array and I want to print in this pattern only like 10 1 3 0 2 5 this should be the not it's like 10 1 3 0 2 54 in one line no I don't want that kind of output and this format only I want in Matrix format right so you have to take care of this thing also 10 then some space then minus one then space then three in the next line next row right so this is this form I want output and also then sum of this so how to print obviously two for Loops right we are going to access these elements so one for row and one for column so same Loop would be from Outer Loop would be 0 to two then within this J would be 0 to 3 see need of the for Loops also we have discussed if you are not aware if you're not clear that why I'm using these kind of for Loop nexted for Loop what is the reason behind this you you must go and check out the video that I'll put in the description box of this video sorry the IE button of this uh this video so you can check out here the link I'll provide here right so now for printing purpose we will use print a function right and here I'm not printing or maybe you can print first of all and see how to access how to print this one array name in first subscript I and in second we have j i and J one for row and one for column right and here only we are calculating sum also so how to calculate sum same formula as we have discussed in 1D aray sum plus we will add these one so a of I and J and whatever the sum that you will store in a sum variable right and at last we can print the sum so before using the sum also you have to declare it and also we will initialize with a zero if you will not initialize it with a zero it will you know take some garbage value and then it will not give you the correct output because garbage Value Plus this data some garbage value you will get right so now okay but see now if you simply write this thing and suppose after this four loop after these four Loops Su has been calculated within this for loop after this for Loop we will print some sum so sum equal to percentage D and sum that's it but see here are some mistakes also we will correct those mistakes but let me dry run this first then you will get those mistakes better right now when compiler will go come here here we will write main function and within the main function this thing so size would be declared three for six elements right like this not like this this is how we see the size would be located but that would be in linear form either row measure or in colum me form one variable I one variable J one is sum sum is having zero and I and J are having some garbage value right and suppose this is our address of this is let me show you how this this is to be stored in memory actually I hope you are clear with this memory representation we have discussed in the previous video so you can check out that video right so this is how actually memory to memory is to be allocated to this two to this two uh Matrix first of all the first row would be stored and then the second row would be stored like this right so now I hope this working of these for Loop the scanner function is clear I have entered this data now this for Loop for I is equal to 0 okay I would be initial zero condition true enter here J would be zero condition enter here now print F percentage D what a of I I is zero J is also zero so a of 0 0 a of 0 0 means this data would be printed right this is a of 0 0 row is 0 column is also 0 0 0 this is 0 1 this is 02 this is 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 right so this would be existed and 10 would be printed so 10 would be printed right I'm printing here only 10 10 would be printed then sum is equal to Su plus A5 whatever the value in sum sum is 0 plus A5 a i j a i j is i 0 0 that is 10 0 + 10 that would be stored in sum so here in sum now we have 10 right now we are in this inner for Loop so now j++ so J becomes what now one condition two enter again now again print F A of0 and now J is 1 so if 0 1 is this one so minus one would be printed without any space but I want in a matrix form so I think you should want a space here some space so that would be what you can use here/ T tab so after this percentage you can directly write down SLT Within These Braes Within These codes quotes right so whatever in these double quotes that would be printed on the screen as it is but one have percentage D only that would be replaced by the value here after this comma and then SLT means tab so tab means a space would be printed here and then minus one would be printed right so this is what you have to do one more thing you have to do that also we discuss now see again sum plus a of I now sum is 10 so 10 + a of 0 and 1 1 0 1 is 1 so 10 + 1 that is 9 so 9 would be updated here again j++ now J becomes two condition true yes again enter here again print one tab space a of zero and now J is 2 02 is this one so three would be printed now sum plus this one now sum is 9 so 9 + a of 0 2 J is 2 9 + 3 that is 2 12 so now in sum we have 12 right j++ now J becomes three condition not true yes exit from the inner loop and in the outer loop still we are in this Loop so I ++ so now I becomes one condition true 1 less than two again enter here again J would be initialized with zero right so that would be for the next column sorry the next row right now again condition true enter here now see how percentage d/t means tab would be printed and a of now I value is 1 and J value is zero at this point I value is 1 1 and J is zero so 1 Z means 1 and zero this value would be printed here only but I want that should be printed in next line right so after printing the complete Row one slashing we require for new line and uh this for Loop the inner for Loop is responsible to print the complete row so after completing the inner loop inner for Loop you want to print a slash n within this outer for Loop right so after this inner loop here right simply after this inner loop here simply you can write print F /n and this should be in this outer loop right not with out out of this outer loop after that we will close this outer loop so after this what whatever the line exit from this inner loop When J becomes three whatever the line after this Loop that would be executed that is sln so now control is here cursor is here and now I ++ so I becomes one so now whatever the value at 1 Z that that will be printed here now again j++ J becomes one and I hope you can see how this you are able to now see how this is to be the working of this Loop Printing and sound right now again one and one so here one and one this data would be accessed that is two would be printed and now in sum two again plus two like this some would be calculated so you dry run this you yourself dry run this program completely right before jumping to your laptop right and see what sum you you are getting and how it is printing here right so I hope that this dryon of this is clear so now after after this for loop after printing of this and we have calculated sum then we are going to print sum percentage D whatever the value in the sum variable that would be printed so I hope it's clear to you so now let me show you this practically so so now let me create one file for you I'm writing print 2D array right do c please ignore my naming of the programs right header file and uh then we will write down what main function and here we will take one array array of uh three and suppose I'm writing three or take same areay two and three you can change the size according to you once you get the logic I then one variable is a j and one sum that is initialize with uh zero and I'm just writing down enter elements of 2D array right uh so in the for Loop we'll use outer for Loop would be for the row so less than two and I ++ and now inner four Loop would be for columns so to 0 to 3 and j++ and within this we will use what scanf to take input percentage D and then address of a of I and J right so that's it now we are going to print right so now before writing before writing the for Loop I'm just writing what print F or you can write here rather than 2D array you can write down here metric enter element of a matrix right so I'm just printing here Matrix is right and the new line so now I'm just uh you know I'm just copying the four Loops these four Loops because condition would be same 0 to two and in would be 0 to 3 rather than this scanner we will write what print F percentage D here we write a/t Tab and syntax would be this one and then we will do sum sum is equal to a of I and uh J right and I guess that's it after the inner for Loop one more line we will write that is what slash and after the for loop after for Loop we will just print the sum sum equal to percentage D it should be next line so better to use a slash in Comma just write sum and slashing I hope it will work let me just run this so it will ask uh what the number of elements of a matrix it should ask I don't know it will ask or not yeah ENT the element of Matrix so I'm entering and elements like uh 1 then 2 1 3 4 4 5 C Matrix is 1 2 1 that is first row then 3 4 5 that is second row and sum is five okay here the problem is I have written sum is equal to sum is equal to see so two equal TOS it should be sum plus yeah now let me just run this again so enter the elements here again I'm entering 1 then 2 1 4 3 2 and see 1 2 1 First Row 4 3 2 second row and now sum is 11 so 2 + 1 3 3 3 6 and 10 12 1 yeah some is sum is 11 so now it's correct right so now this is how you can print a matrix of any size 3 into 3 3 into 4 5 into 5 any size you can take here so from the next video we'll see some more program on metrix so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
