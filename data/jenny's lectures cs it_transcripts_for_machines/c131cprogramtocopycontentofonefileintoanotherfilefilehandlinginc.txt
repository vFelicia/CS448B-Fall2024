so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing some programs on file handling in c in the previous video we have discussed a program in which you are supposed to count number of lines in a text file right in this video we will discuss a program in which you are supposed to copy a content of one file into another file right we have some content in one file and we want to copy the that content that content of that file to another one right so that thing will discuss here first of all we will write in that program in line by line i am going to discuss that program then i'll show you output like i'm going to show you practical also on my laptop right now before this one really one thing as we know gate 2022 exam is going on so here an academy is conducting live sessions for this gate exam analysis and this analysis will be done by the top educators of gate and esc and they are going to discuss solution of all the questions so that you can analyze how many questions you would write about your rank and the score you know your gate score everything the best part is you can take these live sessions for free you just have to enroll the enrollment link you will find in the description box for this video and for gate 2023 and 2024 aspirants they are also going to start new batches in these batches their top educators will be covering all the subjects of cs and id and in this course you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts plus you can get all your doubt cleared in a separate doubt clearing sessions but these are paid subscription because here you will get complete and structured course right but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on these paid subscriptions and an academy is also offering you a super combo offer in which if you buy two years of gate and esc subscription you will get extra one year free subscription for campus placement and id jobs and if you buy one year of gate and esc subscription you will get six month subscription free for campus placement and i t jobs and here also if you will use my code jkl then you will get extra 10 off so the price detail you can see on my screen so all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let discuss what how to write down a program to copy content of one file into another one see here i have suppose one file abc.txt and in this file i have some content like hi hello we have jenny's lectures this is the content i have in this file so i want to copy this content into another file suppose another file is i am taking destination destination.txt and here i want to copy the content of this hi hello jenny's lectures then how you will do this right so first of all you are supposed to the right method is now first of all you have to understand the question right what is being asked then try to think the logic right how you will write down that program and then start writing program it's not like that just you know read the line yeah copy content of a file to another one and start writing program no understand the question first completely if you have any doubt you can ask from your faculty or anyone then you know start thinking logic that how you will do this see this content if you want i want to copy to this first of all obviously we are going to read this file read means we are going to open this file in read mode and here i am going to write this content copy means obviously we are going to write so you are supposed to read you are supposed to open this file into w mode i think it is clear to you fine now character by character there can be many methods one method is character by character i'm reading this file and i'm copying that character into this first of all i'll read h i will copy h here then i then i here then slash n okay slash and then again h h e l o like this till end of five once i reach to end of five out or you can say exit from the loop obviously we yeah you know you need to use some loop here one one by one character i am reading so you will put that logic into a loop for while or do worrying which you are comfortable you can write down that one that loop that's it this is the logic now how you will write down that thing in a program you are just supposed to run a loop from here to end of file and you are copying character by character here to fetch a character you will use f get c you know the syntax right to write something here to write a character you will use f put c that's it this is the simple logic and now you are supposed to write down this thing in a program right so how you will write c so how many file pointer you will need what for this file one for this file one file pointer can handle only one file it's not like that this one you know would be sufficient for both the files no one file pointer for this one for this so fptr1 fptr2 right now obviously we will read a character so you are supposed to take a variable in which you are going to store that thing right now open this file into read mode so how you will open fptr 1 is equal to using f open function f open name is abc.txt and i am going to open this into read mode and here you can check if fptr1 equal to equal to null then cannot open file or you can say error error while opening the file and exit from this point right same same line you will write down for this file right obviously you are supposed you you need to open this file also to write something into this file right so same we will write f ptr 2 is equal to f open and the name is i am taking suppose destination destination dot txt and you need to open this file into write mode right so if file does not exist it's okay it will create a new file in right mode obviously that is the thing i hope now you are clear with this these modes because we have discussed these modes so it will create a destination.txt file but that would be blank same i guess you can write down this thing these three lines here if they send this if fptr2 is equal to null printf error while opening this file in exit right we cannot open this file because of some error right so you will check this thing after this what logic you will write now read this file character by character so i am writing a while loop here while i am i am fetching a character using f get c obviously this function you need to use f g c and here i am passing f ptr one the file pointer are two so you need to take care which file pointer is for this fptr one right fptr1 and whatever character you will fetch you need to store that character so i am taking a variable c right till till end of file once character is end of file stop so the condition would be this character not equal to end of 5 till then we are going to run this loop once the character is end of 5 exit from the loop right now in this loop i hope you go to the condition why i am writing this condition right this is very simple now in this case now you are supposed to write down the logic of copying this content into this one or to write this whatever character you have fetched to write this character into this description file so what which function you need to use f put c right and here character is character would be in c this variable and in which file you are going to copy f ptr 2 this is the file pointer for this file right that's it now character by character it is going to open and once uf exit from the loop so after this i am going to write printf uh you can write down a message like successfully copy the content such type of message you can write down f close f p t r 1 and f close f p t r 2 or before writing the sprint f also you can close this thing right these pointers i hope now you got this logic base this is very simple right now successfully suppose we have opened this file so f get c will fetch one character from fptr1 fptr one is pointing to this one so it will fetch h now see the character is h right in c variable we have h so care h is not equal to end of phi yes condition true so enter into this loop f put c now in c we have h right so now put this h into fptr2 fptr2 is pointing to this file so h this h would be written into this file again next character is i this is also not equal to endo file so again enter into this and write i here next is slash n this is not also end of file so it will write slash and here so next content would be hello till hello and after that after that this becomes endo file so now end of file end of file not equal to end of i no condition is not true so exit from this while loop and just print successfully copied once you will open this file you will get this content right or if suppose you want to read this content then also that thing also you can do but for that thing you need to open this file into w plus mode that is for both reading and writing because if you open this file in write mode you cannot read this content you can only write right so the opening mode you need to take care which function or which thing you want to do with the file according to that you need to open that file in that mode only right so if you want to read that content also then open it into w plus mode right and then you can write down the logic of reading like a while loop and that's it while loop till end of file end of this file file pointer to and for reading you can just read fetch this character by character like fdxc you can use it i think you can do that logic by yourself or you can now this is you can say assignment for you right now you have to read the content of this file also fine so this is a program in this program i have created c two file pointer fptr one and two right and then we have taken our variable characters but i'm taking ch right now i'm opening this file fptr1 abc.txt into read mode right and i'm checking if this is null no file or you can say error while opening up i can exit from this point now fptr2 also i'm opening this destination.txt file into write mode right see in my pc i don't have destination.txt file so it's okay if you are opening this into write mode it will create a new file also that's it but if i don't if file doesn't exist and you are opening that file into read mode then it will return null right obviously because file is not there it is not going to create a new file right but in write mode it's okay to create destination.txt right because i in my pci only this fb0 txt5 in this folder right so now if ptr2 is also null then no file and exit from here otherwise just write down the logic like while this i am fetching a single character cs is equal to fbc pt from fptr1 and the condition is not equal to n25 till then then simply write f put c and the variable i am taking here in this case is ch and fptr2 because we are writing we are copying the content into second phi a ptr2 file right then close fptr one and two and then you can just write down the logic like you can write down the line like successfully copied that's it now let me just run this and show you first of all what is this in this abc dot txt file see here i have welcome hi welcome to jenny's lectures and we are discussing some programs on file ending in c this is our content right so let me just run this and show you see here successfully copied so now here also we have one new file that is destination destination.txt let me just open this file and show you what is there see this is the file destination.txt see in this file also we have the same content right if suppose in abc dot txt file nothing this is the content hi welcome to jenny's lectures right now let me just run this again and show you see now in destination also hi welcome to jenny's lecture so this is how you can copy the content to one one file into another file there can be another method also but here we are using we are you know discussing only one method like reading character by character and writing that character into second file other methods i i think you got the logic so you can write down this program with other you know methods also maybe you are reading the complete string not a character a complete string that's it that is also fine so now you can do those variation by yourself right now that's it for this video so in the next video we'll discuss one more program on file handling soon i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
