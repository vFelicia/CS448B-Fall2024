00:00 - hi this groups patch this is so cool I
00:02 - wanted to share it with you
00:04 - so scratched - he has come and you might
00:07 - have known in the past that scratch to
00:08 - let you write extensions but they were
00:10 - really far away in scratch X and hardly
00:14 - anybody was able to see them we
00:16 - scratched three the plugins are kind of
00:19 - much more integrated with scratch like
00:22 - the pen blocks even might have noticed
00:23 - they're now part of the scratch
00:26 - extensions as are lots of other parts of
00:29 - scratch it used to be just native parts
00:31 - of scratch so when you write a scratch
00:34 - extension now they're much more
00:35 - integrated and this has let me write a
00:37 - little extension which of course you
00:39 - can't get hold of at the moment who
00:40 - knows what might happen in the future
00:41 - but here is a physics extension so I've
00:45 - added one in here look as with patch
00:47 - tests in the extensions and when it's
00:49 - added in what I've done is I've set up a
00:51 - whole Atta sprites these have got no
00:53 - scripts in whatsoever they're just
00:55 - placed on the screen like that
00:57 - the main cat has got one script called
01:00 - enable physics for all sprites and the
01:02 - loop saying step physics simulation and
01:05 - that's now running what I have here is
01:09 - when this collector sprite is clicked
01:11 - push with force simply v in a certain
01:14 - direction and that's attached to the cat
01:16 - so when I click the cat it's gonna apply
01:19 - a force to the cat now watch this okay
01:23 - physics in scratch I love it look at
01:29 - that and it's all done using these
01:36 - blocks so the integration is great
01:38 - because it means I can draw the shapes
01:40 - if I go click a new Y right I've drawn I
01:42 - can just import one so if I import in
01:44 - this little cherry here like this one my
01:47 - project there it goes it's all ready to
01:51 - go I can drag things around all my
01:55 - simulations are running and it takes the
02:00 - shape of the object from the convex hull
02:02 - which is already done for us in scratch
02:04 - so it's kind of useful
02:07 - and they go so you can write these
02:08 - projects if I load a different one
02:11 - here's another one I was working on with
02:14 - llamas and and delicious Mexican tasty
02:19 - things and a big apple and you can see
02:21 - so they're all simulating in physics and
02:24 - you don't really like much in scratch to
02:27 - get it to work just the main game part
02:28 - and then the physics take take control
02:30 - of the rest what you love to have a go
02:33 - with that so who knows at some point
02:36 - hopefully I'll be able to put a demo on
02:39 - the web you can have a play with but it
02:41 - doesn't half make for a lot of fun I
02:43 - really hope that scratch 3 will start
02:46 - allowing some of these extensions to be
02:48 - played with wouldn't that be fun
