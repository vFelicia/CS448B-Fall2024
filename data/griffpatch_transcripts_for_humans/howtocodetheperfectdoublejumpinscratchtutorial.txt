00:02 - hello fellow scratchers I'm Griff patch
00:05 - and today I'm going to show you how to
00:07 - add double jumping to your scratch games
00:09 - and specifically to our classic scratch
00:11 - Platformers of course but hold on
00:14 - there's actually a bit more to this that
00:16 - first meets the eye so let's take a
00:19 - detailed look at the rules that govern
00:21 - double
00:23 - jumping firstly the player must have
00:26 - already jumped into the air that is they
00:29 - can't just run off a platform and jump
00:31 - as they fall that would be a b jump and
00:34 - we are coding double jumps next the
00:37 - player has to release the jump key and
00:40 - press it a second time this is what
00:42 - triggers our beautiful double jump but
00:46 - can the player just keep on jumping no
00:48 - no we must keep of how many jumps the
00:51 - player has made and limit jumps do only
00:54 - do until that is they touch the ground
00:57 - once more finally what if they W jump
01:02 - well in that case perhaps we might allow
01:04 - them another double jump but the choice
01:06 - is up to
01:07 - us well I think that pretty much sums it
01:10 - all up so open up your projects from
01:12 - where we left off and save them as a
01:14 - fresh new copy guys let's get
01:19 - scratching now a few people have pointed
01:21 - out that perhaps we don't have so much
01:23 - room on our screens to allow for a lot
01:26 - of jumping around let alone double
01:28 - jumping well guys that really depends on
01:31 - the size of your player character
01:32 - doesn't it we can easily shrink them
01:35 - down a little smaller for example to 30%
01:38 - a aren't they cute and then if we want
01:41 - we can compress our levels to fit more
01:43 - platforms on one screen at this size
01:46 - though we would benefit to play around
01:48 - with gravity and the jump Force to make
01:51 - our new player size feel right I'm
01:53 - actually going to increase gravity
01:55 - though to -2 to give my player a fast
01:58 - jump Arc and that automatically reduces
02:01 - the maximum jump height so yeah I love
02:04 - how that feels see how I can no longer
02:06 - jump high enough to reach the jump
02:08 - through platform either now my screen
02:11 - recording is lagging a bit here I think
02:13 - it's because we have so many scripts on
02:15 - this first Sprite to make things a
02:17 - little smoother while looking inside the
02:19 - project you can create a blank Sprite
02:22 - and drop it in as the first Sprite in
02:24 - your game you might have seen that on
02:25 - some scratch projects with this Sprite
02:27 - selected things tend to run just a
02:29 - little little smoother yeah that's
02:32 - better so where to begin in the jump
02:36 - code I guess we can follow the scripts
02:38 - under the tick player we have the
02:40 - controls up and down script okay this is
02:43 - where we detect the jump key the up
02:45 - arrow in my case and then we have two
02:48 - jump triggers the first for wall jumping
02:51 - and the second one is for regular jumps
02:53 - we're going to need a third so by this
02:56 - time it may be obvious but we need to
02:58 - split this script up using a custom
03:00 - block pull out everything under the key
03:03 - press and we'll make a new block naming
03:06 - it start a new Jump question mark just
03:10 - pop those scripts under that Define
03:12 - block and make use of the new block
03:14 - right away from where the scripts were
03:17 - pulled except now look at this both the
03:20 - if conditions that can start a new Jump
03:22 - are checking whether jump is zero this
03:25 - value tells us how long we've been
03:27 - holding down the jump key it's only zero
03:29 - when the jump is first pressed but since
03:32 - they are both using this check we'll
03:34 - take it out of here and using a new if
03:36 - block surrounding the start new Jump pop
03:39 - the jump equals z condition in there
03:43 - that makes sense we can't start a new
03:45 - Jump of any kind unless this is the
03:47 - initial press of the jump key now hold
03:50 - on what about this last if down here
03:53 - this isn't checking for a jump of zero
03:55 - and with good reason this is not to
03:57 - handle the start of a jump but the
03:59 - continuation of a jump so move that off
04:02 - the end of the script and put it back
04:05 - under the if jumping here make sure it's
04:08 - not inside jumping if
04:11 - okay few lastly we tidy up these ifs the
04:16 - first only checks for wall jumps wall
04:18 - sliding and the second only tests for
04:21 - falling being less than three that
04:23 - allows for standard non- delayed coyote
04:25 - jumps so we're almost there one last
04:29 - touch just just to be safe pop in a stop
04:32 - this script at the end of both of these
04:34 - ifs to ensure only one jump action
04:37 - doesn't leak into the next by mistake
04:40 - great so all these changes and we should
04:43 - have made no difference to our Gameplay
04:46 - at all but it is a lot neater and will
04:49 - make adding new Jump types far easier
04:52 - Let's test smash that green flag and
04:55 - give your game a good run through or a
04:58 - jump through in this case as we should
05:00 - test all possible jumping scenarios that
05:02 - we might have accidentally broken if
05:04 - you're interested then the official term
05:06 - for this is regression testing testing
05:09 - to see if we broke something that was
05:11 - previously working so next to allow
05:14 - double jumps we need to keep count of
05:17 - the number of jumps our player has made
05:20 - make a new variable jump count for this
05:23 - Sprite only and then in the regular
05:27 - jumping code down at the bottom here
05:29 - simply change jump count by one he hey
05:34 - that wasn't rocket science but it's
05:36 - oddly
05:37 - satisfying but for double jumps we are
05:40 - only interested in how many jumps were
05:42 - made since we last touched the ground so
05:46 - find with me the define collide y
05:49 - ceiling or floor
05:51 - script floor collisions are detected
05:53 - when falling is greater than zero so
05:56 - reset the jump counter by setting it to
05:59 - zero
06:00 - well that was easy and you'll notice
06:02 - that we can no longer ever get this
06:04 - counter greater than one it's zero or
06:07 - one or zero or one yeah but now we have
06:11 - the data we need to trigger that second
06:13 - jump we need to go back and find our new
06:16 - defined stter new Jump script and we'll
06:20 - introduce a new type of jump that's a
06:23 - new if but we can duplicate the last one
06:26 - for ease and the condition we are
06:28 - looking for is simply that jump count is
06:31 - equal to one that means the player is in
06:34 - the middle of their first jump and now
06:37 - we will trigger a second jump just as
06:40 - easy as that notice however that jump
06:43 - count gets increased to two and thus we
06:46 - won't be able to make any further jumps
06:49 - until we touch the ground again smash
06:51 - the green
06:52 - flag oh wow look at this we did it
06:56 - double jumping and it's really good so
06:59 - responsive and with a very solid
07:01 - implementation that just worked so well
07:05 - it's worth testing this out all over
07:07 - your levels to see how it affects your
07:09 - game at present we don't Grant the
07:12 - player a double jump after wall jumping
07:14 - which I think we probably should but
07:16 - also before we scroll away from here do
07:19 - consider that if you want to Grant the
07:21 - double jump ability as a power up all we
07:24 - would need to do is add an extra
07:25 - condition to this if to say something
07:27 - like jump count equals 1 and
07:30 - say the abilities list contains the word
07:32 - double jump and you'd be good to go what
07:36 - we want to do though is allow double
07:37 - jumps after a wall jump so scrolling up
07:40 - to the top of this script which is the
07:41 - bit that handles wall jumping all we
07:43 - need to do is set jump count to one then
07:47 - we'll still be able to trigger a double
07:48 - jump right after a wall jump well job
07:52 - done now we can go to town and make the
07:54 - most of this new jumping power what do
07:57 - you think do you like it perhaps it
07:59 - would be cool to add a little particle
08:01 - effect under the player as they double
08:03 - jump a cloud or something anyway I leave
08:06 - that to you ingenious coders to figure
08:08 - that one out if you want to give it a
08:10 - go so if you've enjoyed this lesson Mash
08:14 - that like button and subscribe to the
08:16 - channel making sure to check the Bell
08:18 - icon because you're going to just love
08:20 - what I have in store for the next
08:22 - episode player crouching and sliding oh
08:26 - man yeah but I'm afraid that's all we've
08:28 - got time for today so thanks for
08:30 - watching have a great week ahead and
08:33 - scratch on guys
