00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers
00:04 - i'm griff patch and in this part 13 of
00:06 - our tiled scrolling platformer series
00:08 - we are going to complete the work we
00:10 - started on our level editor
00:12 - and also bring in some new fun tiles to
00:14 - enhance our levels
00:15 - then to complete the episode we're going
00:17 - to squeeze in some basic level
00:19 - progression
00:19 - scripts yes we will be able to get to
00:22 - level two
00:24 - now if you've been following along from
00:26 - week to week and don't already have the
00:28 - orange platforming tiles in your project
00:30 - then you'll find them along with other
00:32 - new costumes in the updated asset
00:34 - project on my griffbatch tutor account
00:36 - as always there's a link under the video
00:39 - so
00:39 - let's open that up now and we'll simply
00:42 - backpack the entire
00:43 - tile sprite and the enemy sprite
00:49 - now my backpack is nice and empty you
00:51 - can keep it like this
00:52 - by right-clicking on items you don't
00:54 - want anymore and deleting them from your
00:56 - backpack
00:57 - good to know okay we can now open up our
01:01 - personal tile scrolling projects
01:03 - this would be a good time to make a
01:05 - backup using the file
01:07 - save as copy it's good practice to keep
01:09 - doing this especially between episodes
01:13 - right open your backpack and drag out
01:16 - the
01:16 - enemy and the tiles sprite
01:19 - this will result in us having an enemy 2
01:21 - and a tiles 2 sprite
01:24 - let's start with the tiles 2 sprite if
01:27 - we check out the new costumes
01:29 - oh yeah here we go the first new costume
01:32 - is the bush
01:33 - at costume 31. if i switch to the
01:36 - original tile sprite
01:38 - i'll just confirm that the last costume
01:39 - we had before was the mushroom at
01:42 - costume 30.
01:43 - yeah there it is i hope that's the same
01:46 - for you
01:47 - so we can start copying these new
01:48 - costumes from tiles 2
01:50 - into the original tile sprite one at a
01:52 - time
01:53 - counting as we go
02:02 - yep all the way to costumes 48 and
02:06 - 49. next
02:09 - we'll check out the costumes of our
02:10 - original enemy sprite
02:12 - okay the last one is another mushroom
02:16 - yeah it's costume number 21. click into
02:19 - the enemy 2 sprite
02:20 - and yes costume 21 is also a mushroom
02:24 - so let's begin copying costumes 22
02:27 - and up into the original enemy sprite 22
02:31 - 23 24 and costume 25
02:34 - and that's it i'm looking forward to
02:37 - making use of these costumes aren't you
02:39 - these are for the end of level
02:41 - progression later on in the video
02:42 - so stick around for that just checking
02:46 - that those costumes are all there in the
02:48 - enemy sprite
02:49 - great so we can safely delete the tiles
02:52 - 2 and
02:52 - enemy 2 sprites make sure you delete the
02:55 - right ones
02:56 - we don't want a disaster at this point
02:59 - do we
03:00 - our next job is to configure all the
03:02 - list data required by these sprites
03:05 - click into the editor sprite
03:10 - and make the tile key map list visible
03:13 - also the tile shape list and the tile
03:16 - groups list do you remember what each of
03:19 - these is for
03:20 - don't worry i'll go over these again
03:22 - quickly as we update each one
03:25 - start by clicking into the tiles sprite
03:28 - and enter the costume editor
03:31 - so our first list is the keymap list
03:34 - and this lets us assign a number key to
03:37 - a costume
03:37 - for use in the level editor then when we
03:40 - press that number key
03:42 - we can paint with that costume numbers 1
03:45 - to four have been used for the normal
03:46 - blocks
03:47 - and key nine is for enemies we'll start
03:50 - at row 31 then
03:52 - that's the new bush costume assign that
03:55 - to key number two
03:57 - and the same for the cloud platform key2
04:00 - next up we have the orange platforms all
04:03 - the way up to costume41
04:06 - these can be set to key 3 just like our
04:09 - blue costumes were
04:10 - so yes enter a 3 for each row from 33
04:14 - to 41 then we have four
04:17 - pipe costumes i'll enter these as keys
04:20 - one
04:20 - for rows 42 43 44
04:24 - and 45. right now
04:27 - this star will be an enemy just like the
04:29 - new mushroom was
04:31 - so give it a key of nine and
04:34 - the same for the end box costume it
04:37 - should be treated as an enemy
04:38 - key nine the last two costumes are
04:41 - background tiles
04:43 - and key two will be fine for these i
04:45 - think
04:47 - the next list is the tile shapes list
04:50 - that is used to let our project know
04:52 - which tiles are solid
04:54 - which are platforms and which are not
04:56 - solid at all that is we can walk through
04:57 - them
04:58 - we start at row 32 this is the cloud
05:02 - platform
05:03 - it acts the same as the top of a drop
05:04 - through platform so
05:06 - we enter an equal symbol for that
05:09 - oh look the next three tiles are also
05:11 - the tops of platforms
05:13 - so rows 33 34 and 35 are also equals
05:17 - the rest of the platforms don't count as
05:19 - solid so we can skip through these
05:22 - but the pipe that will be fully solid
05:24 - for the time being
05:26 - so make rows until row 42 in the list
05:30 - and then enter a hash and the same for
05:33 - rows 43 44 and 45 2. that's four hashes
05:37 - and that's it for the solid list so on
05:40 - to the tile group list
05:42 - this was new in the last episode and it
05:44 - was used for the tile
05:46 - auto arranging scripts we use it to
05:49 - group tile costumes that should auto
05:51 - arrange
05:52 - that will apply to the new orange
05:54 - platforms and the pipes
05:56 - i'll just check what group numbers we've
05:58 - already used
06:00 - okay so one and two only so let's use
06:03 - three for the yellow platforms start at
06:06 - row 33 and
06:07 - enter the group numbers of 3 for all the
06:09 - rows up to row 41
06:11 - like this
06:17 - the pipes are next these can be group 4.
06:20 - we'll set rows 42 43
06:22 - 44 and 45 to 4.
06:26 - now we could create a group for these
06:29 - black
06:29 - end tiles here but i don't want to bore
06:32 - you to death so i'm leaving them a b
06:34 - because next up we have to enter the
06:36 - costume recipes
06:37 - oh my i need to make the recipe list
06:40 - visible by going into the editor sprite
06:42 - again
06:43 - and we want the tile recipes list i'll
06:46 - make it nice and big
06:47 - and then go back to the tiles costume
06:49 - editor to see the costumes we are
06:51 - configuring
06:53 - we're starting with costume 33 again now
06:56 - if you need to remember how these codes
06:58 - work then please go back and watch part
07:00 - 12 again because
07:01 - we went into a lot of detail there on
07:03 - how to set these up
07:04 - i did it all again and i'm just going to
07:07 - give you the numbers
07:08 - are you ready the orange platforms
07:10 - starting at costume 33
07:12 - row 33 just enter zero one one zero
07:16 - space zero one zero zero
07:19 - row thirty four enter zero one one one
07:23 - space zero zero one zero space
07:26 - zero zero zero zero space zero one zero
07:30 - one now row thirty five we have
07:34 - zero zero one one zero zero zero one
07:38 - row thirty six enter one one one zero
07:41 - row thirty seven enter one one one one
07:45 - row 38 enter one zero one one
07:49 - and finally row thirty nine enter one
07:51 - one zero
07:52 - zero i'll just scroll down a bit
07:56 - okay row 40 enter one one zero one
08:00 - and space and a one zero zero zero
08:04 - and row forty one enter one zero zero
08:07 - one now the pipes starting at costume 42
08:12 - row 42 enter 0 1 1 0
08:16 - space 0 1 0 0
08:19 - row 43 we enter 0 0 1 1
08:23 - space 0 0 zero one
08:26 - row forty four enter one one one zero
08:30 - space one one zero zero
08:33 - and lastly row forty five we enter
08:36 - one zero one one space one zero zero
08:40 - one for you
08:43 - if you find things are not connecting up
08:45 - after this just rewind the video and
08:47 - check these numbers again okay
08:49 - now i can hide these lists from the
08:51 - editor sprite and we'll give the project
08:53 - a run
08:55 - oh no music i've muted my audio i hope
08:58 - you don't mind
08:59 - now enter the level editor with the zero
09:01 - key
09:03 - press the number one key until you find
09:05 - the new green pipe
09:07 - let's place down these tiles they
09:10 - certainly look great when you make a
09:11 - perfect two-tile wide column
09:14 - love how the floor also self-arranges
09:16 - around them that's beautiful
09:18 - but i want to also show you a limitation
09:20 - we have not accounted for
09:22 - in our tile layouts placing a second
09:25 - pipe next to an existing one throws our
09:27 - layout
09:28 - engine into chaos it doesn't know what
09:30 - to do
09:31 - as soon as we split them apart from each
09:33 - other they perfectly reassemble
09:36 - so what's going on here well our tile
09:39 - arranger
09:40 - only works with solid blocks of tiles
09:43 - the pipes
09:44 - flush up against each other are
09:46 - therefore treated as a single mass of
09:48 - pipe not two single pipes and so the
09:51 - tile arranger doesn't know how to draw
09:52 - that
09:53 - let's start afresh press the three key
09:56 - and look at the blue
09:57 - and orange platforms now i'm loving how
10:00 - the platforms reassemble as we paint
10:02 - them over each other
10:03 - it's really neat but again there is an
10:06 - issue here
10:07 - if you saw how we use these platforms we
10:09 - actually want the orange platform to
10:11 - appear to be
10:12 - in front of the blue platform with the
10:15 - blue platform looking to stay behind
10:17 - not be rearranged to sit together like
10:19 - this
10:20 - so we have two similar problems here
10:23 - both requiring us to paint
10:25 - new tiles but in a way that does not end
10:27 - with us fighting the arrangement of
10:28 - existing tiles
10:30 - i have to say this problem was a real
10:33 - doozy
10:34 - i spent a long time racking my brains as
10:36 - how i could do this
10:37 - but keep it simple enough to convey in a
10:39 - tutorial
10:40 - and finally i struck upon this idea how
10:43 - about we have a special mode
10:46 - that when we paint the tile arranging
10:48 - behaves as if we are painting on a new
10:50 - blank
10:51 - level the new tiles would then only
10:53 - arrange to fit the pattern of the new
10:55 - shape
10:56 - and the level behind would not be
10:57 - affected the final result would be a
11:00 - fast way of layering new level elements
11:02 - over existing ones
11:03 - in a very localized way to pull this off
11:06 - all we need is to keep track of which
11:09 - tiles we have painted
11:10 - since the mouse was clicked and then
11:12 - ensure
11:13 - the costume fixer ignores tiles we have
11:16 - not specifically painted on
11:18 - this time that seems simple enough
11:21 - so let's give it a go make sure we are
11:24 - in the editor sprite
11:25 - and we'll create a new list to keep
11:27 - track of which new tiles have been
11:29 - painted
11:31 - i'll name it edited indexes
11:34 - making it for this sprite only we want
11:37 - this list to be
11:37 - emptied whenever we finish painting new
11:40 - tiles
11:41 - so locate the when i receive move player
11:44 - and here is where we check for the mouse
11:47 - not
11:47 - being pressed in this case we can delete
11:50 - all the edited indexes
11:52 - now find the define paint tile script
11:55 - scroll
11:56 - down a bit to where we check auto being
11:58 - greater than zero
11:59 - this is where we are painting and then
12:01 - about to auto arrange the costume
12:04 - and its neighbors we should make a
12:06 - record
12:07 - of the painted tile indexes at this
12:09 - point
12:10 - but it would be wasteful to allow us to
12:12 - add the same tile indexes to the list
12:14 - more than once
12:15 - so check if the tile index is already in
12:18 - the list
12:18 - using a not edited index contains tile
12:21 - index
12:22 - and only then add tile index to the
12:25 - edited index
12:26 - list without this the list would become
12:29 - huge
12:29 - stuff full of duplicate tile indexes
12:33 - okay excellent look at these
12:36 - usages of fix costume at below
12:39 - we are now keeping track of the painted
12:41 - tiles but we need to limit the fixing up
12:43 - of costumes
12:44 - to be only those tiles in the new list
12:48 - i don't want to do this four times once
12:50 - for each of the fixed costumes
12:52 - so instead let's put the check in the
12:54 - custom block
12:55 - itself navigate to the define fix
12:59 - costume at script
13:00 - and we'll add an if right at the top now
13:04 - here's something new
13:05 - i didn't mention how we were going to
13:07 - turn this local editing feature on and
13:09 - off
13:10 - i'm going to use the space key in my
13:12 - project
13:13 - but you may want to use a different key
13:15 - or add a mode toggle
13:17 - but i like the simplicity of holding
13:19 - down the space key
13:20 - so if key space pressed
13:23 - now when the space key is held down we
13:26 - can prevent the fixing up of costumes
13:28 - that are not
13:29 - already in our list if not edited
13:32 - indexes
13:33 - contains tile index then stop this
13:36 - script
13:37 - oh man hold on hold on this is wrong see
13:40 - i used the tile index variable here this
13:43 - should
13:43 - not have been that it should have been
13:45 - the input variable named idx
13:48 - that is the tile index we are fixing up
13:51 - tile index variable is the tile we are
13:53 - painting
13:54 - wow that would have really messed things
13:56 - up we can test what we have done so far
13:59 - the best way is to use the blue
14:00 - platforms i'll draw one
14:02 - large rectangle like normal but then
14:05 - i'll hold down the space key
14:07 - and draw another one by its side
14:10 - so what have we got here you can see
14:13 - that the first rectangle has not been
14:15 - affected
14:16 - by the newly drawn tiles that's a plus
14:19 - but on the downside this new rectangle
14:21 - is acting as if
14:22 - it was still connected to the old
14:24 - rectangle
14:25 - that is not what we want and it's like
14:28 - that because we have yet to tell the
14:29 - recipe
14:30 - builder to exclude tiles not in our new
14:32 - list of painted indexes
14:35 - find the define build recipe script
14:38 - edge index is the tile we are checking
14:40 - out at this time
14:43 - so again only if key space is pressed
14:49 - and if
14:53 - not edited indexes contains
15:00 - the edge index then
15:03 - we are considering a tile that we have
15:05 - not yet painted within
15:07 - so we want to treat it as a blank tile
15:10 - to do this
15:11 - set recipe to the join of recipe and the
15:14 - number zero
15:15 - there and finally stop this script
15:19 - right are you feeling good about this i
15:22 - am
15:22 - let's give it a test i'll draw a blue
15:25 - platform area as before
15:27 - and then holding down my space key i'll
15:30 - make a new rectangle in front of the
15:32 - first
15:33 - and yes look at that it works
15:35 - beautifully
15:36 - what a triumph it's very pleasing to be
15:38 - able to paint these new blocks
15:40 - in front of the old ones and this should
15:42 - work for pipes too
15:45 - and yes it does look at how i can now
15:47 - draw each pipe
15:49 - as an individual local paint session by
15:51 - holding down the space
15:52 - key that way they don't consider each
15:54 - other when laying themselves out
15:56 - and we are free to draw them anywhere we
15:58 - please yep
15:59 - even over the blue tiles too i think
16:02 - this is a really excellent solution to a
16:04 - complex issue
16:06 - now can i show you another editor
16:08 - feature we should improve
16:11 - i have the auto arranging turned on and
16:13 - i select the blue tile costume using the
16:15 - three key
16:16 - and draw with that now i want to draw an
16:19 - orange platform tile
16:20 - i have to click through all the blue
16:22 - platforms using the three key until i
16:24 - stumble across the orange tile
16:26 - well that's a bit wasteful isn't it in
16:28 - auto mode
16:29 - i only want to choose either a blue or
16:32 - an orange tile type
16:33 - i no longer need to click through all
16:34 - these different costumes just one of
16:36 - each group
16:38 - that would save us a lot of fiddling
16:39 - time finding the right costume
16:42 - so find the define next brush custom
16:45 - block
16:46 - this is triggering when i press a number
16:48 - key and at present it repeatedly moves
16:50 - on to the next costume
16:52 - stopping when the key mapping of the
16:54 - costume matches the key that was pressed
16:57 - so i'm now thinking we skip over all
17:00 - but the first costume from any tile
17:02 - group
17:03 - that is we'd allow the selection of the
17:05 - first blue platform tile
17:07 - but none of the others matter so they
17:09 - are all skipped
17:10 - to do that we need the tile group for
17:13 - the brush
17:13 - costume we'll first set tile group to
17:16 - item
17:17 - chosen brush of tile group
17:26 - first let's consider when we don't want
17:28 - to skip costumes
17:30 - when auto mode is disabled that is auto
17:33 - is less than one
17:34 - then we need to allow selection of every
17:36 - tile
17:41 - and then also when the costume is not
17:44 - part
17:44 - of any tile group that is when tile
17:47 - group
17:48 - equals the empty value in both these
17:50 - cases we can stop this script right away
17:53 - just as we used to do right
17:56 - if we got past that then the brush is
17:58 - part of a tile group we only want to
18:00 - stop
18:01 - if it is the first one of that group in
18:03 - the list
18:05 - so how do we find the first matching
18:07 - value in a list
18:09 - if item hash of tile group in tile
18:12 - groups
18:13 - that gives us the row number of the
18:14 - first item in the list matching the tile
18:16 - group
18:17 - variable so if we compare that with the
18:20 - current costume
18:21 - then this will only be true if the
18:23 - current costume is the first tile from
18:26 - that tile group
18:27 - i think that's quite clever so if it is
18:29 - the first costume of the tile group
18:31 - we can again stop this script otherwise
18:34 - we'll skip it
18:35 - and let the repeat loop look at the next
18:37 - costume in the list instead
18:39 - i think we dare test that now and
18:41 - entering the level editor
18:43 - and pressing 3 selects the blue tile and
18:45 - then again
18:46 - now goes straight on to the next tile
18:48 - type and then toggles back and forward
18:50 - without any of those in between tile
18:52 - costumes
18:53 - super that's just what i was aiming for
18:56 - see how quickly i can switch now as i
18:58 - paint the level
18:59 - the same applies to pipes and wooden
19:01 - blocks yay
19:03 - so there's one more editor tweak we
19:06 - should add before we are free to move on
19:08 - to other topics
19:09 - and that is to fix the eyedropper tool
19:11 - that's the e
19:12 - key where it lets us pick a brush from
19:14 - any tile on the screen
19:16 - and we use it right away and well there
19:19 - lies the problem
19:20 - you can't select any tile it doesn't
19:22 - work on the enemies
19:24 - well that's an easy fix luckily locate
19:27 - the
19:27 - when e key press block in the editor
19:29 - sprite
19:30 - do you remember how we store the enemies
19:32 - in lists object idx
19:34 - is a list of tile indexes and object
19:37 - type
19:38 - is a list of enemy types at those
19:40 - indexes
19:41 - so let's first look at the indexes we'll
19:44 - need a new variable
19:45 - we'll name it obj object hash
19:48 - for this sprite only now set object hash
19:51 - to
19:57 - item hash of tile index in
20:00 - object index object idx
20:08 - this will let us know if there are any
20:09 - enemies located at the tile index under
20:12 - the mouse cursor
20:14 - use an if else and we'll set the chosen
20:16 - brush in both cases
20:18 - check first where the object hash is
20:20 - greater than zero
20:24 - if it is then there was an enemy so we
20:27 - can look up which enemy type that was
20:29 - set the chosen brush to item object hash
20:32 - of object type
20:37 - good that should give us back the type
20:39 - of the enemy at the given tile location
20:42 - run the project now pressing e over a
20:44 - normal tile still sets my brushes before
20:47 - but here goes if i mouse over a gumba
20:49 - and press e
20:50 - here i can now pick up the gumba brush
20:53 - so much easier
20:54 - i love that and the same with this
20:56 - mushroom excellent
20:58 - and the great thing about this is that
20:59 - now it allows me to select and then
21:01 - click to remove
21:02 - an enemy much faster press an e and then
21:05 - click
21:06 - the level editor is becoming so cool
21:08 - don't you think
21:10 - but now time for something completely
21:13 - different
21:14 - have you seen how the level end screens
21:16 - look in super mario bros 3 advanced
21:19 - unlike traditional super mario we don't
21:21 - have the usual flag at the right hand
21:23 - side of the level
21:24 - instead we get an interesting dark area
21:27 - like we've run out of level and then in
21:29 - the middle is a box that contains a
21:30 - power up of some sort that is cycling
21:32 - away in the background
21:34 - i assume this is collected as an end of
21:36 - level perk
21:37 - before the level concludes and we are
21:38 - able to move on to the next level
21:41 - so how much of this can we cram into the
21:43 - last part of this video
21:45 - let's start with the end box sprite
21:48 - click into the enemy sprite and you
21:49 - should find that the n-boxes costumes
21:52 - are here where we put them earlier the
21:54 - first empty costume is named end
21:56 - box just as one word with a capital e
21:59 - and a capital b
22:00 - and there are three more costumes
22:02 - following that showing the different
22:03 - perks available
22:05 - we need to initially tell the enemy
22:06 - sprite how to clone this type of enemy
22:09 - find the define spawn type custom block
22:12 - and we'll duplicate the last if to
22:13 - define
22:14 - a new type of enemy
22:17 - we don't want this set frame to -1 so
22:20 - delete that
22:21 - to find the tile type we want to check
22:23 - the costume number of the tile sprite
22:26 - if we look up the end box in the tile
22:28 - sprite we find its costume number is 47.
22:32 - so back in the enemy sprite check if
22:34 - tile type
22:35 - equals 47 then in the set type custom
22:38 - block
22:39 - set the type to end box capital e
22:42 - capital b without a space the costume is
22:45 - the same
22:46 - end box and leave the width and height
22:48 - as 16.
22:50 - okay we are good to run the project and
22:52 - we can rush over to the right hand side
22:54 - of the entire
22:55 - level
22:59 - now we have some work to do press the 2
23:02 - key until you find the dark square
23:04 - and now we need to paint a large area
23:07 - i'm standing
23:08 - so that the right hand wall is just off
23:10 - screen
23:11 - and now begin to fill in the entire
23:13 - background black
23:16 - this is actually quite therapeutic
23:20 - and then scrolling to the left a little
23:22 - i press two again until i find the black
23:24 - edge costume
23:26 - this i paint up the edge like so now if
23:29 - you want to challenge
23:30 - you could update the tile groups and
23:32 - recipes to make this
23:33 - auto arrange too because of this
23:36 - platform to the left
23:37 - i'm going to raise the height of the
23:39 - dark area just a little bit more
23:41 - there right and now we can place the end
23:44 - box
23:45 - press nine until it comes up and i think
23:48 - it wants placing around the middle point
23:51 - about there great the reason i made this
23:55 - an
23:55 - enemy in the first place was because the
23:57 - sprite is larger than a single tile
24:00 - so it otherwise would have to be made up
24:02 - of nine smaller costumes
24:03 - i didn't really fancy that so i did it
24:05 - this way
24:06 - there's no particular right or wrong in
24:08 - these things and you just have to weigh
24:10 - up the plus and minuses and then just go
24:12 - for it
24:13 - so exiting the level editor i can now
24:16 - check this out
24:17 - and it's looking pretty sweet all we
24:19 - need to make it look authentic
24:21 - is to add the animating perk in this box
24:24 - for that find the when i receive move
24:26 - enemy script and scroll
24:27 - right down to the bottom here is where
24:30 - we process
24:31 - each enemy type so again duplicate this
24:34 - last one
24:34 - and we'll check for a type of end box
24:38 - chuck away the tick life block and we'll
24:40 - handle this ourselves
24:42 - to animate the costume we'll use the
24:44 - frame variable
24:46 - change frame by 0.15
24:50 - the larger this value the faster the
24:52 - perk will change
24:53 - next set costume to now i'll just check
24:56 - the costume number of the first
24:57 - nbox perk
25:03 - it's 23 okay so set the costume variable
25:06 - to 23
25:07 - plus and then use a mod of three
25:11 - to cycle between the three costumes
25:14 - lastly on the left of the mod
25:16 - place a floor of frame remember that
25:19 - floor rounds the number down to the
25:20 - nearest whole number
25:22 - finally place the stop this script at
25:24 - the end of the if
25:25 - and we are ready to test
25:30 - oh yeah that's looking very authentic
25:33 - indeed
25:33 - i just need a way to be able to collect
25:35 - it to trigger the end of level
25:37 - now you'll note i can't walk off the
25:38 - right of the level because there's a
25:40 - wall there
25:41 - that we will have to work around but
25:43 - first things first
25:44 - we can make a simple collection script
25:46 - right here after setting the costume
25:49 - if touching mario then
25:56 - but i'm going to add another test to
25:57 - make things a little better checking if
25:59 - the distance to mario is less than 28
26:02 - this is to ensure it doesn't trigger
26:04 - from too far away
26:06 - i want mario to overlap the tile a
26:08 - little bit since it otherwise includes
26:10 - the n-box border in the collision
26:13 - and then very similar to how we
26:14 - triggered the mario death we can
26:16 - broadcast a new message
26:18 - mario level complete this frees us up to
26:21 - script the end of the level any way we
26:23 - please
26:24 - however we probably want to make the end
26:25 - perk appear collected
26:27 - so let's replace the last costume with
26:29 - the empty end box now
26:32 - to do that we can set type to pretty
26:34 - much any unused value
26:35 - i'll pick the word costume to represent
26:37 - a single unchanging costume
26:39 - and then set the costume to end box
26:42 - capital e
26:43 - capital b without space there we can
26:46 - give that another quick test
26:47 - just hold on a second right so if i now
26:51 - jump
26:51 - into the end box oh nice we can collect
26:54 - the perk
26:55 - or at least it appears so at this point
26:57 - one day we'll have to do something with
26:59 - it won't we
27:00 - but this is not that day so
27:03 - now we have the end box triggering the
27:06 - level complete event
27:07 - i think we should put something together
27:09 - quickly to get mario to register this
27:11 - event
27:12 - click into the mario sprite and we can
27:14 - find existing when i receive mario
27:16 - lose life we want to do something quite
27:19 - similar here
27:20 - only the animation will be different and
27:22 - instead of the level of his setting
27:24 - we will reset to the next level instead
27:27 - therefore duplicate the when i receive
27:29 - mario lose life and we can drag it into
27:31 - some free space
27:33 - right what can we remove from this
27:35 - script first off we don't want to play
27:37 - this lose live
27:38 - sound or set the player action to lose
27:40 - life
27:41 - we can take this a block of script at a
27:43 - time so i'll move everything
27:45 - under the first repeat over to the right
27:48 - what we're leaving in
27:49 - is the stop other scripts in sprite that
27:52 - is what causes the other main game loop
27:54 - to end
27:55 - and this one to take over in its place
27:58 - so i watched more videos of how mario
28:00 - reacts to the end of level perk
28:01 - collisions
28:02 - i note he tends to stop dead in his
28:04 - tracks so we can do the same by setting
28:06 - speed x to zero
28:08 - now instead of repeating a fixed number
28:10 - of times
28:11 - bring in a repeat and till block mario
28:14 - will be in the middle of a jump
28:16 - so let's repeat until he's back on the
28:18 - ground
28:19 - how can we tell that well falling will
28:21 - be less than one
28:22 - this number is always increasing until
28:24 - we land on the ground
28:26 - now to decide what needs to go within
28:28 - this loop
28:29 - we are completely taking control of the
28:31 - main game loop
28:32 - so to enable mario to still finish his
28:34 - jump and fall to the ground
28:36 - we can first use the handle keys jump
28:38 - block
28:39 - and then the move sprite x and move
28:42 - sprite y blocks
28:43 - and lastly bring back the paint sprite
28:46 - and broadcast position tiles blocks
28:49 - the old repeat loop can be deleted this
28:52 - should now bring mario down to the
28:53 - ground
28:54 - but it should be completely
28:55 - uncontrollable by the player
28:58 - we can give this a quick test i'm just
29:00 - zooming over to the end of the level
29:01 - oh wow wait i almost messed up again
29:04 - look
29:05 - we left the when i receive event as
29:07 - mario lou's life
29:08 - so sorry change that to be when i
29:10 - receive mario
29:11 - level complete of course right
29:14 - i can now safely jump into the nbox and
29:17 - pow i
29:17 - fall to the ground i can confirm i have
29:20 - completely lost control of mario now
29:22 - that's perfect as we now just want him
29:24 - to run off screen to the right to
29:26 - conclude the level
29:28 - we'll begin that process by ensuring
29:30 - that we are facing right
29:31 - point in direction 90. now we'll repeat
29:34 - until
29:38 - their x position is greater than 250.
29:41 - that is he's off the right-hand edge of
29:43 - the screen oh now hold on
29:45 - isn't there a wall in the way of mario
29:47 - to his right yes there is but don't
29:49 - worry
29:50 - this ending animation is no longer going
29:52 - to obey any laws of the level
29:54 - we just change x by 5 to move them right
29:57 - change player frame by 0.6 to give them
30:00 - an animation
30:02 - and lastly add the paint sprite and
30:04 - broadcast position tiles to ensure
30:06 - everything is drawn correctly so with
30:09 - mario off-screen we are all but
30:11 - done if we had an in-between level fade
30:14 - or splash screen then we could trigger
30:16 - that now but
30:17 - as we don't how about we simply trigger
30:19 - the next level to load
30:21 - this should be super easy for us we
30:23 - already have the level reload when we
30:24 - died
30:25 - and the scripts are just here to the
30:26 - right i'll also keep the repeat 30 loop
30:29 - to pause a second before
30:30 - loading we can delete the rest of these
30:33 - old duplicated scripts now
30:35 - so to make the next level load instead
30:37 - of the same one
30:38 - we simply change level by one and drop
30:40 - it in just before the broadcast to level
30:42 - load
30:43 - like so simple before we test this
30:46 - though
30:47 - a quick shout out to channel member
30:48 - james who spotted a soundbug during
30:50 - early access
30:51 - that will teach me from using my audio
30:53 - while recording click into the sound
30:55 - sprite and we'll add a stop
30:57 - other scripts in sprite to the top of
30:59 - the define music script
31:01 - without this we get the awful crackly
31:02 - music in level 2.
31:04 - if you're interested why well it's
31:06 - because both of these two broadcast
31:07 - receivers end up running the same
31:09 - foreverloop script
31:10 - at the same time continually
31:12 - interrupting one another and only
31:13 - getting to play the tiniest part of the
31:15 - sound
31:15 - before the other interrupts and does the
31:17 - same thing continually
31:19 - forever yuck and this is it folks
31:23 - the final test for today let me get over
31:25 - to the level end and
31:27 - gosh will it work i'll jump at the end
31:30 - box
31:31 - now you can see mario correctly turned
31:32 - around and is walking off screen
31:34 - there's a pause and celebration this is
31:37 - indeed
31:38 - level two such that it is can you
31:40 - believe we finally got here
31:42 - now there's plenty of room for
31:44 - improvements but i really wanted to at
31:46 - least get things working
31:47 - and we certainly have that for those who
31:50 - would have liked to have seen
31:51 - a classic mario flag ending well that
31:53 - would be no problem here either
31:55 - you would just need to swap the end box
31:57 - for an end flagpole
31:59 - then fix up the end animation where
32:01 - mario drops down to be in time with your
32:03 - falling flag
32:04 - i think that would be quite possible
32:06 - when within your reach
32:08 - in reality it's not so different really
32:10 - what i
32:11 - am excited about is that we have reached
32:13 - a point where i don't have any obvious
32:15 - loose ends
32:16 - and that frees us up to look at more
32:18 - interesting topics
32:19 - next time gosh do we have a whole load
32:22 - of requests
32:22 - there i will shortly put up a new poll
32:25 - just to see what you guys would like to
32:26 - prioritize some possibilities include
32:29 - the original small mario power ups
32:32 - crouching
32:32 - new enemies sloping tiles checkpoints
32:34 - title screens and menus oh
32:36 - man so much to think about but that
32:39 - brings us to the end of another episode

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch and in this part 13 of our tiled scrolling platformer series we are going to complete the work we started on our level editor and also bring in some new fun tiles to enhance our levels then to complete the episode we're going to squeeze in some basic level progression scripts yes we will be able to get to level two now if you've been following along from week to week and don't already have the orange platforming tiles in your project then you'll find them along with other new costumes in the updated asset project on my griffbatch tutor account as always there's a link under the video so let's open that up now and we'll simply backpack the entire tile sprite and the enemy sprite now my backpack is nice and empty you can keep it like this by rightclicking on items you don't want anymore and deleting them from your backpack good to know okay we can now open up our personal tile scrolling projects this would be a good time to make a backup using the file save as copy it's good practice to keep doing this especially between episodes right open your backpack and drag out the enemy and the tiles sprite this will result in us having an enemy 2 and a tiles 2 sprite let's start with the tiles 2 sprite if we check out the new costumes oh yeah here we go the first new costume is the bush at costume 31. if i switch to the original tile sprite i'll just confirm that the last costume we had before was the mushroom at costume 30. yeah there it is i hope that's the same for you so we can start copying these new costumes from tiles 2 into the original tile sprite one at a time counting as we go yep all the way to costumes 48 and 49. next we'll check out the costumes of our original enemy sprite okay the last one is another mushroom yeah it's costume number 21. click into the enemy 2 sprite and yes costume 21 is also a mushroom so let's begin copying costumes 22 and up into the original enemy sprite 22 23 24 and costume 25 and that's it i'm looking forward to making use of these costumes aren't you these are for the end of level progression later on in the video so stick around for that just checking that those costumes are all there in the enemy sprite great so we can safely delete the tiles 2 and enemy 2 sprites make sure you delete the right ones we don't want a disaster at this point do we our next job is to configure all the list data required by these sprites click into the editor sprite and make the tile key map list visible also the tile shape list and the tile groups list do you remember what each of these is for don't worry i'll go over these again quickly as we update each one start by clicking into the tiles sprite and enter the costume editor so our first list is the keymap list and this lets us assign a number key to a costume for use in the level editor then when we press that number key we can paint with that costume numbers 1 to four have been used for the normal blocks and key nine is for enemies we'll start at row 31 then that's the new bush costume assign that to key number two and the same for the cloud platform key2 next up we have the orange platforms all the way up to costume41 these can be set to key 3 just like our blue costumes were so yes enter a 3 for each row from 33 to 41 then we have four pipe costumes i'll enter these as keys one for rows 42 43 44 and 45. right now this star will be an enemy just like the new mushroom was so give it a key of nine and the same for the end box costume it should be treated as an enemy key nine the last two costumes are background tiles and key two will be fine for these i think the next list is the tile shapes list that is used to let our project know which tiles are solid which are platforms and which are not solid at all that is we can walk through them we start at row 32 this is the cloud platform it acts the same as the top of a drop through platform so we enter an equal symbol for that oh look the next three tiles are also the tops of platforms so rows 33 34 and 35 are also equals the rest of the platforms don't count as solid so we can skip through these but the pipe that will be fully solid for the time being so make rows until row 42 in the list and then enter a hash and the same for rows 43 44 and 45 2. that's four hashes and that's it for the solid list so on to the tile group list this was new in the last episode and it was used for the tile auto arranging scripts we use it to group tile costumes that should auto arrange that will apply to the new orange platforms and the pipes i'll just check what group numbers we've already used okay so one and two only so let's use three for the yellow platforms start at row 33 and enter the group numbers of 3 for all the rows up to row 41 like this the pipes are next these can be group 4. we'll set rows 42 43 44 and 45 to 4. now we could create a group for these black end tiles here but i don't want to bore you to death so i'm leaving them a b because next up we have to enter the costume recipes oh my i need to make the recipe list visible by going into the editor sprite again and we want the tile recipes list i'll make it nice and big and then go back to the tiles costume editor to see the costumes we are configuring we're starting with costume 33 again now if you need to remember how these codes work then please go back and watch part 12 again because we went into a lot of detail there on how to set these up i did it all again and i'm just going to give you the numbers are you ready the orange platforms starting at costume 33 row 33 just enter zero one one zero space zero one zero zero row thirty four enter zero one one one space zero zero one zero space zero zero zero zero space zero one zero one now row thirty five we have zero zero one one zero zero zero one row thirty six enter one one one zero row thirty seven enter one one one one row 38 enter one zero one one and finally row thirty nine enter one one zero zero i'll just scroll down a bit okay row 40 enter one one zero one and space and a one zero zero zero and row forty one enter one zero zero one now the pipes starting at costume 42 row 42 enter 0 1 1 0 space 0 1 0 0 row 43 we enter 0 0 1 1 space 0 0 zero one row forty four enter one one one zero space one one zero zero and lastly row forty five we enter one zero one one space one zero zero one for you if you find things are not connecting up after this just rewind the video and check these numbers again okay now i can hide these lists from the editor sprite and we'll give the project a run oh no music i've muted my audio i hope you don't mind now enter the level editor with the zero key press the number one key until you find the new green pipe let's place down these tiles they certainly look great when you make a perfect twotile wide column love how the floor also selfarranges around them that's beautiful but i want to also show you a limitation we have not accounted for in our tile layouts placing a second pipe next to an existing one throws our layout engine into chaos it doesn't know what to do as soon as we split them apart from each other they perfectly reassemble so what's going on here well our tile arranger only works with solid blocks of tiles the pipes flush up against each other are therefore treated as a single mass of pipe not two single pipes and so the tile arranger doesn't know how to draw that let's start afresh press the three key and look at the blue and orange platforms now i'm loving how the platforms reassemble as we paint them over each other it's really neat but again there is an issue here if you saw how we use these platforms we actually want the orange platform to appear to be in front of the blue platform with the blue platform looking to stay behind not be rearranged to sit together like this so we have two similar problems here both requiring us to paint new tiles but in a way that does not end with us fighting the arrangement of existing tiles i have to say this problem was a real doozy i spent a long time racking my brains as how i could do this but keep it simple enough to convey in a tutorial and finally i struck upon this idea how about we have a special mode that when we paint the tile arranging behaves as if we are painting on a new blank level the new tiles would then only arrange to fit the pattern of the new shape and the level behind would not be affected the final result would be a fast way of layering new level elements over existing ones in a very localized way to pull this off all we need is to keep track of which tiles we have painted since the mouse was clicked and then ensure the costume fixer ignores tiles we have not specifically painted on this time that seems simple enough so let's give it a go make sure we are in the editor sprite and we'll create a new list to keep track of which new tiles have been painted i'll name it edited indexes making it for this sprite only we want this list to be emptied whenever we finish painting new tiles so locate the when i receive move player and here is where we check for the mouse not being pressed in this case we can delete all the edited indexes now find the define paint tile script scroll down a bit to where we check auto being greater than zero this is where we are painting and then about to auto arrange the costume and its neighbors we should make a record of the painted tile indexes at this point but it would be wasteful to allow us to add the same tile indexes to the list more than once so check if the tile index is already in the list using a not edited index contains tile index and only then add tile index to the edited index list without this the list would become huge stuff full of duplicate tile indexes okay excellent look at these usages of fix costume at below we are now keeping track of the painted tiles but we need to limit the fixing up of costumes to be only those tiles in the new list i don't want to do this four times once for each of the fixed costumes so instead let's put the check in the custom block itself navigate to the define fix costume at script and we'll add an if right at the top now here's something new i didn't mention how we were going to turn this local editing feature on and off i'm going to use the space key in my project but you may want to use a different key or add a mode toggle but i like the simplicity of holding down the space key so if key space pressed now when the space key is held down we can prevent the fixing up of costumes that are not already in our list if not edited indexes contains tile index then stop this script oh man hold on hold on this is wrong see i used the tile index variable here this should not have been that it should have been the input variable named idx that is the tile index we are fixing up tile index variable is the tile we are painting wow that would have really messed things up we can test what we have done so far the best way is to use the blue platforms i'll draw one large rectangle like normal but then i'll hold down the space key and draw another one by its side so what have we got here you can see that the first rectangle has not been affected by the newly drawn tiles that's a plus but on the downside this new rectangle is acting as if it was still connected to the old rectangle that is not what we want and it's like that because we have yet to tell the recipe builder to exclude tiles not in our new list of painted indexes find the define build recipe script edge index is the tile we are checking out at this time so again only if key space is pressed and if not edited indexes contains the edge index then we are considering a tile that we have not yet painted within so we want to treat it as a blank tile to do this set recipe to the join of recipe and the number zero there and finally stop this script right are you feeling good about this i am let's give it a test i'll draw a blue platform area as before and then holding down my space key i'll make a new rectangle in front of the first and yes look at that it works beautifully what a triumph it's very pleasing to be able to paint these new blocks in front of the old ones and this should work for pipes too and yes it does look at how i can now draw each pipe as an individual local paint session by holding down the space key that way they don't consider each other when laying themselves out and we are free to draw them anywhere we please yep even over the blue tiles too i think this is a really excellent solution to a complex issue now can i show you another editor feature we should improve i have the auto arranging turned on and i select the blue tile costume using the three key and draw with that now i want to draw an orange platform tile i have to click through all the blue platforms using the three key until i stumble across the orange tile well that's a bit wasteful isn't it in auto mode i only want to choose either a blue or an orange tile type i no longer need to click through all these different costumes just one of each group that would save us a lot of fiddling time finding the right costume so find the define next brush custom block this is triggering when i press a number key and at present it repeatedly moves on to the next costume stopping when the key mapping of the costume matches the key that was pressed so i'm now thinking we skip over all but the first costume from any tile group that is we'd allow the selection of the first blue platform tile but none of the others matter so they are all skipped to do that we need the tile group for the brush costume we'll first set tile group to item chosen brush of tile group first let's consider when we don't want to skip costumes when auto mode is disabled that is auto is less than one then we need to allow selection of every tile and then also when the costume is not part of any tile group that is when tile group equals the empty value in both these cases we can stop this script right away just as we used to do right if we got past that then the brush is part of a tile group we only want to stop if it is the first one of that group in the list so how do we find the first matching value in a list if item hash of tile group in tile groups that gives us the row number of the first item in the list matching the tile group variable so if we compare that with the current costume then this will only be true if the current costume is the first tile from that tile group i think that's quite clever so if it is the first costume of the tile group we can again stop this script otherwise we'll skip it and let the repeat loop look at the next costume in the list instead i think we dare test that now and entering the level editor and pressing 3 selects the blue tile and then again now goes straight on to the next tile type and then toggles back and forward without any of those in between tile costumes super that's just what i was aiming for see how quickly i can switch now as i paint the level the same applies to pipes and wooden blocks yay so there's one more editor tweak we should add before we are free to move on to other topics and that is to fix the eyedropper tool that's the e key where it lets us pick a brush from any tile on the screen and we use it right away and well there lies the problem you can't select any tile it doesn't work on the enemies well that's an easy fix luckily locate the when e key press block in the editor sprite do you remember how we store the enemies in lists object idx is a list of tile indexes and object type is a list of enemy types at those indexes so let's first look at the indexes we'll need a new variable we'll name it obj object hash for this sprite only now set object hash to item hash of tile index in object index object idx this will let us know if there are any enemies located at the tile index under the mouse cursor use an if else and we'll set the chosen brush in both cases check first where the object hash is greater than zero if it is then there was an enemy so we can look up which enemy type that was set the chosen brush to item object hash of object type good that should give us back the type of the enemy at the given tile location run the project now pressing e over a normal tile still sets my brushes before but here goes if i mouse over a gumba and press e here i can now pick up the gumba brush so much easier i love that and the same with this mushroom excellent and the great thing about this is that now it allows me to select and then click to remove an enemy much faster press an e and then click the level editor is becoming so cool don't you think but now time for something completely different have you seen how the level end screens look in super mario bros 3 advanced unlike traditional super mario we don't have the usual flag at the right hand side of the level instead we get an interesting dark area like we've run out of level and then in the middle is a box that contains a power up of some sort that is cycling away in the background i assume this is collected as an end of level perk before the level concludes and we are able to move on to the next level so how much of this can we cram into the last part of this video let's start with the end box sprite click into the enemy sprite and you should find that the nboxes costumes are here where we put them earlier the first empty costume is named end box just as one word with a capital e and a capital b and there are three more costumes following that showing the different perks available we need to initially tell the enemy sprite how to clone this type of enemy find the define spawn type custom block and we'll duplicate the last if to define a new type of enemy we don't want this set frame to 1 so delete that to find the tile type we want to check the costume number of the tile sprite if we look up the end box in the tile sprite we find its costume number is 47. so back in the enemy sprite check if tile type equals 47 then in the set type custom block set the type to end box capital e capital b without a space the costume is the same end box and leave the width and height as 16. okay we are good to run the project and we can rush over to the right hand side of the entire level now we have some work to do press the 2 key until you find the dark square and now we need to paint a large area i'm standing so that the right hand wall is just off screen and now begin to fill in the entire background black this is actually quite therapeutic and then scrolling to the left a little i press two again until i find the black edge costume this i paint up the edge like so now if you want to challenge you could update the tile groups and recipes to make this auto arrange too because of this platform to the left i'm going to raise the height of the dark area just a little bit more there right and now we can place the end box press nine until it comes up and i think it wants placing around the middle point about there great the reason i made this an enemy in the first place was because the sprite is larger than a single tile so it otherwise would have to be made up of nine smaller costumes i didn't really fancy that so i did it this way there's no particular right or wrong in these things and you just have to weigh up the plus and minuses and then just go for it so exiting the level editor i can now check this out and it's looking pretty sweet all we need to make it look authentic is to add the animating perk in this box for that find the when i receive move enemy script and scroll right down to the bottom here is where we process each enemy type so again duplicate this last one and we'll check for a type of end box chuck away the tick life block and we'll handle this ourselves to animate the costume we'll use the frame variable change frame by 0.15 the larger this value the faster the perk will change next set costume to now i'll just check the costume number of the first nbox perk it's 23 okay so set the costume variable to 23 plus and then use a mod of three to cycle between the three costumes lastly on the left of the mod place a floor of frame remember that floor rounds the number down to the nearest whole number finally place the stop this script at the end of the if and we are ready to test oh yeah that's looking very authentic indeed i just need a way to be able to collect it to trigger the end of level now you'll note i can't walk off the right of the level because there's a wall there that we will have to work around but first things first we can make a simple collection script right here after setting the costume if touching mario then but i'm going to add another test to make things a little better checking if the distance to mario is less than 28 this is to ensure it doesn't trigger from too far away i want mario to overlap the tile a little bit since it otherwise includes the nbox border in the collision and then very similar to how we triggered the mario death we can broadcast a new message mario level complete this frees us up to script the end of the level any way we please however we probably want to make the end perk appear collected so let's replace the last costume with the empty end box now to do that we can set type to pretty much any unused value i'll pick the word costume to represent a single unchanging costume and then set the costume to end box capital e capital b without space there we can give that another quick test just hold on a second right so if i now jump into the end box oh nice we can collect the perk or at least it appears so at this point one day we'll have to do something with it won't we but this is not that day so now we have the end box triggering the level complete event i think we should put something together quickly to get mario to register this event click into the mario sprite and we can find existing when i receive mario lose life we want to do something quite similar here only the animation will be different and instead of the level of his setting we will reset to the next level instead therefore duplicate the when i receive mario lose life and we can drag it into some free space right what can we remove from this script first off we don't want to play this lose live sound or set the player action to lose life we can take this a block of script at a time so i'll move everything under the first repeat over to the right what we're leaving in is the stop other scripts in sprite that is what causes the other main game loop to end and this one to take over in its place so i watched more videos of how mario reacts to the end of level perk collisions i note he tends to stop dead in his tracks so we can do the same by setting speed x to zero now instead of repeating a fixed number of times bring in a repeat and till block mario will be in the middle of a jump so let's repeat until he's back on the ground how can we tell that well falling will be less than one this number is always increasing until we land on the ground now to decide what needs to go within this loop we are completely taking control of the main game loop so to enable mario to still finish his jump and fall to the ground we can first use the handle keys jump block and then the move sprite x and move sprite y blocks and lastly bring back the paint sprite and broadcast position tiles blocks the old repeat loop can be deleted this should now bring mario down to the ground but it should be completely uncontrollable by the player we can give this a quick test i'm just zooming over to the end of the level oh wow wait i almost messed up again look we left the when i receive event as mario lou's life so sorry change that to be when i receive mario level complete of course right i can now safely jump into the nbox and pow i fall to the ground i can confirm i have completely lost control of mario now that's perfect as we now just want him to run off screen to the right to conclude the level we'll begin that process by ensuring that we are facing right point in direction 90. now we'll repeat until their x position is greater than 250. that is he's off the righthand edge of the screen oh now hold on isn't there a wall in the way of mario to his right yes there is but don't worry this ending animation is no longer going to obey any laws of the level we just change x by 5 to move them right change player frame by 0.6 to give them an animation and lastly add the paint sprite and broadcast position tiles to ensure everything is drawn correctly so with mario offscreen we are all but done if we had an inbetween level fade or splash screen then we could trigger that now but as we don't how about we simply trigger the next level to load this should be super easy for us we already have the level reload when we died and the scripts are just here to the right i'll also keep the repeat 30 loop to pause a second before loading we can delete the rest of these old duplicated scripts now so to make the next level load instead of the same one we simply change level by one and drop it in just before the broadcast to level load like so simple before we test this though a quick shout out to channel member james who spotted a soundbug during early access that will teach me from using my audio while recording click into the sound sprite and we'll add a stop other scripts in sprite to the top of the define music script without this we get the awful crackly music in level 2. if you're interested why well it's because both of these two broadcast receivers end up running the same foreverloop script at the same time continually interrupting one another and only getting to play the tiniest part of the sound before the other interrupts and does the same thing continually forever yuck and this is it folks the final test for today let me get over to the level end and gosh will it work i'll jump at the end box now you can see mario correctly turned around and is walking off screen there's a pause and celebration this is indeed level two such that it is can you believe we finally got here now there's plenty of room for improvements but i really wanted to at least get things working and we certainly have that for those who would have liked to have seen a classic mario flag ending well that would be no problem here either you would just need to swap the end box for an end flagpole then fix up the end animation where mario drops down to be in time with your falling flag i think that would be quite possible when within your reach in reality it's not so different really what i am excited about is that we have reached a point where i don't have any obvious loose ends and that frees us up to look at more interesting topics next time gosh do we have a whole load of requests there i will shortly put up a new poll just to see what you guys would like to prioritize some possibilities include the original small mario power ups crouching new enemies sloping tiles checkpoints title screens and menus oh man so much to think about but that brings
