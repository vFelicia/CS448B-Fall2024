00:02 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch
00:05 - do you feel lucky well do ya because
00:08 - today our classic platformer is suddenly
00:10 - looking a lot more dangerous yes we are
00:13 - going to add some very pointy spikes and
00:15 - some very hot lava i don't think
00:18 - scratchy or guy will thank you for this
00:20 - unless they happen to be adrenaline
00:21 - junkies and then perhaps they will
00:24 - so write off what do we do yes be a good
00:27 - coder and save a copy of your project
00:29 - this is episode 7.
00:32 - okay let's get scratching
00:35 - run the project i'm going to just scout
00:37 - my level for a good place to add some
00:39 - danger yes i think scene 2 is a prime
00:43 - target now the way i'm going to do this
00:45 - is to make a duplicate of the level
00:47 - sprite and we'll rename it
00:50 - danger
00:53 - positions a little off as you can see on
00:55 - the project stage but we can just click
00:57 - the green flag and that'll all snap
00:59 - together sweet
01:01 - so open the danger sprite costumes do
01:05 - make absolutely sure you are editing the
01:07 - dangerous sprite costumes and not the
01:09 - level sprites costumes you don't want to
01:12 - lose your carefully drawn levels have
01:14 - you checked really
01:16 - okay then
01:17 - within the scene 2 costume of the danger
01:20 - sprite i am now drawing a very very i
01:22 - mean seriously killer red square that
01:25 - will with a little cunning manipulation
01:27 - soon become a deadly red triangle or
01:30 - even a red spike yes that's what it is
01:33 - maybe even three spikes more pointy
01:35 - perhaps yeah good so this is where
01:38 - things get interesting we now have to
01:40 - remove everything from this costume that
01:42 - is not deadly delete delete delete here
01:45 - we go cleaning up
01:47 - nice
01:48 - now you should see the spikes showing in
01:50 - a stage alongside the level that we of
01:52 - course didn't delete by mistake after
01:54 - all my warnings
01:55 - good job
01:57 - so then we now also have to delete all
02:00 - the other costumes from the danger
02:02 - sprite just leaving this one
02:08 - let's run the project
02:10 - hold the phone why are those spikes
02:12 - showing on scene one do you know
02:14 - well it's because we are always showing
02:17 - the danger sprite and this is the only
02:19 - danger costume available so it will
02:21 - always show
02:22 - to fix this we don't have to have a
02:25 - danger costume for every scene in our
02:27 - level no make a new blank costume
02:32 - and name it blank
02:35 - then in our scripts find the when i
02:37 - receive change scene receiver
02:40 - when we change scene we try to change
02:42 - the danger costume to the given scene
02:44 - name now we do have a scene 2 danger
02:46 - costume but we don't have a scene 1.
02:49 - when you change to a non-existent
02:51 - costume scratch stays on the last
02:53 - costume it was set to so it doesn't end
02:55 - up changing to address this we add a new
02:58 - switch costume above the first and
03:00 - switch to the blank costume
03:03 - now if the second costume change doesn't
03:05 - work we'll remain on the blank costume
03:08 - that's neat
03:09 - running that now and you can see those
03:12 - horrible scary pointy things have
03:14 - vanished few
03:15 - however i highly suspect if i walk into
03:18 - the next screen
03:20 - oh they're horrible oh no oh wait this
03:23 - is what we wanted so yes i can just test
03:26 - popping back and forward between two
03:28 - scenes to ensure the dangerous sprite
03:29 - only appears at the right time great
03:33 - so i guess now we need to finally face
03:36 - our greatest fear and touch the
03:39 - oh oh i'm alive gosh they look so deadly
03:42 - too it appears we have more work to do
03:45 - click into the player sprite
03:48 - now when we lose a life we are going to
03:50 - want for the time being to make use of
03:52 - this define reset and begin level script
03:55 - before we proceed to do that we can make
03:58 - a simplification we'll use the begin
04:01 - scene custom block we already use this
04:03 - to change scenes when walking off the
04:05 - edge of a scene but we can use it here
04:07 - now as well
04:09 - fill in the scene number with a 1
04:11 - matching the set scene from the top
04:13 - which we can now delete
04:16 - next set the x to negative 150
04:21 - and the y to 55
04:25 - and that's it it replaces these last
04:27 - three blocks completely as it also
04:29 - performs these broadcasts itself
04:32 - smash the green flag just to make sure
04:34 - everything is still tickety-boo
04:36 - yep we are spawning just the same and
04:39 - when we restart from another scene we
04:41 - appear back on scene 1.
04:43 - good
04:45 - you know what's been bugging me
04:47 - drop in a point in direction block here
04:49 - and set it to 90. i prefer is to point
04:52 - the same way each time we start
04:55 - right let's lose a life
04:58 - find the when i receive tick last script
05:01 - the best place to look for collisions
05:03 - with dangerous sprites is here after
05:05 - everything is finished moving and the
05:07 - costumes are all displayed
05:09 - at the bottom
05:10 - if touching danger
05:16 - then
05:18 - we'll now broadcast a new message
05:23 - lose life
05:25 - this is going to be real simple
05:28 - find some space
05:33 - and when i receive lose life
05:37 - start by stopping all the other scripts
05:39 - in this sprite
05:41 - that stops the main game loop right away
05:43 - otherwise things would really mess up
05:45 - now you can play around here with your
05:47 - players lose a life animation or effect
05:50 - i'm just going to fade the player away
05:52 - for starters with a repeat 10 and then
05:54 - change ghost effect by 10.
05:57 - 10 tens is 100 so that does a full fade
06:00 - out
06:01 - then we can wait for half a second 0.5
06:05 - before we then reset the game reset and
06:08 - begin level
06:11 - are you ready for this here we go
06:14 - progress onto scene 2.
06:20 - sit on a spike
06:22 - ouch
06:23 - we fade away as planned
06:26 - oh bother the good news is we are back
06:28 - on scene one the bad news is that we
06:30 - have appeared to be
06:32 - invisible and of course we are we never
06:35 - reset the ghost effect did we
06:37 - scroll back to the when i receive game
06:39 - loop script
06:42 - we'll simply add a set ghost effect to
06:44 - zero right at the top before the main
06:46 - game loop begins
06:52 - cool
06:53 - let's run that again
06:55 - here we go
06:57 - ouch and yes we have reset i can see
07:01 - scratchy super yes in the words of cap i
07:05 - could do this all day
07:08 - but seriously who would want to we need
07:10 - more spikes more danger more more
07:13 - everything of course adding more spikes
07:15 - to scene two is no problem we can just
07:17 - draw them in and position them by
07:19 - looking at the stage for reference
07:21 - and yep they are just as deadly as their
07:23 - siblings so how about adding danger on
07:27 - another scene like scene one well easy
07:30 - just create another costume for scene 1
07:34 - naming it carefully as scene 1 capital s
07:38 - then position it again using the stage
07:40 - as a reference
07:42 - and run the project
07:48 - as you can see the costume changing
07:49 - works great and we can have dangers on
07:52 - any scene we want
07:54 - but griff patch what about the uber cool
07:57 - animating lava effect you had in the
07:59 - video from episode one
08:01 - ah right i guess we should add some of
08:04 - that right
08:05 - we could just draw the lava costume like
08:07 - we did the spikes but let me show you
08:09 - how we can also copy costumes to make
08:11 - lining things up easier in the level
08:14 - sprite just drag scene 3 into the
08:16 - dangerous bright
08:17 - and then back in the danger sprite we
08:19 - are free to go to town drawing our
08:21 - danger lava exactly where we want it
08:25 - there and then of course delete the rest
08:27 - of the level as it isn't meant to be
08:29 - dangerous
08:30 - so that leaves our lava pool
08:33 - but it's supposed to be a little more
08:34 - dynamic than that so that we know it's
08:36 - lava we want it to pulse up and down
08:40 - for this we click back into the danger
08:42 - sprite code tab
08:43 - we only want the lava to pulse up and
08:45 - down not the spikes so use an if block
08:48 - in the change scene script
08:51 - checking for when seen is equal to three
08:56 - that's this scene
08:58 - now here's the beauty of this
08:59 - platforming engine although we are using
09:01 - the tick broadcasts because we are not
09:03 - restricting them using broadcast and
09:05 - weights we can still use a forever loop
09:07 - in here to create an animation without
09:09 - worrying about slowing down the rest of
09:11 - the game
09:12 - to make the lava move up and down set y
09:15 - position two now this is a common math
09:17 - script for circular motion
09:19 - we need a multiply
09:22 - on the right a sine operator s i n
09:28 - then in that another multiply
09:31 - on the left use timer
09:34 - okay there are two remaining three
09:36 - values to fill out the left one is how
09:39 - far you want the lava to wibble up and
09:42 - down we'll say five pixels up and down
09:46 - and the right side is how fast you want
09:48 - it to wibble 360 means it will do a full
09:52 - cycle in one second
09:55 - let's see what that looks like
10:00 - oh yeah that is cool but do feel free to
10:03 - play with these values maybe we'll slow
10:06 - it down a bit
10:07 - try 180 to half the speed
10:10 - and tweak the distance
10:11 - maybe just three
10:13 - there isn't that something now if you
10:16 - want to have spikes and lava on the same
10:19 - screen you may want to duplicate this
10:21 - danger sprite into two sprites so that
10:24 - one can move while the other stays still
10:27 - that's the simplest way perhaps but you
10:29 - could also use clones to accomplish the
10:30 - same effect with a single sprite
10:33 - right that is all the teaching i have
10:35 - for now until the next episode where we
10:37 - will be finally looking at moving
10:39 - platforms however before we finish i
10:42 - really want to share with you more of
10:43 - the amazing projects you scratchers have
10:46 - been submitting to the studios can i
10:48 - start with andre's desk ass 1945's
10:51 - project
10:52 - first impressions are like wow look at
10:55 - the art and the animation is awesome oh
10:58 - man there's a hole watch out for that
11:00 - one it's a bit hard to see with all the
11:02 - shades of um sand yeah that's my excuse
11:06 - anyhow there's a bridge nice and look at
11:08 - the wall sliding costume it's
11:09 - excellently done i wonder what game this
11:12 - character is originally from either way
11:14 - this scratcher has done a great job
11:15 - getting them into this project
11:18 - now these platforms are a little bit
11:19 - more tricky i'm really enjoying though
11:21 - playing through this level
11:23 - oh no oh i fell to my death and i'm
11:26 - right back at the start ah you know what
11:28 - we are going to have to cover
11:30 - checkpoints in our platformer series
11:31 - aren't we
11:33 - yeah
11:34 - checkpoints next project up boom bang
11:38 - one one two four eight one six three two
11:41 - what's this press one or two to see the
11:43 - hitbox oh oh cool look you can switch to
11:46 - see the actual hitbox versus the level
11:48 - that you are seeing nothing hidden on
11:50 - this scene
11:51 - ah now this is more interesting see the
11:54 - top platform is a trick and the real
11:56 - entrance is below i like that really
11:59 - cool
12:01 - try going here it says but oh no
12:04 - that was a trick too
12:06 - okay this next project is by john do i
12:09 - want a whirling effect or no
12:11 - let's go for the whirling effect
12:13 - oh oh my goodness it's like the stat
12:16 - whirling effect from that other game but
12:17 - turned up to the nines it's it's really
12:19 - disorientating and maybe perhaps a
12:21 - little bit much i do get a bit travel
12:23 - sick i think i shall try it without
12:25 - oh i feel like the level is still moving
12:29 - right i'm gonna try again up here
12:31 - this level's working really well we can
12:32 - move from screen to screen and the
12:34 - colors are nice
12:36 - i really want to get up here oh i can't
12:38 - do it right i'm going to come back to
12:40 - that i'm sure there's lava and spikes
12:42 - already that's cool
12:44 - um bit of wall jumping
12:46 - watch out for that spike oh that's a
12:47 - tricky one if i just come down a bit
12:49 - yeah
12:51 - and coming back to the left oh oh is
12:53 - this going to link up with that little
12:54 - bit at the top yay celebration i like
12:57 - that
12:58 - right let's try something else this
12:59 - project is by logic cue dev 2. oh it's
13:03 - me that's a ball oh and the level's
13:05 - moving look at that moving platforms how
13:07 - cool wow i'm really boingy
13:11 - it almost feels like a combination of my
13:13 - ball physics project but it may be not
13:15 - quite so but nearly it doesn't roll down
13:18 - these slopes but uh that's cool why i'm
13:20 - so fast oh that's the end of the level
13:22 - oh well it's cool though it's got a lot
13:24 - of potential i like the way the face
13:25 - rolls that's good and it leaves a big
13:27 - trail of me
13:28 - next we have sky high 173
13:31 - what have you got for us oh this is a
13:34 - pleasant looking level look at the
13:35 - clouds i love that and i've seen this
13:37 - before but maybe in a previous version
13:39 - we got this vertical bit of blah
13:42 - oh well let's try that again
13:46 - okay now i need to watch
13:47 - [Music]
13:49 - oh look different music track
13:52 - oh it's nice because i'm going a
13:53 - different way
13:54 - i feel oh oh that was a bit of a sudden
13:57 - uh drop
13:58 - let's be a bit more careful this time i
14:00 - love the background you've seen the hazy
14:02 - like background oh oh the hazy
14:04 - background in this no no no no no no
14:07 - it's a bit harsh let's try that one more
14:09 - time okay here we go here we go here we
14:11 - go here we go i got this i've got this
14:13 - i've got this yes
14:15 - so we can progress on with this level
14:17 - watch out
14:18 - oh it's so harsh it goes right back to
14:20 - the start
14:21 - see we definitely need checkpoints okay
14:23 - this project's by bambang one one two
14:25 - four eight one six three two don't just
14:27 - love these usernames now this one
14:29 - appears to be
14:31 - almost like a bug report there's a known
14:32 - bug that you can wall jump up a wall if
14:35 - you can just press the keys at just the
14:36 - right time and i am not doing very well
14:38 - at that obviously i will not do a very
14:40 - good job of beating this level come on
14:42 - come on come on i can do it hey no got
14:44 - it got it got it there see did you see
14:46 - that oh my goodness you have to do the
14:47 - whole thing on this wall too um there's
14:50 - no way i've got the skill to pull this
14:52 - one off come on come on come on
14:54 - no no there you go maybe you do better
14:57 - okay thank you hello lolly for
14:59 - submitting your project to the studio oh
15:00 - we got a nice soundtrack kind of very
15:02 - pleasant green and blue sky oh
15:04 - rectangular oh whoa okay so we've got
15:08 - some quite tricky little jumps here on
15:09 - the next screen so be careful
15:12 - okay i think i got this getting more
15:14 - difficult as time goes by so gotta be oh
15:17 - wow look at this it's all about getting
15:19 - these jumps right
15:21 - okay it's definitely a little jumping
15:23 - game this one
15:24 - no vertical scrolling on this game whoa
15:27 - whoa whoa whoa oh yes
15:29 - that was a close one
15:30 - you're never quite sure what's gonna
15:31 - come oh my goodness right big jump now
15:34 - yeah i think as long as i do big jumps
15:35 - off the edges of these really tricky
15:37 - bits i'm gonna be oh i'm stuck but i've
15:40 - won hey well done me thank you for that
15:42 - game
15:43 - now scratcher nagoyan you have submitted
15:46 - a very psychedelic project i'm quite a
15:50 - little cat and i can run like the wind
15:53 - and the music's nice
15:55 - going to the air
15:58 - i guess i oh i'm trapped
16:00 - i'm not sure i can get back oh well on
16:02 - to the next then
16:04 - so sabco so this one looks like it
16:06 - follows my tutorial quite well and a bit
16:08 - more colorful than mine
16:11 - oh i like this little side door
16:13 - oh the level's a bit bigger than mine
16:15 - then oh
16:16 - come on come on come on i can climb up
16:18 - here
16:19 - no i can't i better go down
16:21 - okay h t f l m f
16:25 - how on earth would you pronounce that at
16:27 - film one okay you've given us this
16:29 - rather exciting looking black and white
16:31 - project i like that
16:34 - and it's kind of like a happy cube
16:37 - i can wall jump that's cool but i think
16:39 - i'm going to go to the right here it's
16:41 - like film noir version of guy
16:43 - oh look at his lives move could you see
16:45 - that that's really quite cool yeah we're
16:47 - going this is going pretty well i like
16:49 - this this is a bit of a different oh oh
16:51 - no i'm stuck i might love my eyes though
16:54 - good work okay next up sweep sweep 2.
16:57 - look at these lovely colors
17:00 - oh spikes that was lucky oh yeah that
17:02 - resets me right back to the start let's
17:04 - have a look a look over here no no no
17:06 - oh this is a bit harsh right let's go
17:08 - somewhere a bit safer which way to go
17:11 - oh i guess we'll
17:13 - down we go then
17:15 - i think we're the same
17:17 - same oh oh my goodness
17:19 - quite short oh i just teleported through
17:20 - the water oh my goodness on earth's
17:22 - going on i think the uh the
17:25 - scene changing is a little bit uh
17:27 - obscure oh look the spikes disappeared
17:29 - and i fell through the ceiling that
17:30 - wasn't there oh my goodness oh oh my
17:33 - goodness me this is a quite uh quite
17:35 - something
17:37 - oh my goodness
17:39 - oh if i could fall down here oh look at
17:41 - this like it goes super fast i'm gonna
17:44 - have to end at some point my goodness
17:45 - imagine what level i'm really on oh
17:47 - see there's a lovely thing about this
17:49 - engine is that uh because we're doing
17:51 - that clever step thing we can actually
17:53 - fall really really fast and still
17:55 - collide with surfaces that are really
17:56 - thin so that's a really good thing about
17:58 - this engine right let's go on to the
17:59 - next one
18:01 - so this next one's by maths games we've
18:03 - got this nice blue color i like that i
18:05 - like the fact that the level is all
18:06 - contained and it's quite nice it's got
18:08 - like smooth walls and nice gradients and
18:11 - nothing too sharp
18:13 - oh this bit's a bit more rectangular but
18:15 - i like i like the fact that it's all
18:16 - contained up there
18:18 - okay next up we have a zed
18:21 - or at the z we've got some lovely color
18:23 - changing going off here the level and
18:25 - scratch cat
18:27 - the basic platforming says oh yeah we
18:29 - got up and down scrolling there
18:31 - scene changing sorry
18:33 - uh oh that looks like a big spike on the
18:35 - ceiling watch out if i just jump over
18:37 - here whoa oh my goodness oh look it's
18:40 - like a little party zone to be honest it
18:42 - feels like like uh disco
18:45 - okay rapunzel 6262 what have you got for
18:47 - us
18:51 - wow i feel like i'm jumping to this
18:52 - music
18:54 - oh did you hear that pop
18:57 - oh look at the nice gradients i like
18:59 - that oh am i standing on here like sand
19:01 - or something
19:06 - it's quite fun with the big scratch cat
19:08 - and a nice chunky level
19:09 - [Music]
19:13 - oh i wonder what i'm going to it's just
19:15 - quite a pleasant little stroll through
19:16 - this little jumping thing oh there we go
19:19 - i like it thank you rapunzel
19:21 - oh i cannot pronounce this one
19:23 - q-h-r-a-w-q-e-k-j
19:29 - was that about right but my goodness
19:31 - this is looking like exactly like my
19:34 - initial tutorial level wow i'm impressed
19:36 - that there's a moving platform i seem to
19:38 - be a little bit stuck to it
19:40 - but the lava is working brilliantly
19:42 - so we are going to be covering the
19:43 - moving platforms in the next tutorial
19:46 - and i'll show you how to get them
19:47 - working a little bit better than this
19:48 - but this this is a really good job well
19:50 - done
19:51 - i would say your name but you know i
19:52 - just haven't quite got the uh the
19:53 - language oh lemon i think i've won what
19:56 - an excellent ending thank you for that
19:58 - one
19:59 - next up we have choc unfamilat that's a
20:03 - brilliant username
20:04 - is this like a power-up now i've
20:07 - collected it i think i can actually jump
20:09 - higher than i could before oh that is
20:11 - such a cool idea i love power-ups i
20:13 - wonder if there's any more in this level
20:14 - to be found i'll just have a jump around
20:17 - and see
20:19 - another power up so to the right oh look
20:21 - look how fast i can go oh oh oh oh oh oh
20:24 - oh it's like i'm being blown around by
20:26 - some huge wind or something um oh
20:29 - imagine if this is this combined with my
20:31 - jumping i don't think i can jump as high
20:32 - now but imagine if i could jump as high
20:34 - as i did before and had this for this
20:36 - sideways motion it would be absolutely
20:37 - insane
20:39 - right um let's have another one this one
20:40 - is by triple d rv
20:42 - and it's looking pretty similar design
20:44 - to my original project i like that wow
20:46 - i'm so fast i can jump really high it
20:49 - could the problem with making things
20:51 - jump so fast or so high is that it
20:53 - actually can make it quite hard to
20:54 - control because you get stuck to the
20:55 - walls and uh and things but oh no game
20:59 - over i jumped up through the ceiling and
21:01 - got stuck
21:02 - next up is
21:03 - scratchmaker2321 oh now i'm really
21:05 - digging this uh guy oh they've got nice
21:08 - sounds too look at his animation it's
21:10 - fantastic his little arms oh when he
21:13 - jumps he puts his like finger off in the
21:14 - air like cool oh dead oh harsh i don't
21:18 - like dying but it's good it's good yeah
21:20 - we got all their features i do yeah that
21:22 - little jump noise is brilliant
21:24 - and his animation is brilliant too i
21:25 - love it nothing just climb up here
21:28 - i wonder what his wall sliding looks
21:30 - like
21:31 - cool
21:33 - okay i'm getting this now i think i'm
21:34 - gonna
21:35 - we're here though
21:36 - oh oh down down okay let's try that one
21:38 - again this is really quite fun
21:40 - come on then
21:42 - okay so down here now careful now i need
21:44 - to go just the right amount oh
21:47 - right skip back up the top this time i
21:49 - got to be really really careful so how
21:51 - far was it i think a little no not again
21:54 - come on
21:56 - [Music]
21:57 - there yes now going careful now come on
22:00 - come on little jumps oh little jumps i
22:02 - know where they are and i can get up
22:04 - here and i saw that thing down at the
22:05 - bottom there so i get it i do you know
22:08 - i guess if i just yeah okay we made it
22:11 - now um can i get up this
22:14 - oh no oh have i come down too early
22:16 - oh i think i've come down too early
22:19 - never mind next one
22:22 - domi12345678 has got the night
22:24 - platformer for us this looks really
22:26 - thematic oh look at the rain
22:28 - oh and a lovely music track too
22:32 - oh that's brilliant
22:34 - and the light beam around me as well oh
22:36 - that's really uh that's really cool it
22:38 - gives a real atmosphere to the game oh i
22:40 - feel like i'm falling down though
22:42 - down every time i move left or right to
22:44 - be going down a level i love the uh i
22:46 - love the graphics they uh quite simple
22:50 - oh green did you see the green
22:52 - what was that how can i get back up
22:55 - there again
22:56 - oh here we go i got it um
22:58 - now
22:59 - is it oh even lighter it's like the
23:00 - higher up i go the brighter it gets
23:03 - if i could just get up if i could wall
23:04 - jump off the right here then i might be
23:06 - able to get over there oh
23:08 - can i even get that oh no it's going
23:10 - darker again
23:11 - i want to get back to the grip there i'm
23:13 - it oh no i'm stuck in a wall oh no
23:16 - oh
23:17 - bob maybe i go right instead
23:20 - okay have i been here before
23:21 - [Music]
23:26 - hey i've made it but that oh oh i guess
23:28 - that's it then i guess i've
23:30 - i guess i've seen all the green but it's
23:32 - really nice i love it i think that could
23:34 - be a really good game if we could just
23:35 - expand it out and add a few more things
23:37 - this next one's by eggy revvilis
23:40 - and it's got a really really funky
23:42 - little character i love the way his
23:44 - little feather ripples as he walks along
23:46 - like a little knight i wonder what the
23:48 - wall jump yeah wall jumping works oh
23:50 - look at that little slide you just see
23:51 - his little hand come out oh that's so
23:53 - sweet
23:54 - what's this i'm not sure what that is
23:57 - i don't think it does anything yet i'll
23:58 - just try going off to the left
24:00 - no i'll go to the right now what is this
24:02 - oh no i don't think i can oh i thought
24:05 - it was a little secret way it was just
24:06 - another little platform
24:08 - oh this is intriguing there's all these
24:09 - little ways in this level um
24:11 - can i get across here
24:15 - oh
24:16 - come on jump yay what's over here then
24:20 - oh i'm not gonna make that i think we're
24:22 - back to the start oh i love it though
24:24 - look at that little guy oh i always love
24:26 - his little hand that pops out too it's
24:27 - so sweet i think that's all we've got
24:29 - for this level but that's really cool
24:31 - game i like look at that and dan 47725
24:34 - has brought us the minecraft platformer
24:37 - and look at that i've got a big rainbow
24:38 - trail as well oh it's a bit of a
24:41 - hyped up minecraft theme i think
24:46 - you've gone to town making this it must
24:47 - have been quite hard to place all these
24:48 - little blocks
24:50 - but it's cool
24:51 - i imagine if you could wall jump like
24:53 - this in minecraft
24:54 - i bet there's a mod for it well i think
24:56 - i found a cave i expect to find a
24:58 - creeper any moment but uh luckily not
25:01 - can i get up here
25:02 - i can't see how i could
25:04 - hmm maybe back no no i think i've found
25:07 - the end of minecraft okay thank you
25:10 - 250119 test 2 for this submission
25:13 - the thumbnail looks beautiful
25:16 - yeah look at this
25:18 - the level design oh i died the graphics
25:21 - are really nice and look we've got
25:23 - checkpoints checkpoints you've beat me
25:25 - to it that's really cool but thank
25:28 - goodness we have got them because my
25:30 - goodness
25:31 - what's this mean then
25:32 - oh oh it's like um on um geometry dash
25:36 - oh oh heck what happened there it's like
25:38 - on oh
25:39 - it's hard to see the spikes i keep oh
25:42 - come on
25:43 - um so i gotta jump over this and then i
25:44 - can bounce on that little yellow thing
25:46 - oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
25:48 - my goodness
25:49 - okay come on this time i'm going to jump
25:51 - on it and right now where do i go about
25:53 - down here watch oh it's just so fast and
25:56 - you don't know what's coming
25:58 - okay fast forward through this okay
25:59 - right
26:00 - so now
26:01 - i can bounce on this yellow thing and me
26:03 - no no i really can't how about we just
26:06 - go right here instead
26:08 - ah i'm on the other side everybody's
26:10 - meant to go no i seem to die an awful
26:13 - lot oh yes
26:15 - did i make it when you made a new screen
26:17 - i know i can't get there down here then
26:19 - oh yeah down here
26:22 - checkpoints are excellent
26:24 - whoa complicated this is cool so i guess
26:27 - i go left oh secret room
26:30 - a secret room but i want to go across oh
26:33 - checkpoint yeah good oh
26:36 - oh my goodness it feels like geometry
26:38 - dashing it's the same sound we could do
26:39 - it like a particle explosion couldn't we
26:43 - so thank you everyone for your awesome
26:45 - projects i know i can't show them all

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch do you feel lucky well do ya because today our classic platformer is suddenly looking a lot more dangerous yes we are going to add some very pointy spikes and some very hot lava i don't think scratchy or guy will thank you for this unless they happen to be adrenaline junkies and then perhaps they will so write off what do we do yes be a good coder and save a copy of your project this is episode 7. okay let's get scratching run the project i'm going to just scout my level for a good place to add some danger yes i think scene 2 is a prime target now the way i'm going to do this is to make a duplicate of the level sprite and we'll rename it danger positions a little off as you can see on the project stage but we can just click the green flag and that'll all snap together sweet so open the danger sprite costumes do make absolutely sure you are editing the dangerous sprite costumes and not the level sprites costumes you don't want to lose your carefully drawn levels have you checked really okay then within the scene 2 costume of the danger sprite i am now drawing a very very i mean seriously killer red square that will with a little cunning manipulation soon become a deadly red triangle or even a red spike yes that's what it is maybe even three spikes more pointy perhaps yeah good so this is where things get interesting we now have to remove everything from this costume that is not deadly delete delete delete here we go cleaning up nice now you should see the spikes showing in a stage alongside the level that we of course didn't delete by mistake after all my warnings good job so then we now also have to delete all the other costumes from the danger sprite just leaving this one let's run the project hold the phone why are those spikes showing on scene one do you know well it's because we are always showing the danger sprite and this is the only danger costume available so it will always show to fix this we don't have to have a danger costume for every scene in our level no make a new blank costume and name it blank then in our scripts find the when i receive change scene receiver when we change scene we try to change the danger costume to the given scene name now we do have a scene 2 danger costume but we don't have a scene 1. when you change to a nonexistent costume scratch stays on the last costume it was set to so it doesn't end up changing to address this we add a new switch costume above the first and switch to the blank costume now if the second costume change doesn't work we'll remain on the blank costume that's neat running that now and you can see those horrible scary pointy things have vanished few however i highly suspect if i walk into the next screen oh they're horrible oh no oh wait this is what we wanted so yes i can just test popping back and forward between two scenes to ensure the dangerous sprite only appears at the right time great so i guess now we need to finally face our greatest fear and touch the oh oh i'm alive gosh they look so deadly too it appears we have more work to do click into the player sprite now when we lose a life we are going to want for the time being to make use of this define reset and begin level script before we proceed to do that we can make a simplification we'll use the begin scene custom block we already use this to change scenes when walking off the edge of a scene but we can use it here now as well fill in the scene number with a 1 matching the set scene from the top which we can now delete next set the x to negative 150 and the y to 55 and that's it it replaces these last three blocks completely as it also performs these broadcasts itself smash the green flag just to make sure everything is still ticketyboo yep we are spawning just the same and when we restart from another scene we appear back on scene 1. good you know what's been bugging me drop in a point in direction block here and set it to 90. i prefer is to point the same way each time we start right let's lose a life find the when i receive tick last script the best place to look for collisions with dangerous sprites is here after everything is finished moving and the costumes are all displayed at the bottom if touching danger then we'll now broadcast a new message lose life this is going to be real simple find some space and when i receive lose life start by stopping all the other scripts in this sprite that stops the main game loop right away otherwise things would really mess up now you can play around here with your players lose a life animation or effect i'm just going to fade the player away for starters with a repeat 10 and then change ghost effect by 10. 10 tens is 100 so that does a full fade out then we can wait for half a second 0.5 before we then reset the game reset and begin level are you ready for this here we go progress onto scene 2. sit on a spike ouch we fade away as planned oh bother the good news is we are back on scene one the bad news is that we have appeared to be invisible and of course we are we never reset the ghost effect did we scroll back to the when i receive game loop script we'll simply add a set ghost effect to zero right at the top before the main game loop begins cool let's run that again here we go ouch and yes we have reset i can see scratchy super yes in the words of cap i could do this all day but seriously who would want to we need more spikes more danger more more everything of course adding more spikes to scene two is no problem we can just draw them in and position them by looking at the stage for reference and yep they are just as deadly as their siblings so how about adding danger on another scene like scene one well easy just create another costume for scene 1 naming it carefully as scene 1 capital s then position it again using the stage as a reference and run the project as you can see the costume changing works great and we can have dangers on any scene we want but griff patch what about the uber cool animating lava effect you had in the video from episode one ah right i guess we should add some of that right we could just draw the lava costume like we did the spikes but let me show you how we can also copy costumes to make lining things up easier in the level sprite just drag scene 3 into the dangerous bright and then back in the danger sprite we are free to go to town drawing our danger lava exactly where we want it there and then of course delete the rest of the level as it isn't meant to be dangerous so that leaves our lava pool but it's supposed to be a little more dynamic than that so that we know it's lava we want it to pulse up and down for this we click back into the danger sprite code tab we only want the lava to pulse up and down not the spikes so use an if block in the change scene script checking for when seen is equal to three that's this scene now here's the beauty of this platforming engine although we are using the tick broadcasts because we are not restricting them using broadcast and weights we can still use a forever loop in here to create an animation without worrying about slowing down the rest of the game to make the lava move up and down set y position two now this is a common math script for circular motion we need a multiply on the right a sine operator s i n then in that another multiply on the left use timer okay there are two remaining three values to fill out the left one is how far you want the lava to wibble up and down we'll say five pixels up and down and the right side is how fast you want it to wibble 360 means it will do a full cycle in one second let's see what that looks like oh yeah that is cool but do feel free to play with these values maybe we'll slow it down a bit try 180 to half the speed and tweak the distance maybe just three there isn't that something now if you want to have spikes and lava on the same screen you may want to duplicate this danger sprite into two sprites so that one can move while the other stays still that's the simplest way perhaps but you could also use clones to accomplish the same effect with a single sprite right that is all the teaching i have for now until the next episode where we will be finally looking at moving platforms however before we finish i really want to share with you more of the amazing projects you scratchers have been submitting to the studios can i start with andre's desk ass 1945's project first impressions are like wow look at the art and the animation is awesome oh man there's a hole watch out for that one it's a bit hard to see with all the shades of um sand yeah that's my excuse anyhow there's a bridge nice and look at the wall sliding costume it's excellently done i wonder what game this character is originally from either way this scratcher has done a great job getting them into this project now these platforms are a little bit more tricky i'm really enjoying though playing through this level oh no oh i fell to my death and i'm right back at the start ah you know what we are going to have to cover checkpoints in our platformer series aren't we yeah checkpoints next project up boom bang one one two four eight one six three two what's this press one or two to see the hitbox oh oh cool look you can switch to see the actual hitbox versus the level that you are seeing nothing hidden on this scene ah now this is more interesting see the top platform is a trick and the real entrance is below i like that really cool try going here it says but oh no that was a trick too okay this next project is by john do i want a whirling effect or no let's go for the whirling effect oh oh my goodness it's like the stat whirling effect from that other game but turned up to the nines it's it's really disorientating and maybe perhaps a little bit much i do get a bit travel sick i think i shall try it without oh i feel like the level is still moving right i'm gonna try again up here this level's working really well we can move from screen to screen and the colors are nice i really want to get up here oh i can't do it right i'm going to come back to that i'm sure there's lava and spikes already that's cool um bit of wall jumping watch out for that spike oh that's a tricky one if i just come down a bit yeah and coming back to the left oh oh is this going to link up with that little bit at the top yay celebration i like that right let's try something else this project is by logic cue dev 2. oh it's me that's a ball oh and the level's moving look at that moving platforms how cool wow i'm really boingy it almost feels like a combination of my ball physics project but it may be not quite so but nearly it doesn't roll down these slopes but uh that's cool why i'm so fast oh that's the end of the level oh well it's cool though it's got a lot of potential i like the way the face rolls that's good and it leaves a big trail of me next we have sky high 173 what have you got for us oh this is a pleasant looking level look at the clouds i love that and i've seen this before but maybe in a previous version we got this vertical bit of blah oh well let's try that again okay now i need to watch oh look different music track oh it's nice because i'm going a different way i feel oh oh that was a bit of a sudden uh drop let's be a bit more careful this time i love the background you've seen the hazy like background oh oh the hazy background in this no no no no no no it's a bit harsh let's try that one more time okay here we go here we go here we go here we go i got this i've got this i've got this yes so we can progress on with this level watch out oh it's so harsh it goes right back to the start see we definitely need checkpoints okay this project's by bambang one one two four eight one six three two don't just love these usernames now this one appears to be almost like a bug report there's a known bug that you can wall jump up a wall if you can just press the keys at just the right time and i am not doing very well at that obviously i will not do a very good job of beating this level come on come on come on i can do it hey no got it got it got it there see did you see that oh my goodness you have to do the whole thing on this wall too um there's no way i've got the skill to pull this one off come on come on come on no no there you go maybe you do better okay thank you hello lolly for submitting your project to the studio oh we got a nice soundtrack kind of very pleasant green and blue sky oh rectangular oh whoa okay so we've got some quite tricky little jumps here on the next screen so be careful okay i think i got this getting more difficult as time goes by so gotta be oh wow look at this it's all about getting these jumps right okay it's definitely a little jumping game this one no vertical scrolling on this game whoa whoa whoa whoa oh yes that was a close one you're never quite sure what's gonna come oh my goodness right big jump now yeah i think as long as i do big jumps off the edges of these really tricky bits i'm gonna be oh i'm stuck but i've won hey well done me thank you for that game now scratcher nagoyan you have submitted a very psychedelic project i'm quite a little cat and i can run like the wind and the music's nice going to the air i guess i oh i'm trapped i'm not sure i can get back oh well on to the next then so sabco so this one looks like it follows my tutorial quite well and a bit more colorful than mine oh i like this little side door oh the level's a bit bigger than mine then oh come on come on come on i can climb up here no i can't i better go down okay h t f l m f how on earth would you pronounce that at film one okay you've given us this rather exciting looking black and white project i like that and it's kind of like a happy cube i can wall jump that's cool but i think i'm going to go to the right here it's like film noir version of guy oh look at his lives move could you see that that's really quite cool yeah we're going this is going pretty well i like this this is a bit of a different oh oh no i'm stuck i might love my eyes though good work okay next up sweep sweep 2. look at these lovely colors oh spikes that was lucky oh yeah that resets me right back to the start let's have a look a look over here no no no oh this is a bit harsh right let's go somewhere a bit safer which way to go oh i guess we'll down we go then i think we're the same same oh oh my goodness quite short oh i just teleported through the water oh my goodness on earth's going on i think the uh the scene changing is a little bit uh obscure oh look the spikes disappeared and i fell through the ceiling that wasn't there oh my goodness oh oh my goodness me this is a quite uh quite something oh my goodness oh if i could fall down here oh look at this like it goes super fast i'm gonna have to end at some point my goodness imagine what level i'm really on oh see there's a lovely thing about this engine is that uh because we're doing that clever step thing we can actually fall really really fast and still collide with surfaces that are really thin so that's a really good thing about this engine right let's go on to the next one so this next one's by maths games we've got this nice blue color i like that i like the fact that the level is all contained and it's quite nice it's got like smooth walls and nice gradients and nothing too sharp oh this bit's a bit more rectangular but i like i like the fact that it's all contained up there okay next up we have a zed or at the z we've got some lovely color changing going off here the level and scratch cat the basic platforming says oh yeah we got up and down scrolling there scene changing sorry uh oh that looks like a big spike on the ceiling watch out if i just jump over here whoa oh my goodness oh look it's like a little party zone to be honest it feels like like uh disco okay rapunzel 6262 what have you got for us wow i feel like i'm jumping to this music oh did you hear that pop oh look at the nice gradients i like that oh am i standing on here like sand or something it's quite fun with the big scratch cat and a nice chunky level oh i wonder what i'm going to it's just quite a pleasant little stroll through this little jumping thing oh there we go i like it thank you rapunzel oh i cannot pronounce this one qhrawqekj was that about right but my goodness this is looking like exactly like my initial tutorial level wow i'm impressed that there's a moving platform i seem to be a little bit stuck to it but the lava is working brilliantly so we are going to be covering the moving platforms in the next tutorial and i'll show you how to get them working a little bit better than this but this this is a really good job well done i would say your name but you know i just haven't quite got the uh the language oh lemon i think i've won what an excellent ending thank you for that one next up we have choc unfamilat that's a brilliant username is this like a powerup now i've collected it i think i can actually jump higher than i could before oh that is such a cool idea i love powerups i wonder if there's any more in this level to be found i'll just have a jump around and see another power up so to the right oh look look how fast i can go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh it's like i'm being blown around by some huge wind or something um oh imagine if this is this combined with my jumping i don't think i can jump as high now but imagine if i could jump as high as i did before and had this for this sideways motion it would be absolutely insane right um let's have another one this one is by triple d rv and it's looking pretty similar design to my original project i like that wow i'm so fast i can jump really high it could the problem with making things jump so fast or so high is that it actually can make it quite hard to control because you get stuck to the walls and uh and things but oh no game over i jumped up through the ceiling and got stuck next up is scratchmaker2321 oh now i'm really digging this uh guy oh they've got nice sounds too look at his animation it's fantastic his little arms oh when he jumps he puts his like finger off in the air like cool oh dead oh harsh i don't like dying but it's good it's good yeah we got all their features i do yeah that little jump noise is brilliant and his animation is brilliant too i love it nothing just climb up here i wonder what his wall sliding looks like cool okay i'm getting this now i think i'm gonna we're here though oh oh down down okay let's try that one again this is really quite fun come on then okay so down here now careful now i need to go just the right amount oh right skip back up the top this time i got to be really really careful so how far was it i think a little no not again come on there yes now going careful now come on come on little jumps oh little jumps i know where they are and i can get up here and i saw that thing down at the bottom there so i get it i do you know i guess if i just yeah okay we made it now um can i get up this oh no oh have i come down too early oh i think i've come down too early never mind next one domi12345678 has got the night platformer for us this looks really thematic oh look at the rain oh and a lovely music track too oh that's brilliant and the light beam around me as well oh that's really uh that's really cool it gives a real atmosphere to the game oh i feel like i'm falling down though down every time i move left or right to be going down a level i love the uh i love the graphics they uh quite simple oh green did you see the green what was that how can i get back up there again oh here we go i got it um now is it oh even lighter it's like the higher up i go the brighter it gets if i could just get up if i could wall jump off the right here then i might be able to get over there oh can i even get that oh no it's going darker again i want to get back to the grip there i'm it oh no i'm stuck in a wall oh no oh bob maybe i go right instead okay have i been here before hey i've made it but that oh oh i guess that's it then i guess i've i guess i've seen all the green but it's really nice i love it i think that could be a really good game if we could just expand it out and add a few more things this next one's by eggy revvilis and it's got a really really funky little character i love the way his little feather ripples as he walks along like a little knight i wonder what the wall jump yeah wall jumping works oh look at that little slide you just see his little hand come out oh that's so sweet what's this i'm not sure what that is i don't think it does anything yet i'll just try going off to the left no i'll go to the right now what is this oh no i don't think i can oh i thought it was a little secret way it was just another little platform oh this is intriguing there's all these little ways in this level um can i get across here oh come on jump yay what's over here then oh i'm not gonna make that i think we're back to the start oh i love it though look at that little guy oh i always love his little hand that pops out too it's so sweet i think that's all we've got for this level but that's really cool game i like look at that and dan 47725 has brought us the minecraft platformer and look at that i've got a big rainbow trail as well oh it's a bit of a hyped up minecraft theme i think you've gone to town making this it must have been quite hard to place all these little blocks but it's cool i imagine if you could wall jump like this in minecraft i bet there's a mod for it well i think i found a cave i expect to find a creeper any moment but uh luckily not can i get up here i can't see how i could hmm maybe back no no i think i've found the end of minecraft okay thank you 250119 test 2 for this submission the thumbnail looks beautiful yeah look at this the level design oh i died the graphics are really nice and look we've got checkpoints checkpoints you've beat me to it that's really cool but thank goodness we have got them because my goodness what's this mean then oh oh it's like um on um geometry dash oh oh heck what happened there it's like on oh it's hard to see the spikes i keep oh come on um so i gotta jump over this and then i can bounce on that little yellow thing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my goodness okay come on this time i'm going to jump on it and right now where do i go about down here watch oh it's just so fast and you don't know what's coming okay fast forward through this okay right so now i can bounce on this yellow thing and me no no i really can't how about we just go right here instead ah i'm on the other side everybody's meant to go no i seem to die an awful lot oh yes did i make it when you made a new screen i know i can't get there down here then oh yeah down here checkpoints are excellent whoa complicated this is cool so i guess i go left oh secret room a secret room but i want to go across oh checkpoint yeah good oh oh my goodness it feels like geometry dashing it's the same sound we could do it like a particle explosion couldn't we so
