00:00 - foreign
00:03 - scratchers particle simulations are
00:06 - crazy cool and they are like the icing
00:09 - on the cake for many projects elevating
00:11 - a game from good to awesome over the
00:15 - course of the next two videos we are
00:17 - going to be creating some absolutely
00:19 - beautiful particle simulations from
00:22 - particle streams fizzing trails to
00:24 - explosions with collisions and awesome
00:26 - sound effects wow I cannot wait to get
00:29 - started the colors and the sounds really
00:31 - make it so satisfying to watch and it
00:34 - gets me so excited as I can imagine it's
00:36 - looking awesome in any scratch game
00:38 - right just too cool so guys are you
00:42 - ready let's get scratching
00:45 - we'll Begin by creating a shiny new
00:48 - scratch project particles
00:50 - our first step is to create the initial
00:52 - particle stream firing our new particle
00:54 - clones that follow a curve back down to
00:57 - the ground we'll set the scene in the
00:59 - background Sprite filling the entire
01:01 - Canvas black against this our particles
01:04 - will show up really bright and colorful
01:07 - then back in Sprite 1 sorry scratchy I'm
01:11 - replacing you with a small red circle
01:13 - Zoom right in and draw it around the
01:16 - size of one of these grid squares that's
01:18 - four by four pixels
01:19 - then make absolutely sure to drag our
01:23 - Circle to snap it in the center of the
01:25 - costume canvas like so don't miss that
01:28 - step otherwise your particles won't be
01:30 - positioned quite right
01:32 - and now it's coding time let's fire off
01:36 - some new particles shall we when flag
01:39 - clicked and we hide Yep this original
01:42 - particle Sprite is a clone Factory
01:44 - you've probably heard me set before it
01:46 - will create many visible particle clones
01:48 - but doesn't itself want to be visible
01:51 - then we Loop forever
01:54 - firstly waiting for the mouse button to
01:57 - be down and then we want to create
01:59 - particles now but thinking ahead if we
02:02 - want to create more than one particle at
02:04 - a time then we'll need this next bit to
02:06 - be in a custom block so create a new
02:09 - block naming it create particles at
02:14 - with an input of x
02:16 - and another why and of course we tick
02:20 - the run without screen refresh
02:22 - that will do fine drop the Block in
02:25 - after the mouse is down here
02:29 - for this demo project we'll spawn the
02:31 - new particles at the mouse cursor mousex
02:34 - and mouse y but you can enter in any
02:37 - position you like into these inputs
02:39 - so next up in our custom block we go to
02:43 - X Y of the past in X and Y inputs
02:49 - what we need next is to Define how fast
02:52 - our particles are moving
02:54 - make two new variables
02:56 - speed X for this Sprite only
02:59 - and speed y
03:02 - they need to be for this byte only
03:03 - because each particle wants to be able
03:06 - to move in a different direction with
03:08 - different speeds otherwise with for all
03:10 - Sprites all the particles would end up
03:12 - moving the same direction in a kind of
03:14 - grand dance not really what we're after
03:16 - gosh no okay so just for now let's set
03:20 - the initial speed X to six and speed y
03:24 - to 12.
03:26 - and finally we get to create the clone
03:29 - of myself the cloned particle Sprite
03:31 - will take on the same position and
03:33 - speeds that we just set
03:35 - almost there when I start as a clone
03:39 - first we'll show the Sprite remember
03:41 - that it was originally hidden
03:44 - then Loop forever so that we can animate
03:47 - this sucker and I'm going to use a go to
03:50 - XY this might seem like an unusual
03:53 - choice but it's because I need to move
03:55 - both the X and Y positions at the same
03:58 - time in which case we need to reposition
04:01 - the Sprite at the original X position
04:03 - and Y position
04:06 - plus our speed X
04:09 - and our speed y adjustments
04:12 - yay since this Loops forever it should
04:15 - keep moving the particle each screen
04:17 - refresh and will produce the movement
04:19 - animation for the particle let's smash
04:21 - that green flag and run the project pew
04:25 - pew pew yeah now this is fun my little
04:28 - red dots are flying across the screen
04:30 - and makes them rather funky patterns in
04:33 - the process you might have noticed that
04:35 - they appear to be congregating at the
04:36 - top right of the stage however and
04:39 - indeed very soon I've used up all 300 of
04:42 - my available Sprite clones and scratches
04:44 - not willing to yield me anymore shame on
04:47 - you scratch anyhow we can combat this by
04:50 - removing the ones that should have gone
04:52 - off screen
04:54 - if touching Edge
04:59 - then we delete this clone
05:03 - easy as pie
05:05 - and now you can stay here firing off
05:07 - little red particle friends as long as
05:09 - you want and scratch willing you'll be
05:11 - here until someone calls you for tea if
05:13 - you're that lucky
05:15 - but in the meantime particles just don't
05:18 - look good without
05:19 - gravity to pull them down
05:22 - so make a new variable named gravity for
05:26 - all Sprites since gravity is the same
05:28 - for everyone
05:29 - and just after the green flag is clicked
05:32 - set gravity to negative one
05:36 - and to have it take effect drop in a
05:39 - change speed Y block by gravity
05:43 - just before we actually move the Sprite
05:46 - come on then green flag time
05:49 - and
05:51 - yes it's like playing with a hose pipe
05:54 - in your garden really very entertaining
05:56 - and a little mesmerizing to boot I just
05:59 - love the natural forming patterns so
06:02 - cool
06:02 - but now I want to look at how we can use
06:05 - these particles to simulate a sparkler
06:08 - Trail for this we want to fire out a
06:11 - batch of particles in a circle all at
06:13 - once and for this each particle will
06:15 - need a power and a Direction
06:18 - find the create particle script and drop
06:21 - a repeat 10 loop around the set speed
06:24 - and create Cloud blocks
06:26 - this will create 10 clones all at once
06:29 - because we checked the run without
06:31 - screen refresh box for this custom block
06:34 - then create two new variables
06:37 - power for this Sprite only
06:40 - and for the direction also for this
06:43 - Sprite only
06:45 - set these two variables before we begin
06:46 - looping around
06:48 - set der to zero that's straight up and a
06:51 - power of 12.
06:54 - now to calculate the speed X and Y for
06:57 - each particle set speed X to and we need
07:00 - a multiply block
07:02 - the power variable
07:04 - and we multiply by the sine of
07:10 - our Direction variable
07:12 - Isn't that cool so easy do the same for
07:15 - Speed y
07:16 - only remembering to switch the sign for
07:20 - a COS operator
07:22 - lastly change duh by 360. that's the
07:27 - degrees of a circle
07:29 - divided by the number of particles we
07:31 - are firing that's 10. see a full circle
07:34 - in 10 equal steps cool give that a test
07:39 - woohoo it's like having 10 hose pipes
07:42 - all at once now wacky oh look at that ha
07:47 - now it's not perhaps the circle of
07:49 - particles we were imagining so let's up
07:51 - that repeat to 30 particles and
07:54 - consequently divide by 30 as well and
07:58 - then
07:59 - oh man yes now we can see the circle so
08:04 - good but just watch out once we try to
08:07 - create more than 3 000 clones we do
08:10 - start to get weird things happening to
08:12 - our beautiful circles
08:13 - so I'll drop the repeat back down to 10
08:16 - and now rather than creating perfect
08:19 - circles of particles let's try
08:21 - randomizing it a bit and make a sparkler
08:23 - Trail instead
08:25 - for this we remove the change dur block
08:28 - entirely and move the set initial sector
08:31 - and power variables inside the repeat
08:34 - Loop like so now each particle can have
08:36 - its own Direction and power the
08:39 - direction will be a random number
08:40 - between negative
08:43 - 180.0 and 180.0
08:47 - the power is also a random number
08:50 - between 0.0 and 10.0
08:54 - now including the point zero on the end
08:57 - in a random number block allows it to
08:59 - generate fractional numbers and not just
09:01 - the whole numbers you'll get otherwise
09:02 - so this will make our sparklers look
09:05 - much better
09:06 - let's see this in action
09:08 - oh wow look at this how good is that it
09:12 - is just like holding a sparkler again we
09:15 - can have a lot of fun playing with this
09:17 - I can't wait to play with the colors but
09:20 - before we do I want to just talk about
09:22 - air resistance and terminal velocity
09:25 - at present these Sparks float through
09:27 - space and keep accelerating downwards
09:30 - until they are off screen but in reality
09:32 - they should be slowed down by the air
09:35 - that's why fireworks explode out really
09:38 - fast and then slow down as they begin to
09:40 - fall it's the air resistance we can
09:43 - simulate this quite easily too so make a
09:45 - new variable named resist for all
09:48 - Sprites
09:50 - and set it under the gravity
09:54 - to 0.9
09:57 - great so back to the start as clone
10:01 - script
10:02 - where we change speed y now we bring in
10:05 - a set speed X block
10:09 - setting speed X to itself
10:12 - speed X multiplied by the resist
10:15 - variable
10:17 - being a number just less than one this
10:20 - will cause speed X to reduce in speed
10:22 - each time we set it
10:24 - we will do the same for Speed y setting
10:27 - it to speed y multiplied by resist
10:31 - uh but look then we also add gravity to
10:35 - speed y so why don't we drop in an
10:38 - addition block into our set speed y
10:40 - and combine the multiply on the left
10:43 - with the gravity on the right
10:47 - then we can remove the change speed y
10:50 - altogether one less block we'll run that
10:53 - little bit faster right
10:55 - and run the project
10:57 - what we find is the particles no longer
11:00 - spread out anywhere near as widely and
11:03 - they all Begin to Fall together at the
11:05 - same speed this is the effect of air
11:09 - resistance and the particles have
11:11 - reached their terminal velocity the
11:13 - fastest that they can fall before
11:15 - gravity and air resistance equal out
11:17 - it's so interesting
11:19 - to see how this applies to fireworks
11:22 - let's change resist to 0.8 and then in
11:26 - the create particle script change the
11:28 - power all the way up to 30.0
11:33 - there do you see how the Sparks now
11:35 - shoot out and then slowly fall together
11:38 - just like fireworks anyhow this is a
11:42 - little over the top for our use so put
11:45 - the power back down to 10.0 and then
11:48 - scroll right up
11:49 - and set the resist to a more sensible
11:54 - 0.97 much closer to one
11:57 - just remember you won't see the
11:59 - resistance change until you click the
12:02 - green flag right so did I mention
12:04 - playing with colors might be fun how
12:07 - about we just cycle through different
12:09 - colors as we are creating the clothes
12:11 - in the create particle script drop in a
12:14 - change color by and this needs to be
12:17 - really small as little as 0.2 perhaps
12:21 - don't forget we are creating hundreds of
12:23 - these clones so this will actually
12:25 - change really fast
12:27 - how beautiful is this it's a very
12:30 - magical effect and really brings this
12:32 - project to life I wonder how this will
12:35 - look if we up the number of generated
12:37 - particles to 100.
12:40 - wow just tapping the mouse now generates
12:42 - these awesome firework like blasts of
12:45 - color now that is cool
12:48 - one thing that is perhaps missing here
12:50 - are particle Trails you know how lights
12:53 - leave a motion trail behind it as it
12:56 - moves these particles if paused are
12:58 - perfect dots what I would prefer is for
13:01 - them to look like this
13:03 - so how can we do that the answer is with
13:07 - the pen extension I'll just put my
13:10 - repeat back to 10 items and then click
13:13 - into the extension add-ons
13:15 - enable the pen extension whoo nice new
13:19 - blocks to play with find with me the
13:21 - when I start as clone script so as a new
13:24 - particle is created we can start by
13:27 - setting the pen size to 2 pixels that
13:30 - makes sure our lines are a little more
13:32 - chunky then before we move this Sprite
13:35 - stuff in a pen down to begin drawing a
13:37 - line
13:38 - and then right after we've moved we use
13:40 - a pen up to finish drawing again
13:42 - this way each particle will Trace its
13:45 - last movement as a single Short Line on
13:47 - the stage canvas well that sounds cool
13:50 - but what does it look like
13:52 - wow Trails indeed only these trails are
13:56 - all blue and not matching our particle
13:58 - colors
13:59 - easy fix find the change color block
14:01 - before we clone to these particles and
14:04 - pop in the equivalent change pen color
14:07 - changing it again by 0.2 right let's
14:11 - give that a spin color change confirmed
14:15 - nice now if you're wondering why the
14:17 - trail color is not the same as the
14:19 - Sprite color is because the Sprite color
14:22 - effect ranges from 0 to 200 but the pen
14:26 - color effect ranges from zero to one
14:28 - hundred and one go figure anyhow these
14:32 - trails are just way too long they
14:34 - persist forever let's stop that
14:37 - we'll make a new Sprite but before that
14:40 - change the name of sprite 1 to the more
14:42 - sensible particles
14:45 - and now make that new Sprite naming it
14:48 - curtain we call it this because it is
14:51 - used to cover over things that you'll
14:52 - see for starters when flag clicked
14:57 - and then Loop forever
14:59 - and simply drop in a pen arrays all
15:03 - block
15:04 - and run
15:06 - so the previous particle Trail is erased
15:09 - and then the next lines are redrawn each
15:11 - screen refresh now listen you can see
15:14 - here that the screen has to have been
15:16 - erased before the particles draw their
15:19 - lines so how did I know that this arrays
15:22 - would run first if you wondered that
15:25 - then well done that thought doesn't
15:27 - occur to everyone and the reason this
15:30 - erase runs first is because the forever
15:32 - Loop it is within is started before the
15:35 - forever Loop in any of the particle
15:38 - clones
15:39 - those revolutes don't start running
15:41 - until the Clones are created much later
15:43 - on than this green flag script and this
15:47 - gives the erase all blocks forever Loop
15:49 - priority to run first
15:51 - hey shall we get rid of those bright
15:53 - costumes now that we have these nice pen
15:55 - trails click into the particles Sprite
15:58 - and under the when I started clone
16:00 - you'll see the show block now we could
16:03 - just hide this Sprite instead but we're
16:06 - not going to do that because I presently
16:07 - want to do some Collision detection so
16:10 - instead drop in a set ghost effect
16:14 - to 100 that's fully transparent but
16:17 - still collidable useful
16:21 - there beautiful indeed
16:24 - okay still talking about Trails then you
16:27 - may be thinking it would be even nicer
16:29 - to have longer Trails than this
16:32 - if you want to experiment with that then
16:34 - let's try this back in the curtain
16:36 - Sprite create a fully black costume
16:42 - and then in place of the eraser
16:45 - drop in a pen stamp block this will draw
16:49 - that fully black rectangle right over
16:51 - our pen drawings and thus will result in
16:54 - the erasing of the entire scene as
16:55 - before
16:56 - we just need to ensure we position the
16:59 - curtain Sprite in the middle of the
17:00 - screen at zero zero
17:03 - ah but since the curtain is a Sprite it
17:06 - currently shows in front of all our
17:07 - beautiful pens so first we need to hide
17:10 - the curtain Sprite this doesn't stop it
17:12 - from stamping though so that's perfect
17:15 - see it now works just like the arrays
17:18 - block did
17:19 - except that now we have the option to
17:22 - only partially stamp this curtain using
17:25 - a set ghost effect block and setting it
17:28 - to 95 percent that's almost entirely
17:31 - faded away to nothing
17:33 - the fact of this is that everything we
17:36 - paint on the canvas takes a really long
17:38 - time to be erased that's so cool but
17:41 - this is way over the top for my purposes
17:43 - I'm going to set the ghost effect then
17:45 - to 30 percent
17:48 - interestingly you might not think you
17:50 - can see any difference here from our
17:52 - original arrays all solution but if I
17:55 - pause it there can you see the
17:57 - difference it's subtle but it does
18:00 - actually make things feel even more
18:02 - authentic with the movement which is
18:03 - what we are after feel free to play with
18:06 - this and the other values in this
18:08 - project and just have a whole lot of fun
18:10 - experimenting it's what I do but I'm
18:13 - afraid this is the end of this episode
18:16 - but not of this tutorial yes part two
18:19 - will be coming very soon and we'll be
18:21 - adding the collisions the particle
18:23 - bounce and some fantastic sound effects
18:26 - to really round off the package if

Cleaned transcript:

foreign scratchers particle simulations are crazy cool and they are like the icing on the cake for many projects elevating a game from good to awesome over the course of the next two videos we are going to be creating some absolutely beautiful particle simulations from particle streams fizzing trails to explosions with collisions and awesome sound effects wow I cannot wait to get started the colors and the sounds really make it so satisfying to watch and it gets me so excited as I can imagine it's looking awesome in any scratch game right just too cool so guys are you ready let's get scratching we'll Begin by creating a shiny new scratch project particles our first step is to create the initial particle stream firing our new particle clones that follow a curve back down to the ground we'll set the scene in the background Sprite filling the entire Canvas black against this our particles will show up really bright and colorful then back in Sprite 1 sorry scratchy I'm replacing you with a small red circle Zoom right in and draw it around the size of one of these grid squares that's four by four pixels then make absolutely sure to drag our Circle to snap it in the center of the costume canvas like so don't miss that step otherwise your particles won't be positioned quite right and now it's coding time let's fire off some new particles shall we when flag clicked and we hide Yep this original particle Sprite is a clone Factory you've probably heard me set before it will create many visible particle clones but doesn't itself want to be visible then we Loop forever firstly waiting for the mouse button to be down and then we want to create particles now but thinking ahead if we want to create more than one particle at a time then we'll need this next bit to be in a custom block so create a new block naming it create particles at with an input of x and another why and of course we tick the run without screen refresh that will do fine drop the Block in after the mouse is down here for this demo project we'll spawn the new particles at the mouse cursor mousex and mouse y but you can enter in any position you like into these inputs so next up in our custom block we go to X Y of the past in X and Y inputs what we need next is to Define how fast our particles are moving make two new variables speed X for this Sprite only and speed y they need to be for this byte only because each particle wants to be able to move in a different direction with different speeds otherwise with for all Sprites all the particles would end up moving the same direction in a kind of grand dance not really what we're after gosh no okay so just for now let's set the initial speed X to six and speed y to 12. and finally we get to create the clone of myself the cloned particle Sprite will take on the same position and speeds that we just set almost there when I start as a clone first we'll show the Sprite remember that it was originally hidden then Loop forever so that we can animate this sucker and I'm going to use a go to XY this might seem like an unusual choice but it's because I need to move both the X and Y positions at the same time in which case we need to reposition the Sprite at the original X position and Y position plus our speed X and our speed y adjustments yay since this Loops forever it should keep moving the particle each screen refresh and will produce the movement animation for the particle let's smash that green flag and run the project pew pew pew yeah now this is fun my little red dots are flying across the screen and makes them rather funky patterns in the process you might have noticed that they appear to be congregating at the top right of the stage however and indeed very soon I've used up all 300 of my available Sprite clones and scratches not willing to yield me anymore shame on you scratch anyhow we can combat this by removing the ones that should have gone off screen if touching Edge then we delete this clone easy as pie and now you can stay here firing off little red particle friends as long as you want and scratch willing you'll be here until someone calls you for tea if you're that lucky but in the meantime particles just don't look good without gravity to pull them down so make a new variable named gravity for all Sprites since gravity is the same for everyone and just after the green flag is clicked set gravity to negative one and to have it take effect drop in a change speed Y block by gravity just before we actually move the Sprite come on then green flag time and yes it's like playing with a hose pipe in your garden really very entertaining and a little mesmerizing to boot I just love the natural forming patterns so cool but now I want to look at how we can use these particles to simulate a sparkler Trail for this we want to fire out a batch of particles in a circle all at once and for this each particle will need a power and a Direction find the create particle script and drop a repeat 10 loop around the set speed and create Cloud blocks this will create 10 clones all at once because we checked the run without screen refresh box for this custom block then create two new variables power for this Sprite only and for the direction also for this Sprite only set these two variables before we begin looping around set der to zero that's straight up and a power of 12. now to calculate the speed X and Y for each particle set speed X to and we need a multiply block the power variable and we multiply by the sine of our Direction variable Isn't that cool so easy do the same for Speed y only remembering to switch the sign for a COS operator lastly change duh by 360. that's the degrees of a circle divided by the number of particles we are firing that's 10. see a full circle in 10 equal steps cool give that a test woohoo it's like having 10 hose pipes all at once now wacky oh look at that ha now it's not perhaps the circle of particles we were imagining so let's up that repeat to 30 particles and consequently divide by 30 as well and then oh man yes now we can see the circle so good but just watch out once we try to create more than 3 000 clones we do start to get weird things happening to our beautiful circles so I'll drop the repeat back down to 10 and now rather than creating perfect circles of particles let's try randomizing it a bit and make a sparkler Trail instead for this we remove the change dur block entirely and move the set initial sector and power variables inside the repeat Loop like so now each particle can have its own Direction and power the direction will be a random number between negative 180.0 and 180.0 the power is also a random number between 0.0 and 10.0 now including the point zero on the end in a random number block allows it to generate fractional numbers and not just the whole numbers you'll get otherwise so this will make our sparklers look much better let's see this in action oh wow look at this how good is that it is just like holding a sparkler again we can have a lot of fun playing with this I can't wait to play with the colors but before we do I want to just talk about air resistance and terminal velocity at present these Sparks float through space and keep accelerating downwards until they are off screen but in reality they should be slowed down by the air that's why fireworks explode out really fast and then slow down as they begin to fall it's the air resistance we can simulate this quite easily too so make a new variable named resist for all Sprites and set it under the gravity to 0.9 great so back to the start as clone script where we change speed y now we bring in a set speed X block setting speed X to itself speed X multiplied by the resist variable being a number just less than one this will cause speed X to reduce in speed each time we set it we will do the same for Speed y setting it to speed y multiplied by resist uh but look then we also add gravity to speed y so why don't we drop in an addition block into our set speed y and combine the multiply on the left with the gravity on the right then we can remove the change speed y altogether one less block we'll run that little bit faster right and run the project what we find is the particles no longer spread out anywhere near as widely and they all Begin to Fall together at the same speed this is the effect of air resistance and the particles have reached their terminal velocity the fastest that they can fall before gravity and air resistance equal out it's so interesting to see how this applies to fireworks let's change resist to 0.8 and then in the create particle script change the power all the way up to 30.0 there do you see how the Sparks now shoot out and then slowly fall together just like fireworks anyhow this is a little over the top for our use so put the power back down to 10.0 and then scroll right up and set the resist to a more sensible 0.97 much closer to one just remember you won't see the resistance change until you click the green flag right so did I mention playing with colors might be fun how about we just cycle through different colors as we are creating the clothes in the create particle script drop in a change color by and this needs to be really small as little as 0.2 perhaps don't forget we are creating hundreds of these clones so this will actually change really fast how beautiful is this it's a very magical effect and really brings this project to life I wonder how this will look if we up the number of generated particles to 100. wow just tapping the mouse now generates these awesome firework like blasts of color now that is cool one thing that is perhaps missing here are particle Trails you know how lights leave a motion trail behind it as it moves these particles if paused are perfect dots what I would prefer is for them to look like this so how can we do that the answer is with the pen extension I'll just put my repeat back to 10 items and then click into the extension addons enable the pen extension whoo nice new blocks to play with find with me the when I start as clone script so as a new particle is created we can start by setting the pen size to 2 pixels that makes sure our lines are a little more chunky then before we move this Sprite stuff in a pen down to begin drawing a line and then right after we've moved we use a pen up to finish drawing again this way each particle will Trace its last movement as a single Short Line on the stage canvas well that sounds cool but what does it look like wow Trails indeed only these trails are all blue and not matching our particle colors easy fix find the change color block before we clone to these particles and pop in the equivalent change pen color changing it again by 0.2 right let's give that a spin color change confirmed nice now if you're wondering why the trail color is not the same as the Sprite color is because the Sprite color effect ranges from 0 to 200 but the pen color effect ranges from zero to one hundred and one go figure anyhow these trails are just way too long they persist forever let's stop that we'll make a new Sprite but before that change the name of sprite 1 to the more sensible particles and now make that new Sprite naming it curtain we call it this because it is used to cover over things that you'll see for starters when flag clicked and then Loop forever and simply drop in a pen arrays all block and run so the previous particle Trail is erased and then the next lines are redrawn each screen refresh now listen you can see here that the screen has to have been erased before the particles draw their lines so how did I know that this arrays would run first if you wondered that then well done that thought doesn't occur to everyone and the reason this erase runs first is because the forever Loop it is within is started before the forever Loop in any of the particle clones those revolutes don't start running until the Clones are created much later on than this green flag script and this gives the erase all blocks forever Loop priority to run first hey shall we get rid of those bright costumes now that we have these nice pen trails click into the particles Sprite and under the when I started clone you'll see the show block now we could just hide this Sprite instead but we're not going to do that because I presently want to do some Collision detection so instead drop in a set ghost effect to 100 that's fully transparent but still collidable useful there beautiful indeed okay still talking about Trails then you may be thinking it would be even nicer to have longer Trails than this if you want to experiment with that then let's try this back in the curtain Sprite create a fully black costume and then in place of the eraser drop in a pen stamp block this will draw that fully black rectangle right over our pen drawings and thus will result in the erasing of the entire scene as before we just need to ensure we position the curtain Sprite in the middle of the screen at zero zero ah but since the curtain is a Sprite it currently shows in front of all our beautiful pens so first we need to hide the curtain Sprite this doesn't stop it from stamping though so that's perfect see it now works just like the arrays block did except that now we have the option to only partially stamp this curtain using a set ghost effect block and setting it to 95 percent that's almost entirely faded away to nothing the fact of this is that everything we paint on the canvas takes a really long time to be erased that's so cool but this is way over the top for my purposes I'm going to set the ghost effect then to 30 percent interestingly you might not think you can see any difference here from our original arrays all solution but if I pause it there can you see the difference it's subtle but it does actually make things feel even more authentic with the movement which is what we are after feel free to play with this and the other values in this project and just have a whole lot of fun experimenting it's what I do but I'm afraid this is the end of this episode but not of this tutorial yes part two will be coming very soon and we'll be adding the collisions the particle bounce and some fantastic sound effects to really round off the package if you've enjoyed what you've seen so far then please do smash
