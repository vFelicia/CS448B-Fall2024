00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers I've always
00:04 - wanted to create more engaging animated
00:07 - characters in my scratch games but
00:09 - that's never been easy until now so yeah
00:13 - over the holiday season I got Co which
00:16 - was not nice but it did give me a little
00:18 - time to consider coding a new scratch
00:20 - game and to try out a fun tool for
00:24 - character animation called spriter now
00:26 - it's by Brash monkey and yes there's a
00:28 - free edition and I'll tell you more
00:30 - about that soon but the game it's going
00:33 - to be a gri patch original a puzzle
00:35 - platformer where the protagonist has to
00:37 - Traverse each level with the aim of
00:39 - pushing together similarly colored cubes
00:42 - very simple but with a lot of cool
00:45 - potential what would you say to tagging
00:48 - along to see how the game develops let
00:50 - me share my journey from character
00:52 - design to animation and show you how I
00:54 - began to build up this exciting new
00:56 - scratch game so I didn't really have a
00:59 - firm idea of what my game's player
01:01 - character was going to look like so I
01:03 - turned to the flavor of the month chat
01:05 - GPT for inspiration interestingly it
01:08 - suggested a robot as the main
01:10 - protagonist now I hadn't thought of that
01:12 - and I liked it and with a little more
01:14 - prompting I got a very cool image not
01:17 - sure why this one has one eye or where
01:21 - this poor guy's body went but this one I
01:24 - love so I took this design and I
01:27 - recreated it using mainly rectang
01:30 - in a vector image editor I used
01:32 - illustrator for this purpose but
01:34 - inkscape or the scratch editor would
01:36 - also suffice the important thing is that
01:39 - the design is simple enough that it
01:41 - looks good both big and when shrunk
01:44 - right down teeny small since that is how
01:47 - it will probably look in game now that I
01:50 - had the finished design I wanted to
01:52 - animate it and usually this would be a
01:54 - real pain in the butt but today I'm
01:57 - getting a helpful hand from Sprite
02:00 - this bit of software by Brash monkey is
02:02 - available as a free or a pro license and
02:05 - you'll find a link to it under this
02:07 - video this is the bundled example
02:09 - showing a fully rigged character
02:11 - assembled using bones and key frame
02:13 - poses to produce a smooth animated walk
02:16 - cycle very cool indeed I was stoked to
02:21 - give it a try you have to start by
02:23 - saving the individual Parts limbs head
02:26 - feet Etc of the player character into a
02:28 - folder on your computer
02:30 - this can then be opened as a new project
02:32 - within spriter and reassembled as
02:35 - intended so the next step is to add in a
02:38 - skelington rig of Bones to hold it all
02:40 - together and Define where the components
02:43 - can pivot and move finally link the
02:46 - images to the bones and the rig is
02:49 - complete and now just a word of warning
02:52 - do watch the sprited tutorials before
02:54 - trying this out yourselves as it was far
02:56 - from obvious how to go about this even
02:58 - for me then it was a matter of trial and
03:01 - error constantly referring back to Brash
03:03 - monkey example project and after a
03:06 - relatively short time my beautiful robot
03:09 - walk cycle emerged and I have to say it
03:12 - came out pretty sweet so much so that I
03:16 - went ahead and created an idol animation
03:18 - too for when they're standing still I
03:21 - guess robots don't really breathe but me
03:24 - it looks cool and helps bring the game
03:27 - to life so it was super super easy to
03:30 - export the animations making them ready
03:32 - to be imported back into scratch it's
03:34 - just a shame that they had to be bit map
03:37 - I think the best compromise is to export
03:40 - twice as large as we need and then
03:43 - shrink the Sprites down to 50% in
03:45 - scratch and it seems to work best when
03:48 - the costumes are an even height and
03:50 - width but man a blank scratch project is
03:54 - always a bit daunting there's so much
03:57 - work involved in coding a game from
04:00 - from
04:01 - scratch so why not reuse one of my
04:05 - tutorial projects episode 13 of my tile
04:08 - scrolling platformer for example would
04:10 - be a splendid starting point it's tile
04:13 - based has great platforming scripts and
04:16 - a built-in level editor and encoding so
04:19 - sure it's a bit Mario themed right now
04:22 - but it doesn't take much to replace your
04:24 - players
04:27 - costumes very exciting and the level
04:30 - tile costumes too now I had to quickly
04:32 - knock up some bricks and a shiny Red
04:34 - Cube to be pushed around then scrap that
04:37 - annoying music Rec configure a few
04:40 - scratch lists and then with a level
04:42 - editor working I could mock up a quick
04:46 - level awesome and here we
04:49 - go okay no animation yet just the basic
04:53 - standing frame but it looks good and the
04:56 - movement around the level is all there
04:58 - the Collision detection is all almost
05:00 - right I'll make sure to tidy that up
05:02 - shortly but first let's get the player
05:05 - animations working I found the paint
05:08 - Sprite script and added in both the idle
05:11 - animation for when speedex is zero and
05:13 - otherwise we're walking beginning at
05:16 - costume 12 and cycling through for the
05:18 - next 12 costumes let's see that in
05:21 - action and there it is all of my hard
05:25 - work finally paying off and yes Vector
05:28 - art would have looked a bit smoother but
05:30 - that bit map 50% scaling trick does seem
05:33 - to be working pretty well for you what
05:35 - do you think of the look of
05:39 - [Music]
05:43 - this now let's fix the player height a
05:47 - simple change to the player's height
05:49 - variable there we
05:52 - go but there is another problem head
05:55 - collisions are not pixel accurate and
05:58 - I'm getting snagged on this this block
06:00 - after a little think I realized it was
06:02 - due to how I checked for collisions at
06:04 - my head level by adding the height
06:06 - variable which is actually half height
06:08 - and that's fine for detecting feet
06:10 - collisions but in a tile grid this point
06:13 - represents the tile above the player so
06:16 - I need to bring this down by a tiny
06:19 - amount which we actually already are
06:21 - doing for the width
06:23 - don't excellent bug
06:26 - squashed so the basic platforming had
06:29 - all fallen into place real fast that is
06:32 - assuming we actually want to move around
06:34 - like Mario well actually no in my cubes
06:38 - game the player character shouldn't be
06:40 - able to jump what so how do they get
06:44 - around well when it comes to these cubes
06:47 - I want the robot to be able to climb up
06:48 - over them and for that I will need
06:51 - spriter once more to sketch out a fun
06:54 - climbing animation I already had a cube
06:57 - of the correct size which I could import
07:00 - and that was the starting point the next
07:02 - pose would have the player jumping up
07:04 - and grabbing the top of the cube I
07:06 - wasn't exactly sure what I was doing
07:08 - something like this perhaps and of
07:11 - course the final pose would have the
07:12 - player Standing On Top of the cube now I
07:16 - just needed to create a realistic
07:18 - scrambling pose to fit in the gaps
07:21 - perhaps if the back leg could reach up
07:23 - next along with the hands and then then
07:27 - with the hands on top they could push
07:28 - the player back to their feet yeah lots
07:31 - of back and forward tweaking until
07:34 - finally I had something that looked like
07:37 - this now you might think the animation
07:39 - looks a bit too fast and smooth but
07:42 - don't forget that when played in game
07:44 - this action will be repeated over and
07:46 - over and if they climbed too slowly then
07:49 - it will end up getting annoying so this
07:52 - was my compromise with the cube hidden I
07:55 - can now export the frames and the fun
07:58 - bit importing it into
08:01 - scratch a new player action climb Cube
08:06 - animating the costume 24 and onwards and
08:10 - for the time being I'll replace the
08:11 - jumping code with a simple change to the
08:14 - climb Cube action starting at frame zero
08:18 - so while climbing all other player
08:20 - actions are disabled we just play back
08:23 - the climbing animation half a frame at a
08:26 - time to keep it slow and once it ends I
08:29 - reset the action and let the game
08:31 - continue and look at this it plays back
08:35 - real nice now obviously we shouldn't be
08:38 - able to climb up into another block and
08:41 - we shouldn't teleport back down to the
08:43 - floor afterwards and we shouldn't be
08:46 - able to climb into thin air but that's
08:48 - all fixable stuff and this animation is
08:52 - looking Sweet let's fix this teleporting
08:55 - issue the climbing animation has our
08:58 - player climb up the block and end at the
09:00 - top but in reality this Sprite hasn't
09:03 - moved it's just an animation so on
09:05 - finishing we appear back at the starting
09:08 - point to fix this we must end by
09:10 - physically moving the player to match
09:12 - the end frame I'll try changing x x 16
09:15 - that's half a tile and changing y by 32
09:18 - a whole tile
09:20 - up oh my gosh that was a good guess it's
09:24 - spot on and man it is fun running around
09:27 - climbing over blocks and it's the player
09:29 - animations that really bring this to
09:31 - life oh oops I need to account for the
09:33 - climbing left too I can use that old
09:36 - Direction divided by 90
09:40 - trick very smooth I wonder if this is
09:43 - getting you excited to try out some key
09:45 - frame animations yourself you know what
09:47 - I'll pop a link to a studio under the
09:49 - video in case you manag to create
09:51 - anything with spriter that you want to
09:52 - share but perhaps I'll need to make you
09:54 - a dedicated tutorial first let me know
09:57 - in the
09:58 - comments well that is very entertaining
10:01 - but it's definitely not right I need to
10:03 - enforce some ground rules climbing
10:06 - requires a solid Block in front of the
10:08 - player and that block must not have
10:10 - another solid block on top of it I can
10:13 - use the old get TI app Block adjusting
10:15 - the X to look ahead of the player that
10:17 - will confirm the Block in front is solid
10:19 - and then the block above we need to add
10:21 - 32 to their y position and confirm that
10:24 - the tile is not solid not a
10:27 - hash I can now clim up to the right
10:30 - which is great but not to the left hm
10:33 - hold on let's try a larger
10:37 - offset sort it it's nice that the level
10:40 - is starting to feel solid and the
10:42 - animations make it all the more
10:45 - believable now I've left the best to
10:48 - last the bread and butter of this puzzle
10:50 - platformer I need an animation for the
10:53 - player pushing a cube across the floor
10:56 - now I thought I might be able to clone
10:57 - the original walk cycle and go from
11:00 - there but after tilting them forward I
11:02 - quickly realized that this caused too
11:04 - much of a change to the rest of the
11:06 - bones so after getting the limbs in
11:08 - position I scrapped the rest of the
11:10 - animation and began working at it fresh
11:12 - it was helpful to keep referencing back
11:14 - to my previous walk
11:17 - animation now I'm not saying spriter
11:19 - does all the work for you far from it
11:22 - but the results are really very
11:25 - satisfying I think this is pretty
11:27 - believable
11:32 - let's get it into
11:34 - scratch here they are now I simply
11:37 - switch to display the push animation
11:39 - whenever the space key is held down it
11:41 - looks a bit like they are sleep running
11:44 - sleep running a thing anyhow they're
11:46 - moving far too fast to really do the
11:48 - animation any justice hold on I can fix
11:52 - that there we go rather than switching
11:55 - to the idle animation when pushing
11:57 - against a solid wall I now now continue
11:59 - to play the pushing animation just very
12:02 - slowly and now we can really see every
12:04 - frame and it's very smooth indeed but
12:08 - I'm not quite done yet as we can still
12:10 - do the push moonwalk oh and if you are
12:14 - wondering why this second cube is no
12:16 - longer solid well I've begun the job of
12:19 - switching over to making the cubes enemy
12:21 - entity Sprites of their own and as such
12:25 - they are no longer solid until that is I
12:28 - make them solid again
12:29 - I know so confusing but I hope you'll
12:32 - tune in to the next episode where I'll
12:35 - attempt to make these cubes pushable
12:38 - yeah that's where the coding really
12:40 - starts to heat up how many cubes can you
12:43 - push what happens to cubes on top of
12:45 - other cubes do cubes fall when pushed
12:48 - off a ledge and how do we get this all
12:50 - to work together it sure is an exciting
12:54 - journey and I can't wait to actually
12:56 - share this game with you so watch out on
12:58 - my Rift patch profile as I begin to
13:00 - share early Alpha releases so that you
13:03 - can follow my progress thanks guys for

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers I've always wanted to create more engaging animated characters in my scratch games but that's never been easy until now so yeah over the holiday season I got Co which was not nice but it did give me a little time to consider coding a new scratch game and to try out a fun tool for character animation called spriter now it's by Brash monkey and yes there's a free edition and I'll tell you more about that soon but the game it's going to be a gri patch original a puzzle platformer where the protagonist has to Traverse each level with the aim of pushing together similarly colored cubes very simple but with a lot of cool potential what would you say to tagging along to see how the game develops let me share my journey from character design to animation and show you how I began to build up this exciting new scratch game so I didn't really have a firm idea of what my game's player character was going to look like so I turned to the flavor of the month chat GPT for inspiration interestingly it suggested a robot as the main protagonist now I hadn't thought of that and I liked it and with a little more prompting I got a very cool image not sure why this one has

monkey is available as a free or a pro license and you'll find a link to it under this video this is the bundled example showing a fully rigged character assembled using bones and key frame poses to produce a smooth animated walk cycle very cool indeed I was stoked to give it a try you have to start by saving the individual Parts limbs head feet Etc of the player character into a folder on your

walk cycle emerged and I have to say it came out pretty sweet so much so that I went ahead and created an idol animation too for when they're standing still I guess robots don't really breathe but me it looks cool and helps bring the game to life so it was super super easy to export the animations making them ready to be imported back into scratch it's just a shame that they had to be bit map I think the best compromise is to export twice as large as we need and then shrink the Sprites down to 50% in scratch and it seems to work best when the costumes are an even height and width but man a
