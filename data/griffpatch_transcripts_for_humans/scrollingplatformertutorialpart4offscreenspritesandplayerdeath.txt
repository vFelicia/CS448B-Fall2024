00:00 - hi I'm Griff patch welcome to part 4 of
00:04 - my scrolling platform tutorial for
00:07 - scratch where we left off this tutorial
00:10 - we had a nice scrolling engine but what
00:14 - was missing was that we have this
00:15 - problem that in scratch as the costumes
00:18 - move off the side of the screen they
00:21 - don't go off so you can still see that
00:23 - left hand side the level from to the
00:25 - left and on the right hand side bits of
00:27 - level from the right so what we need to
00:29 - do is solve that so that these bits
00:31 - level move off the screen and are not
00:33 - visible so let's get straight into it
00:35 - and work on that so what we're gonna do
00:38 - is move into the platform as sprite and
00:43 - we have to change this little script a
00:44 - little bit so the way I like to do this
00:46 - on for a very simple way of doing it is
00:49 - is try and get around this problem of it
00:51 - moving past the edge and stopping now
00:54 - how can we detect that that's happened
00:56 - the best way that I've found is it's
00:59 - follows so what we can do is create a
01:02 - new custom block in the platform of
01:04 - sprite and call it position and add to
01:08 - that by opening up options an x and a y
01:13 - number and we're working without screen
01:16 - refresh like this and move you'll go to
01:22 - into position and move the position
01:27 - block into the tick and you can change
01:30 - this around so you can pass in the X
01:32 - minus scroll X and the y minus scroll Y
01:36 - into the opposition so we're kind of
01:39 - replacing this go to X Y with this
01:41 - position custom block now within here
01:45 - you now want to position it at the
01:48 - position that you've passed in so this
01:50 - is doing pretty much exactly as what it
01:52 - was doing already
01:52 - so the moment should just work just the
01:54 - same so the platform's flights are being
01:56 - positioned just as they were before but
02:00 - now what we can do is a bit of
02:01 - cleverness in here because what happens
02:03 - when you try moving off the screen you
02:05 - tell it to go to a certain position and
02:07 - it's not going to position you wanted it
02:09 - to go to that's why it's stuck to the
02:11 - edge so
02:12 - we can test to see whether it's actually
02:13 - gone to where you wanted it to with a
02:15 - little comparison in here so if we do an
02:19 - if-then-else underneath the go to you
02:23 - want to have an and in this if and then
02:27 - and equals in both sides and put X on
02:35 - one side and Y on the other but then
02:40 - look into the motions block your notice
02:44 - that there's an expedition and a y
02:46 - position in here now this is the
02:47 - position actually the position of the
02:48 - sprite right now so if the position that
02:52 - we wanted a position at is the position
02:55 - that it's actually at in the X and in
02:58 - the Y then it's gone to where we wanted
03:02 - it to go to
03:02 - so we said go to this expedition it's
03:05 - done a go to expedition and then you
03:07 - check to see whether it actually is out
03:08 - that x position and the same with the y
03:11 - so if it is where it's meant to be then
03:15 - we show the sprite the platform and if
03:18 - it isn't where you wanted it and it else
03:20 - you hide it so it's only showing it if
03:23 - it's actually gone where you told it to
03:25 - go
03:25 - it hasn't gone why you told it to go it
03:28 - hides it so let's have a go at that now
03:30 - if you run this every walk across see
03:35 - whether these are disappearing and there
03:37 - you go they are so on the left-hand side
03:39 - here as soon as that goes off disappears
03:42 - it's exactly what we wanted so that is
03:45 - the easiest way I could find to make
03:47 - things go off the screen in scratch 2
03:51 - which is what we're using here there is
03:53 - a bit of a little bit of a performance
03:56 - decrease when you do this when you when
03:59 - you call show every single time you you
04:02 - position it it could actually cause it
04:04 - to slow down a little bit when you're
04:05 - doing some sensing touching not a lot in
04:07 - this particular case but enough that it
04:09 - would would be a problem but that is
04:12 - actually gonna be fixed in scratch 3 and
04:14 - since scratch 3 has just around the
04:16 - corner I'm not going to bother to go any
04:18 - further further detail of how you can
04:19 - make that even better it works just fine
04:21 - in scratch Lee which is really good I'm
04:22 - looking forward to that
04:24 - so what's the next thing we're going to
04:26 - change in this platformer I think the
04:28 - next thing we need is layer death at the
04:31 - moment if I fall fear no I'm still there
04:33 - at the bottom and I'm alive so we need
04:35 - some way of getting the player to die
04:36 - and come start the level off afresh and
04:39 - for that I think we really need to make
04:41 - the level a little bit more serious
04:43 - because at the moment it's all white and
04:44 - happy let's change the game around a
04:47 - little bit let's change the background
04:48 - to black I'll fill in the background
04:51 - black and let's change our level a
04:54 - little bit to let's make this a white
04:58 - platform so we can still see it let's
05:00 - just run that so we can see it yeah
05:01 - there we go we don't need this level
05:04 - anymore let's go do that
05:07 - let's just create some slightly
05:09 - different levels so level part 2 I'll
05:12 - have a filled in let's go yellow I'll
05:16 - make up very simple thing to jump over
05:19 - there okay and that's up another level
05:23 - duplicate that
05:24 - let's have green and what we want is
05:32 - some lava because we love lava in these
05:33 - computer games just draw draw a
05:36 - rectangle I'm here like the previous
05:39 - level and now let's reshape it click to
05:44 - add a new point I will create a little
05:47 - Basin which will fill with lava like
05:52 - this and now if we make another
05:56 - rectangle and a red one for lava or fill
06:00 - this up with lava and I will send that
06:02 - to the back so it's behind the other
06:04 - object there we go
06:06 - a little lava pit so that's to be little
06:08 - levels it's just play that and see if it
06:10 - looks ok there we go and a lava at the
06:15 - moment of course we can just jump on
06:16 - that lava haha that won't be happening
06:18 - for long so first off let's do the let's
06:25 - code up some scripts to let you play a
06:27 - die so I'll need to play a sprite first
06:32 - thing we need is a new variable and
06:34 - we're going to call that exit all
06:36 - capital
06:37 - and it's going to be for all sprites
06:40 - okay stop that being visible and we need
06:44 - to initialize this exit and we'll do
06:47 - that in the game on sprite it's like
06:51 - game on script and we just move this
06:53 - down a bit so we got some space so set
06:57 - exit and we'll set it to empty string so
07:03 - go in there get rid of that zero and
07:05 - just have is empty like that
07:06 - so exits not anything at the moment now
07:09 - the idea this is that when exit gets set
07:11 - that means that some things happen that
07:13 - it's going to cause us to exit from the
07:14 - current game and that's where this
07:17 - repeat in the play game script comes in
07:20 - so the moment repeating until and it
07:23 - just keeps on going forever because
07:24 - nothing's in there but now we're going
07:25 - to change that we're going to need an
07:27 - operator I've greater than pop that into
07:30 - that repeat loop and use the new exit
07:34 - variable I'll just put it like that
07:36 - so when repeat until exit is greater
07:39 - than nothing and that means that end
07:42 - whenever we set the variable exit to
07:44 - anything at all this repeat loops gonna
07:46 - finish and the games gonna end at least
07:47 - it's no drop out of this bit and
07:49 - actually then it's gonna loop around and
07:50 - start the level again which is what some
07:52 - any idea it so when you die or whatever
07:54 - it is I'm going to drop out of the game
07:56 - and then reset the level right now we
08:00 - need the the death animation so let's
08:03 - add in a new custom block and we're
08:06 - going to call this game - die and this
08:13 - is not gonna be run without refresh it's
08:15 - gonna be just like that we want it to be
08:17 - able to refresh the screen this little
08:18 - animation let's get that we need to put
08:22 - that somewhere clean the song and I just
08:24 - move it right over to the right hand
08:26 - side like this okay so what
08:35 - a little animation here it's first of
08:37 - all we're gonna set exit back to empty
08:42 - string like that so no matter what
08:45 - happened or when we die after we've died
08:48 - this exit string is going to be back to
08:51 - blank so the game can continue without
08:52 - exiting that little loop and now we're
08:55 - going to deal with the little death
08:57 - animations let's have a repeat block in
08:58 - here I will get the little character to
09:01 - flash when he dies so I repeat three
09:03 - five five times and we're gonna hide so
09:08 - getting to the hide block that and now
09:11 - we need a weight so that he hides and
09:13 - then he waits before he appears again
09:16 - and we'll just do a really short times a
09:18 - 0.1 second so a tenth of a second and
09:21 - then we'll show and then we'll hide
09:24 - again for another tenth of a second
09:26 - don't need that and that's my loop five
09:29 - times
09:29 - that's just run that if you click on
09:30 - this you can see it running so if I
09:32 - click on that block there we go
09:35 - flash is on and off five times that's a
09:38 - good speed yep I like that
09:41 - okay so now what do we need to do at the
09:44 - end of that so at the moment he ends on
09:47 - the show but we actually want him hidden
09:48 - at the end so let's hide again at the
09:50 - very end after the repeat block and
09:53 - we'll have another wait for half a
09:55 - second just while he's not visible
09:58 - before we then can do anything else so
10:00 - that's our death script so now we need
10:04 - to be able to trigger that death script
10:06 - it says a few places we want to trigger
10:09 - a death one is falling off the edge of
10:11 - the level other one is touching lava or
10:13 - some other type of thing so we'll do the
10:15 - falling off the level first
10:16 - so we're for that one we are going to
10:19 - add a next bit of script to
10:24 - tick the tick the tick custom block I
10:27 - just move that out the way see we've got
10:29 - some space so here's where we're
10:31 - changing player Y you know our current
10:35 - play game script we've got a loop and
10:37 - we've got tick and at the end of it
10:39 - we've got the set scroll Y perhaps call
10:41 - X for the scrolling and the positioning
10:42 - of our person before we broadcast let's
10:44 - move that
10:46 - little bit out of here put the tick back
10:49 - in the broadcast tick and move the
10:51 - scroll X down to the bottom of the tick
10:55 - custom block so in tick now we're doing
10:58 - everything as well as doing the tick of
11:01 - the player we're also setting the scroll
11:03 - and the positioning at the bottom so
11:05 - that's all within tick that makes this a
11:07 - bit cleaner and then at the bottom after
11:10 - we've done the position then we can do
11:12 - our check see if he's fallen off the
11:13 - bottom of the screen or not Zapata put
11:16 - her if condition under the position and
11:19 - I think we need to check is the position
11:22 - of the player why
11:24 - so if position where is the Y the Y
11:28 - position of the player it's less than
11:30 - certain value then we'll kill off the
11:33 - player and we'll choose minus 180
11:36 - because that is at the moment at the
11:39 - bottom of this level here minus 180 is
11:41 - the very smallest value you can have her
11:43 - before he's halfway off the screen so if
11:46 - he's halfway off the screen then we want
11:48 - to set him to be dead so we set and I we
11:52 - change this to be exit I'm gonna set the
11:55 - exit to be the word die so that should
12:01 - as soon as it sets that to die this
12:04 - little loop here will stop working
12:05 - because exit will be greater than
12:07 - nothing and then we'll go down here and
12:10 - what we want to do down here is trigger
12:13 - the death animation so get your game die
12:19 - and pop it there right so can we try
12:25 - that no before we don't know before we
12:29 - try it there's one more thing we need to
12:30 - do something we haven't done yet is
12:32 - reset the level so we've got this loop
12:35 - here once you die you come back round it
12:38 - calls reset with a broadcast and then it
12:41 - calls set up with a broadcast the setup
12:44 - if you look at the platforming sprite
12:46 - here it's what clones the level that
12:49 - creates it so if we go and do that again
12:52 - after we've died it's gonna create
12:54 - another level on top of the previous
12:56 - level and that's not any good it's gonna
12:57 - keep building up more
12:59 - what we haven't got is the reset part so
13:02 - that's adding a new new receiver here
13:06 - when I received there it is so when I
13:09 - receive reset which is broadcast before
13:13 - setup this all I want to do is delete
13:17 - clone delete this clone like that so all
13:24 - of the bits of levels have been created
13:25 - so far we'll all be deleted at that
13:27 - point when reset is called apart from
13:30 - the original one that wasn't a clone so
13:31 - that was to exist about fine cuz then
13:33 - setup will then create the new clones
13:35 - right let's give it a go
13:37 - I think that's ready to go so broadcast
13:39 - so here's our new level looking good
13:43 - let's fall off the bottom and there we
13:45 - are flashes and resets flushes resets
13:52 - flushes recess great there we go we can
13:55 - die now excellent so the next thing to
13:58 - add in is detecting this stuff lava it
14:03 - stopped our project right all the lava
14:06 - we want to add a new custom block of
14:11 - game which we'll be testing whether
14:12 - we're dying so it's quite a new custom
14:15 - block called test - die and I'll do it
14:21 - without run without screen refresh here
14:25 - we go test die and this is just gonna
14:28 - chest where they were touching red at
14:30 - the moment so I'll put a tiff in here
14:33 - and then touching color Oh nope wrong
14:39 - block touching color sorry and we will
14:43 - choose red okay for touching red and we
14:47 - can reuse the existing way of dying so
14:51 - set exit to die okay so if we're
14:57 - touching red we're going to die but
15:00 - where do we call this test form we
15:03 - probably want to call it now whenever we
15:06 - move the position of the player so here
15:10 - we are if we change the pair X
15:12 - change the X reposition and we should
15:15 - probably do it just in there so after we
15:17 - call position we'll also call test I we
15:21 - won't do it in these positions here
15:23 - because that's just getting us back to
15:25 - where we were if we've touched something
15:26 - we shouldn't like a platform we only
15:29 - want to do it as little as possible
15:30 - because touching color is a little bit
15:31 - expensive to call so let's just do it
15:33 - when we first move see if we can move a
15:36 - lot and then again we also want to call
15:38 - it in the change player Y script after
15:40 - that position so test died in there okay
15:44 - let's see if that works
15:47 - so let's go and find that lava there we
15:52 - go
15:52 - touches the lava and is no more all
15:59 - right
15:59 - that's it that's all I wanted to show
16:00 - for this tutorial and we'll add in
16:03 - perhaps some collectibles and things or
16:05 - maybe the new level feature next
16:09 - tutorial all right thank you for
16:11 - watching bye now

Cleaned transcript:

hi I'm Griff patch welcome to part 4 of my scrolling platform tutorial for scratch where we left off this tutorial we had a nice scrolling engine but what was missing was that we have this problem that in scratch as the costumes move off the side of the screen they don't go off so you can still see that left hand side the level from to the left and on the right hand side bits of level from the right so what we need to do is solve that so that these bits level move off the screen and are not visible so let's get straight into it and work on that so what we're gonna do is move into the platform as sprite and we have to change this little script a little bit so the way I like to do this on for a very simple way of doing it is is try and get around this problem of it moving past the

are being positioned just as they were before but now what we can do is a bit of cleverness in here because what happens when you try moving off the screen you tell it to go to a certain position and it's not going to position you wanted it to go to that's why it's stuck to the edge so we can test to see whether it's actually gone to where you wanted it to with a little comparison in here so if we do an ifthenelse underneath the go to you want to have an and in this if and then and equals in both sides and put X on one side and Y on the other but then look into the motions block your notice that there's an expedition and a y position in here now this is the position actually the position of the sprite right now so if the position that we wanted a position at is the position that it's actually at in the X and in the Y then it's gone to where we wanted it to go to so we said go to this expedition it's done a go to expedition and then you check to see whether it actually is out that x position and the same with the y so if it is where it's meant to be then we show the sprite the platform and if it isn't where you wanted it and it else you hide it so it's only showing it if it's actually gone where you told it to go it hasn't gone why you told it to go it hides it so let's have a go at that now if you run this every walk across see whether these are disappearing and there you go they are so on the lefthand side here as soon as that goes off disappears it's exactly what we wanted so that is the easiest way I could find to make things go off the screen in scratch 2 which is what we're using here there is a bit of a little bit of a performance decrease when you do this when you when you call show every single time you you position it it could actually cause it to slow down a little bit when you're doing some sensing touching not a lot in this particular case but enough that it would would be a problem but that is actually gonna be fixed in scratch 3 and since scratch 3 has just around the corner I'm not going to bother to go any further further detail of how you can make that even better it works just fine in scratch Lee which is really good I'm looking forward to that so what's the next thing we're going to change in this platformer I think the next thing we need is layer death at the moment if I fall fear no I'm still there at the bottom and I'm alive so we need some way of getting the player to die and come start the level off afresh and for that I think we really need to make the level a little bit more serious because at the moment it's all white and happy let's change the game around a little bit let's change the background to black I'll fill in the background black and let's change our level a little bit to let's make this a white platform so we can still see it let's just run that so we can see it yeah there we go we don't need this level anymore let's go do that let's just create some slightly different levels so level part 2 I'll have a filled in let's go yellow I'll make up very simple thing to jump over there okay and that's up another level duplicate that let's have green and what we want is some lava because we love lava in these computer games just draw draw a rectangle I'm here like the previous level and now let's reshape it click to add a new point I will create a little Basin which will fill with lava like this and now if we make another rectangle and a red one for lava or fill this up with lava and I will send that to the back so it's behind the other object there we go a little lava pit so that's to be little levels it's just play that and see if it looks ok there we go and a lava at the moment of course we can just jump on that lava haha that won't be happening for long so first off let's do the let's code up some scripts to let you play a die so I'll need to play a sprite first thing we need is a new variable and we're going to call that exit all capital and it's going to be for all sprites okay stop that being visible and we need to initialize this exit and we'll do that in the game on sprite it's like game on script and we just move this down a bit so we got some space so set exit and we'll set it to empty string so go in there get rid of that zero and just have is empty like that so exits not anything at the moment now the idea this is that when exit gets set that means that some things happen that it's going to cause us to exit from the current game and that's where this repeat in the play game script comes in so the moment repeating until and it just keeps on going forever because nothing's in there but now we're going to change that we're going to need an operator I've greater than pop that into that repeat loop and use the new exit variable I'll just put it like that so when repeat until exit is greater than nothing and that means that end whenever we set the variable exit to anything at all this repeat loops gonna finish and the games gonna end at least it's no drop out of this bit and actually then it's gonna loop around and start the level again which is what some any idea it so when you die or whatever it is I'm going to drop out of the game and then reset the level right now we need the the death animation so let's add in a new custom block and we're going to call this game die and this is not gonna be run without refresh it's gonna be just like that we want it to be able to refresh the screen this little animation let's get that we need to put that somewhere clean the song and I just move it right over to the right hand side like this okay so what a little animation here it's first of all we're gonna set exit back to empty string like that so no matter what happened or when we die after we've died this exit string is going to be back to blank so the game can continue without exiting that little loop and now we're going to deal with the little death animations let's have a repeat block in here I will get the little character to flash when he dies so I repeat three five five times and we're gonna hide so getting to the hide block that and now we need a weight so that he hides and then he waits before he appears again and we'll just do a really short times a 0.1 second so a tenth of a second and then we'll show and then we'll hide again for another tenth of a second don't need that and that's my loop five times that's just run that if you click on this you can see it running so if I click on that block there we go flash is on and off five times that's a good speed yep I like that okay so now what do we need to do at the end of that so at the moment he ends on the show but we actually want him hidden at the end so let's hide again at the very end after the repeat block and we'll have another wait for half a second just while he's not visible before we then can do anything else so that's our death script so now we need to be able to trigger that death script it says a few places we want to trigger a death one is falling off the edge of the level other one is touching lava or some other type of thing so we'll do the falling off the level first so we're for that one we are going to add a next bit of script to tick the tick the tick custom block I just move that out the way see we've got some space so here's where we're changing player Y you know our current play game script we've got a loop and we've got tick and at the end of it we've got the set scroll Y perhaps call X for the scrolling and the positioning of our person before we broadcast let's move that little bit out of here put the tick back in the broadcast tick and move the scroll X down to the bottom of the tick custom block so in tick now we're doing everything as well as doing the tick of the player we're also setting the scroll and the positioning at the bottom so that's all within tick that makes this a bit cleaner and then at the bottom after we've done the position then we can do our check see if he's fallen off the bottom of the screen or not Zapata put her if condition under the position and I think we need to check is the position of the player why so if position where is the Y the Y position of the player it's less than certain value then we'll kill off the player and we'll choose minus 180 because that is at the moment at the bottom of this level here minus 180 is the very smallest value you can have her before he's halfway off the screen so if he's halfway off the screen then we want to set him to be dead so we set and I we change this to be exit I'm gonna set the exit to be the word die so that should as soon as it sets that to die this little loop here will stop working because exit will be greater than nothing and then we'll go down here and what we want to do down here is trigger the death animation so get your game die and pop it there right so can we try that no before we don't know before we try it there's one more thing we need to do something we haven't done yet is reset the level so we've got this loop here once you die you come back round it calls reset with a broadcast and then it calls set up with a broadcast the setup if you look at the platforming sprite here it's what clones the level that creates it so if we go and do that again after we've died it's gonna create another level on top of the previous level and that's not any good it's gonna keep building up more what we haven't got is the reset part so that's adding a new new receiver here when I received there it is so when I receive reset which is broadcast before setup this all I want to do is delete clone delete this clone like that so all of the bits of levels have been created so far we'll all be deleted at that point when reset is called apart from the original one that wasn't a clone so that was to exist about fine cuz then setup will then create the new clones right let's give it a go I think that's ready to go so broadcast so here's our new level looking good let's fall off the bottom and there we are flashes and resets flushes resets flushes recess great there we go we can die now excellent so the next thing to add in is detecting this stuff lava it stopped our project right all the lava we want to add a new custom block of game which we'll be testing whether we're dying so it's quite a new custom block called test die and I'll do it without run without screen refresh here we go test die and this is just gonna chest where they were touching red at the moment so I'll put a tiff in here and then touching color Oh nope wrong block touching color sorry and we will choose red okay for touching red and we can reuse the existing way of dying so set exit to die okay so if we're touching red we're going to die but where do we call this test form we probably want to call it now whenever we move the position of the player so here we are if we change the pair X change the X reposition and we should probably do it just in there so after we call position we'll also call test I we won't do it in these positions here because that's just getting us back to where we were if we've touched something we shouldn't like a platform we only want to do it as little as possible because touching color is a little bit expensive to call so let's just do it when we first move see if we can move a lot and then again we also want to call it in the change player Y script after that position so test died in there okay let's see if that works so let's go and find that lava there we go touches the lava and is no more all right that's it that's all I wanted to show for this tutorial and we'll add in perhaps some collectibles and things or maybe the new level feature next tutorial all right thank you for watching bye now
