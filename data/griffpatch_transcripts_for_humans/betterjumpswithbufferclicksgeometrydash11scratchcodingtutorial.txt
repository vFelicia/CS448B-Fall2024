00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - hello fellow scratchers your cries have
00:04 - not gone unnoticed and having made such
00:06 - great progress on our main geometry Das
00:08 - games we can finally start adding in all
00:10 - those extra highly anticipated features
00:12 - like jump pads jump orbs or rings as
00:15 - they officially named gravity portals
00:18 - and all those other game modes too are
00:20 - you ready for this oh yes so in today's
00:23 - episode we'll focus on the jump pads
00:26 - where simply making contact sends the
00:28 - player flying high into the air and jump
00:31 - Rings where the player has to trigger
00:33 - The Jump by clicking the jump button and
00:36 - yes for those in the know we will be
00:38 - supporting the more advanced buffer
00:40 - clicks so stay tuned to learn all about
00:43 - that later in the episode now if you
00:46 - appreciate a head start feel free to pop
00:48 - back into my scratch asset project the
00:50 - links under the video where you'll find
00:52 - these jump pads rings and a few new
00:55 - portals all ready to go just drop them
00:58 - into your backpack before before we
01:00 - begin right here we go open your
01:04 - projects from where we left off in
01:05 - episode 10 and before we make any
01:08 - changes save them as a brand new copy
01:10 - for this this is episode 11 guys let's
01:15 - get
01:17 - [Music]
01:18 - scratching I'm going to delete the old
01:21 - level asset Sprite to make way for the
01:23 - updated version from my backpack and
01:26 - very exciting they look too do remember
01:29 - if you you are drawing these yourself
01:31 - that each of these objects must have
01:33 - their own unique triggering color there
01:35 - no mean feet as we now have a multitude
01:38 - of yellow
01:39 - triggers okay we'll begin with the
01:42 - humble jump pad copy that to your
01:45 - clipboard and then move into the level
01:48 - Sprite testing is always easier if we
01:50 - add these to the start of our levels so
01:53 - duplicate the First costume level 11 one
01:56 - and paste a jump pad in there right at
01:59 - the bottom bottom if you're not using my
02:02 - assets though then this is a pretty easy
02:03 - shaped draw using the circle tool which
02:06 - you can then modify using the shaping
02:08 - tool use the ALT key to break a smooth
02:11 - curve and allow for this effect the fill
02:14 - Hue is 17 and the saturation and
02:17 - brightness are both full now don't
02:19 - forget the outline should never be
02:21 - bright white but instead a very light
02:23 - yellow now this is important so that
02:25 - when we make contact with the jump pad
02:28 - we don't get killed by it excellent we
02:30 - just clipped right through and it is
02:32 - looking great so all we want to do is
02:35 - trigger a large jump the moment it is
02:37 - touched and the size of the jump should
02:39 - be just over four blocks high so I'm
02:41 - going to bring in a stack of four blocks
02:43 - so that we can measure up when we test
02:45 - it yeah it has to be quite a bit more
02:47 - powerful than our standard jump
02:51 - height so make sure the level Sprite is
02:54 - visible on the stage so that we can see
02:56 - the color of that jump pad and then
02:58 - click into the player Sprite
03:00 - this is the easiest bit of coding we're
03:02 - going to have to put together scrolling
03:04 - down to the game on scripts and in our
03:07 - main game Loop we are already checking
03:10 - for touching portals however these pads
03:13 - want to trigger as soon as they are
03:15 - touched so we'll do that even before our
03:18 - player movement scripts make a new
03:21 - custom block naming it check
03:25 - Transporters and run without screen
03:27 - refresh all of these pads and jump rings
03:29 - are Transporters now as I said we'll run
03:32 - this before the player movement script
03:35 - up here and then bring that Define block
03:38 - down into some free
03:40 - space and this is so easy that I bet a
03:44 - lot of you literally jumped ahead and
03:46 - added these without me go on let me know
03:48 - in the comments if you did I've seen
03:49 - them in the studio if touching color and
03:53 - select that bright yellow pad the
03:55 - central color not the
03:58 - edge then then if we touch that pad we
04:02 - also jump so set speed y to
04:08 - 40.5 of course this value is subjective
04:11 - and will vary depending on your level
04:13 - and chosen block sizes so just play
04:15 - around with it to find the size of jump
04:17 - that you want in your game and that my
04:20 - friends is it I told you it was easy
04:23 - smash the green flag and here comes the
04:26 - pad oh yeah now that was a big jump
04:30 - right over the four blocks no problem I
04:34 - can see us having a lot of fun with that
04:35 - one and in Geometry Dash there are two
04:37 - other colors of jump pads that each have
04:40 - their own jump height so after this
04:42 - episode is done why not try and add
04:44 - those
04:45 - too yellow jump rings then now these are
04:49 - similar to jump pads except that they
04:52 - need to be manually triggered to make
04:54 - the player jump they look something like
04:56 - this and yeah the central color is a
04:59 - little bit darker than the other yellow
05:01 - pad to ensure that it's Unique I'll keep
05:03 - the two shapes grouped and let's copy it
05:06 - and we'll bring it into the level
05:08 - Sprite now you could make a new level
05:11 - costume or simply replace the previous
05:13 - one I'll place this jump ring just above
05:16 - the ground so I have to jump into it
05:18 - from below now what's important is that
05:21 - we again do not collide with the new
05:23 - shape when we touch it and also that we
05:26 - don't trigger the bigger jump due to the
05:28 - similar color
05:31 - now make sure to make the level Sprite
05:33 - visible on the stage again and then
05:35 - click into the player Sprite for
05:38 - starters it's a simple matter of
05:40 - duplicating the same touching color
05:42 - script and then we'll change the color
05:45 - for the new Jump Rings yellow you'll see
05:48 - the brightness of 98 these two yellows
05:50 - are hopefully different enough so the
05:53 - jump height of a jump ring is more or
05:55 - less the same as a regular jump so let's
05:58 - set speed y to
06:03 - 29 and the moment we touch the ring we
06:06 - are bounced off the top in a nice small
06:08 - jump
06:10 - cool but as I said earlier these jump
06:13 - rings are only supposed to be activated
06:15 - by the Press of the jump
06:18 - key however it's not quite that simple
06:22 - because as you know if you hold down the
06:24 - jump key in Geometry Dash the player
06:26 - will just keep on jumping well not so
06:30 - with a jump ring if the jump key has
06:32 - already triggered a previous jump then
06:35 - it will not trigger a jump ring oh no we
06:39 - pass straight through it a jump ring is
06:42 - only triggered if it is the first to be
06:45 - activated by that key press this is what
06:47 - is referred to as a buffered click so we
06:51 - are going to need to rethink our key
06:53 - handling on this one scroll up to find
06:57 - the Define Cube movement script
07:01 - this is one of the places we are
07:03 - detecting jump key presses and mouse
07:05 - clicks what I suggest we do is to take
07:08 - the combined checking logic and we'll
07:10 - drop it into the stage backdrop
07:14 - Sprite okay so here it is now we're
07:18 - going to code up a key press Loop when
07:21 - green flag clicked
07:24 - forever and then an if else block and
07:27 - drop in your jump detecting logic in the
07:30 - if now to alert all the other scripts
07:33 - that a jump has been requested we'll
07:35 - make a new variable jump key for all
07:39 - Sprites and yes I always name my for all
07:42 - Sprite variables in uppercase so that I
07:45 - can tell them apart did you notice that
07:48 - right begin right away by setting jump
07:51 - key to
07:52 - Zer then when the key is pressed we
07:55 - don't set but we change jump key by one
08:00 - that will let us know how long the key
08:02 - has been held down for very useful and
08:06 - finally in the El Branch when the jump
08:08 - key is released we set jump key back to
08:11 - zero once again we can test that easily
08:14 - enough and we can watch the jump key
08:16 - speed upwards whenever we click the
08:18 - mouse or press space the count will only
08:20 - increase by 30 a second once the game is
08:22 - running as it will be synced up with the
08:24 - game's frame rate so click back into the
08:27 - player Sprite and we'll replace place
08:29 - this key check within the cube movement
08:32 - script with a greater than checking if
08:35 - jump key is greater than
08:38 - zero and we do the same in the ship
08:41 - movement
08:42 - script replacing the key checks with our
08:45 - jump key
08:48 - check now it's a good idea to run the
08:50 - project here and just confirm that the
08:52 - game controls are still working as
08:55 - before looking good well then we can
08:59 - return turn back down to the defined
09:01 - check Transporters
09:03 - script and for starters we only want to
09:05 - check for jump rings when the player
09:07 - presses the jump key if jump key is
09:11 - greater
09:15 - than zero now we should be able to pass
09:20 - right through the jump ring as long as
09:21 - the key is not held
09:23 - down yeah but if we press the key then
09:27 - we still jump but if I hold down the
09:30 - jump key then sadly I still jump twice
09:34 - once on the floor and again on the jump
09:36 - ring and this is wrong the fix then is
09:39 - to bring in an and
09:41 - block and also require that the jump key
09:44 - is less
09:47 - [Music]
09:48 - than
09:51 - 100 now why does this help well it
09:54 - doesn't until we also change jump Key by
09:58 - 100 whenever we make a jump that will
10:01 - instantly prevent any further jump ring
10:04 - triggers until we let go of the jump key
10:07 - once more now of course we must then do
10:10 - the same for our normal jumps so find
10:12 - the cube movement script and when we
10:15 - jump we also change jump Key by
10:22 - 100 come on then let's give this a
10:25 - go long hold for the jump and and it
10:29 - doesn't trigger the jump ring
10:33 - good but a second
10:36 - press does trigger the ring and we get
10:39 - our desired second jump
10:43 - brilliant so before we finish I just
10:47 - wanted to say that my choice of where to
10:49 - add the Czech Transporters in our game
10:51 - on script may not actually be the best
10:55 - place having played around quite a bit I
10:57 - think it may actually be better to do
11:00 - this after the player movement scripts
11:03 - this makes collisions with the jump
11:04 - Rings just that little bit more robust
11:06 - and
11:09 - predictable so now that we have both
11:12 - jump pads and jump Rings implemented
11:14 - it's time to get creative and design
11:16 - some fantastic levels I simply cannot
11:19 - wait to see what you guys can create
11:21 - with this so don't forget to follow the
11:24 - link under the video and submit them to
11:26 - the official scratch Studio and yet
11:30 - there are still so many more things to
11:32 - come yes next episode we'll be adding
11:34 - the very exciting gravity portals
11:37 - flipping the gravity of both the cube
11:39 - and the ship modes upside down that is
11:43 - really going to shake things up how cool
11:45 - is
11:46 - that well I hope you've enjoyed watching
11:49 - this video if you did then please smash

12:06 - [Music]

in episode 10 and before we make any changes save them as a brand new copy for this this is episode 11 guys let's get scratching I'm going to delete the old level asset Sprite to make way for the
