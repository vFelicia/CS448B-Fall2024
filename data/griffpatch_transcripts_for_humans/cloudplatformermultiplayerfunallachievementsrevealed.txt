00:02 - [Music]
00:03 - ERS my scratch game Cloud platformer
00:06 - multiplayer fun is almost 10 years old
00:08 - but I'm still updating it to this very
00:11 - day and as such and to celebrate I'm
00:13 - going to give you a full game
00:14 - walkthrough of all 100 achievements yes
00:17 - that's right there sure is a lot to do
00:19 - in this fun social game shall we get
00:22 - started right off the bat just for
00:24 - jumping we get achievement one jump
00:27 - Crusade pull up a full list and you'll
00:29 - find there's a bunch of such
00:30 - achievements that will acquire simply by
00:32 - playing the game others require you to
00:34 - complete a number of challenging
00:35 - mini-games so stay tuned for those but
00:39 - right now by simply jumping off the
00:40 - bottom of the screen we'll pick up
00:41 - achievement 2 falling into the void
00:45 - achievement three ten jumps and after 10
00:47 - Falls number four never explore that a
00:51 - great start learning to wall jump is
00:54 - crucial to mastering this game there's
00:56 - achievement 5 wall jumping beginner and
00:59 - this is a route you'll travel a lot
01:01 - now stop there I made that little jump
01:03 - look easy didn't I but let me just do
01:06 - that again because you need to know how
01:08 - it's done
01:09 - we hold the up key and we do not let it
01:13 - go until the full maneuver is complete
01:16 - now while in the air move over to touch
01:18 - the wall and as long as you are still
01:20 - holding that jump key you will
01:22 - automatically begin a wall jump so now
01:25 - move yourself over to the right still
01:27 - holding that up key and our jump is
01:29 - complete it can take a bit of practice
01:31 - but you'll soon get it
01:33 - right this station below us is the mini
01:36 - station and we'll come back to that
01:37 - shortly but for now we're jumping nimbly
01:40 - across to the right to reach the jetpack
01:42 - station this helpful button can't be
01:44 - ignored though so stand on that to
01:46 - reveal a helpful bridge that other
01:48 - players can climb up achievement 6
01:50 - secret stairway and 10 seconds later the
01:54 - stairway helper achievement 2. now I
01:56 - said this game was so short just hit the
01:58 - t button for talk hi there and we've
02:01 - picked up the communication expert
02:03 - achievement now into the jetpack station
02:06 - we only get to use the Thruster power
02:08 - for 20 seconds before it will run out I
02:10 - want to complete the first Mini-Game
02:12 - though using this the Jetpack Joyride
02:14 - but there's a trick to making it easier
02:16 - and that is now to use the mini station
02:19 - to shrink us down we've earned the mini
02:22 - me station achievement and the mini
02:24 - jetpack achievement excellent and our
02:26 - power increases to 60 seconds however we
02:29 - do move a lot slower so more time is
02:31 - required now fly right over the jetpack
02:34 - station keeping low and you'll find the
02:36 - Jet Pack Joyride minigame here it is
02:39 - line yourself up with the starting arrow
02:41 - and and then the game takes over and we
02:44 - are off but being small this all happens
02:46 - a lot slower which gives us plenty of
02:49 - time to lay back and collect all the
02:51 - coins
02:53 - well that was no problem and what do we
02:56 - win the Jetpack Joyride mini game
02:58 - achievement a very fine red helmet and
03:01 - the blue ultra jet pack to boot with
03:04 - this new power I'll quickly Dash over
03:05 - and get the mini blue jetpack
03:08 - achievement variant and then if I don't
03:11 - get abducted by this other player we can
03:13 - fly directly up from the jetpack station
03:16 - to find oh okay lighters really wants to
03:19 - help thank you very much here is the
03:22 - giant station now because we went from
03:24 - very small to very large we gained the
03:27 - going through adolescence achievement
03:29 - now of course Giant Station achievement
03:32 - and the giant blue jet pack too wow next
03:36 - up we'll explore back to the left of the
03:38 - spawn area now this is the way to the
03:41 - pony station sometimes it can be
03:42 - required to discard your power to do
03:45 - this just tap the X key and we get the
03:48 - abdication achievement now for some
03:50 - Advanced wall jumping remember to hold
03:52 - the up key throughout do not let it go
03:55 - and then alternatively touch the left
03:57 - and right walls the pony station
04:00 - achievement and while it's on my mind
04:02 - grind that X key while standing in a
04:05 - station to discard your power over and
04:07 - over and then you'll get the naturalist
04:09 - achievement and the authentic Broly
04:12 - achievement 2.
04:13 - now Pony can't wall jump so getting them
04:17 - to the mini station can be a little
04:18 - tricky at first just make sure you don't
04:20 - fall down to the ground otherwise you'll
04:22 - have to start all over again and reclaim
04:24 - the mini Pony so cool don't ask me why
04:27 - gravity Works slower when you are
04:29 - smaller it's a thing now there's another
04:31 - station at our fingertips and that is
04:34 - the nion cat station oh nice we also
04:37 - picked up the hundred jumps
04:41 - and then we do some clever ledge jumping
04:43 - hops to get up to the top here
04:46 - Nyan Cat station
04:48 - [Music]
04:49 - and this is awesome it's easily the
04:51 - fastest flying power that you can get
04:53 - and do you know what nyan cat likes to
04:55 - say talk and under number three epic
04:57 - category we can say Nyan Nyan Nyan and
05:01 - that unlocks authentic Nyan Cat
05:03 - achievement number 25 let's fly directly
05:06 - right from the nine o'clock station to
05:08 - find the Giant Station lion bar
05:11 - achievement I'm so big and so fast see
05:15 - if I can get this into the mini station
05:16 - too yep we fit mini Nyan Cat
05:20 - well since we are so small this is a
05:23 - great opportunity to visit the UFO
05:25 - station and you can see it's located in
05:27 - a cave to the left of the main playing
05:30 - area that's locked from the inside
05:32 - except if you are small enough to
05:34 - squeeze in through this little tunnel
05:36 - where we happen to pick up the tunnel
05:37 - crawler achievement and if we hang on in
05:40 - here just a second natural ferret 2
05:43 - super
05:44 - and here is the UFO station this is
05:48 - especially fun because pressing space
05:49 - lets you pick up other players indeed
05:52 - there are a number of achievements that
05:53 - you cannot get without someone else's
05:55 - help this button here will let us out
05:57 - secret passage achievement and also let
06:00 - others if it pays to be helpful stay
06:03 - here long enough and you'll also get the
06:05 - passageway helper achievement too
06:07 - so I think it's time for a bit more of a
06:10 - challenge the pony cat chew achievement
06:13 - then first become the pony and then make
06:16 - our way directly to the Nyan Cat station
06:18 - made Difficult by the lack of wall
06:20 - jumping make sure you are high enough to
06:22 - make this ledge always jumping from as
06:24 - high up as you can be and holding the
06:26 - jump key as long as you can for full
06:29 - jump height yay Pony kachu is ours and
06:33 - look at this a wild Pokeball has
06:35 - appeared to tempt us into one of the
06:37 - harder mini games except I'm not going
06:39 - to pass up this opportunity for a lift
06:41 - to the Giant Station will you help me
06:43 - lighters yes yes you will so awesome
06:47 - this is one of those achievements that
06:49 - you just can't do alone so the easiest
06:52 - route to remember is to fly directly
06:54 - right from the Nyan Cat station
06:57 - here we are
06:59 - and um holy moly as it turns out there
07:02 - is no achievement for this well I expect
07:05 - there will be very shortly if I remember
07:07 - to add it I guess I can just enjoy the
07:09 - satisfaction of being a large Pikachu
07:11 - for the time being the achievement we
07:14 - really needed help with was the giant
07:16 - Pony
07:17 - oh nice wall jumping expert
07:21 - now is anybody willing to help me with
07:23 - this Pony to the Giant Station
07:25 - well I guess not right now oh well back
07:29 - to that awesome Pikachu minigame and you
07:32 - ready for this as soon as we click the
07:35 - first Pokeball the game begins so we
07:39 - have 180 balls to collect and only 200
07:41 - seconds to complete the Run what's more
07:43 - the level becomes a more dangerous place
07:45 - filled with spikes and careful that
07:47 - fireball almost singed my tail
07:49 - now I really don't like this jump here
07:52 - sometimes I don't quite make it and I
07:54 - fall down losing valuable time and
07:57 - you'll notice the balls are only
07:58 - appearing a few moves ahead so you have
08:00 - to follow the prescribed routes
08:05 - okay now careful here not to enter the
08:07 - power up station that would abruptly end
08:10 - the minigame and that can be so annoying
08:12 - believe me
08:14 - okay the fireball's back I can gain Time
08:16 - by beating it over the spikes
08:19 - weaving down the clip collecting balls
08:22 - as we go and I don't want to miss this
08:24 - all on our way down and lose time
08:27 - okay this is a particularly tricky
08:29 - maneuver oh no I missed the wall jump
08:32 - and wow that was so close to hitting
08:34 - those spikes quickly now I need to get
08:36 - back on track I still might be okay as
08:38 - I'm doing great time-wise so far
08:41 - and I always think of this as the home
08:43 - straight but don't get too relaxed
08:45 - there's plenty of fireballs to catch us
08:47 - off guard
08:47 - [Music]
08:50 - big jumps to clear the spikes
08:53 - but a huge jump into the unknown well
08:56 - unless you know the level and then you'd
08:58 - know we are heading for the jetpack
08:59 - station area neutral jumps
09:02 - and then watch out for more fireballs
09:05 - because this is it now we are at the end
09:07 - so just patiently follow these last ones
09:10 - and we've done it Pikachu speedrun
09:14 - completed that's worth a small
09:16 - celebration don't you think for
09:18 - completing a mini game we earned the
09:20 - rainbow status and also if I remove my
09:22 - power you'll see we have also earned a
09:24 - very fine minigame themed hat and that
09:27 - we can now switch to at any time to show
09:30 - it off to other players fun right okay
09:33 - what shall we do next I say we go for
09:36 - some gravity big achievements there's a
09:38 - whole bunch we can get in a row with
09:39 - that we need to scale the left-hand
09:41 - Cliff this is the hardest part as you
09:43 - need to perform a few single wall jumps
09:46 - just remember to keep holding that up
09:48 - key the entire type and here we are the
09:51 - gravity Pig station achievement this pig
09:54 - has some serious power just pressed
09:56 - space and you'll find out what it is
09:57 - yeah gravity flips and we've earned the
10:01 - gravity cheetah achievement another nine
10:04 - of such flips and we'll get the gravity
10:06 - mad achievement too oh guys while we're
10:09 - up here at the top of the level I gotta
10:11 - show you achievement 39 V butterfly
10:14 - station and this is the start of yet
10:17 - another mini game drop down and you'll
10:19 - find there are 15 flowers distributed
10:21 - around the level that you need to visit
10:23 - in under 130 seconds
10:26 - but man is it hard to find them all in
10:29 - that time so let's come back to that one
10:31 - later I want to show off more gravity
10:33 - Pig here we go as soon as we become the
10:36 - pig we run as fast as our Wee Little
10:38 - eggs in cavius and we are heading for
10:40 - the mini me station and we've only got
10:43 - 60 seconds to get there and don't fall
10:45 - down any holes or into space the first
10:47 - major trick is this jump to get across
10:49 - to the mini station flip and now we have
10:52 - another 60 seconds to get mini gravity
10:55 - Pig back to the UFO station within the
10:58 - clip toggle gravity at the last moment
11:00 - oh and look at this another UFO pig is
11:03 - trying to lend a hand well why not when
11:07 - you don't have a helpful UFO to help you
11:09 - you'll need to walk at full speed and
11:11 - carefully flip gravity to get across all
11:13 - the larger gaps
11:16 - and here we go 41 a pig of a squeeze
11:21 - through the tunnel and into the UFO
11:23 - station and this is a special transition
11:26 - the mini pig is able to enter the UFO so
11:29 - we earn the UF Pig achievement or the
11:33 - unidentified flying pig
11:35 - so fun but what's extra exciting about
11:38 - this UFO is that if we visit the mini me
11:41 - station we can shrink down our already
11:44 - mini pig into a super tiny pig in a mini
11:47 - UFO bear with me then fly up up to the
11:52 - Giant Station and this is where it gets
11:54 - funky before going in press the X to
11:57 - give up the UFO power and behold the
12:00 - pink spec achievement because we are
12:03 - extra tiny and then Dash right for the
12:06 - water porker achievement too epic
12:10 - right so there's a hidden power-up
12:13 - station in the little cave under the
12:15 - jetpack station we just wait for five
12:17 - seconds and
12:20 - you have earned the toad in the whole
12:22 - achievement this one is really fun the
12:25 - movement is quite different from the
12:27 - previous characters as we have to point
12:28 - in the direction to hop and then hold
12:30 - down the space key to power up and
12:33 - release to jump there are a few special
12:36 - achievements to gain from this little
12:37 - fellow the first involves navigating
12:39 - them across the level and up the click
12:42 - but to do this I'd advise going by the
12:45 - pony station route
12:48 - if you get it just right we'll end up
12:51 - being able to then jump again up and
12:53 - over the gravity big station at the top
12:55 - of the cliff
12:57 - and hop down to the water's edge and
13:00 - here it's one long jump
13:01 - [Music]
13:03 - for a lucky landing on this beautiful
13:06 - Lee pad of ours rainbow frog achieved
13:10 - now a more difficult task is getting our
13:12 - towed up to the Giant Station and it
13:15 - involves jumping carefully up to the top
13:18 - large platform here and sadly unlike
13:21 - most characters the Frog and snail
13:23 - cannot be picked up by The Helpful UFO
13:25 - players so getting them to the giant
13:26 - station has to be done solo I'm afraid
13:30 - and the next two platforms are oh man
13:32 - tiny and all too easy to misjudge let's
13:35 - try that again stand in the middle and
13:38 - angle just a tiny bit off vertical and
13:40 - then full power
13:42 - yes got it and now we have to pull it
13:45 - off again but this time with a little
13:47 - less power so as not to overshoot nice
13:50 - this last jump is not so far
13:53 - and we claim the Mega Toad achievement
13:56 - however there's little time to wait
13:58 - around as we've only got 45 seconds to
14:01 - pull off the next trick getting over to
14:03 - that Lily Pad again oh yeah and that
14:06 - jump was a cracker really fortunate not
14:08 - put ended up down the bottom of the
14:09 - cliff and a leap across the lily pad
14:13 - oh nearly a quick correction
14:16 - and we're home Mega rainbow blog what oh
14:22 - dear I think that's a typo I really
14:24 - should get that fixed nice thing about
14:27 - these rainbow characters is that you get
14:29 - a long time to show them off so I'm
14:31 - going back to the spawn to strut my
14:33 - stuff oh hello to T-Rex oh they like to
14:36 - snack on other players yeah and there
14:39 - goes my mega Vlog but happily there's
14:42 - even an achievement for being eaten Dino
14:44 - fodder
14:46 - the cool thing about being a pair of
14:47 - floating eyes is that we can get to
14:50 - almost every Power Up station using them
14:52 - but let's make the most of things and
14:54 - head to the Giant Station to pick up the
14:56 - achievement Grand overseer
14:59 - hey you know what I haven't done yet I
15:02 - haven't respawned smash the r key for
15:05 - that and earn the respawner achievement
15:08 - keep spamming the r key and you'll get
15:10 - the respawner pro as well
15:12 - oh no another T-Rex oh there's the 500
15:15 - jumps achievement and I'm Dino fodder
15:18 - again ha well let's sail upwards right
15:21 - up to the top of the level and jump into
15:23 - achievement falling into space we need
15:27 - to do that a few more times to pick up
15:29 - another achievement but I'm really keen
15:31 - on showing you the fish station because
15:33 - that's one of my favorites it's up the
15:35 - cliff and down in the water so there's a
15:39 - few routes to get deep quick either jump
15:41 - from the lily pad or bounce your way
15:43 - down the shoreline like this just make
15:45 - sure you are traveling fast as you enter
15:47 - the water we hold down on the sea floor
15:50 - and then jump up to power quickly to get
15:53 - the fish station achievement oh man I
15:56 - love being a fish oh no though this
15:58 - fellow scratcher did not enter the water
16:00 - fast enough and is unlikely to have
16:02 - enough air to get safety to the fish
16:03 - station well maybe I can teach them the
16:06 - easier Lily Pad root come with me look
16:08 - do as I do jump okay
16:11 - see how quickly we sink to the bottom
16:13 - that way
16:14 - oh no don't get stuck on the wall no
16:17 - good they're going to make it and and
16:19 - jump
16:21 - yeah
16:22 - [Music]
16:23 - what follow you no no sorry I'm on a
16:27 - mission now for the fishcoin Run mini
16:29 - game collect the first coin and we are
16:32 - off 100 coins to go
16:34 - it's a nice pleasant course to this one
16:36 - not too difficult and you have lots of
16:38 - time I recently upgraded the water area
16:41 - to remove the ugly seams where the
16:43 - scrolling scene costumes overlapped and
16:45 - they're added in the Rippling on the
16:46 - surface and included those attractive
16:48 - bubbles for effect I think it looks
16:50 - pretty sweet
16:52 - and we did it complete the fishcoin Run
16:55 - achievement and look at our view Ward
16:58 - the blue flying fish with oh so much
17:01 - time to enjoy it
17:02 - with this guy once you get out of the
17:04 - water you can hold up and fly high into
17:06 - the sky but watch out because as soon as
17:09 - you release the up key you begin to fall
17:11 - and you cannot fly up again until you
17:13 - reach the floor it's so easy to
17:16 - accidentally fall down a hole and lose
17:18 - your power
17:19 - what I'm heading for is the giant
17:22 - station and we can pick up the it was
17:25 - this big achievement as always this
17:28 - doesn't last long so get yourself down
17:30 - to the mini station for its Twin power
17:32 - shrimp
17:34 - now careful as you fly we have 60
17:36 - seconds to find our way back to the
17:38 - water and it's not super easy with the
17:41 - weird flying control scheme of this
17:43 - little fellow almost there
17:46 - yes the Curious Case of Benjamin salmon
17:49 - shout out in the comments if you know
17:52 - why this achievement is called that okay
17:54 - so since we are in the water let's swim
17:57 - to this interesting looking area to the
17:59 - far left of the level so although I got
18:02 - here as a fish you can also get here by
18:04 - performing some fast underwater jumping
18:06 - techniques too I'm going to discard the
18:08 - flying fish so that I can get the
18:10 - achievement for this tricky climb you
18:13 - really have to perfect wall jumping and
18:15 - the Art of jumping from the highest
18:16 - point holding down the jump key for as
18:18 - long as possible to get the full jump
18:20 - height and also not jumping too early in
18:24 - fact you can almost run off a ledge
18:26 - before you jump to get the furthest jump
18:28 - possible and in this climb you really
18:30 - need every bit of distance you can
18:32 - muster
18:33 - and here we are ultimate solo aquaclim
18:36 - achieved it was worth the effort and
18:40 - here we are ready to jump into the
18:41 - awesome Flappy Bird station you can just
18:44 - sit on the button a little longer and
18:45 - tell everybody that the Flappy Bird
18:47 - station is open for business
18:48 - oh no I hit the r key what no can you
18:53 - believe it oh great I respawned I'll
18:56 - have to go back oh fine thank you very
18:59 - much where are you taking me to oh nice
19:02 - well since we are back at the butterfly
19:03 - Station high up above the gravity pig
19:05 - let me show you another fun achievement
19:07 - that is to be had flap your way down to
19:11 - the mini station
19:12 - and tell me what is a small butterfly
19:16 - yeah it's The Hungry Caterpillar of
19:19 - course just fulfilling one of my
19:21 - childhood dreams right here don't all
19:23 - these Foods look yummy hmm trick is can
19:27 - we find all 15 in only 240 seconds
19:31 - one treat that a lot of people Miss is
19:33 - the one through the Gap in this clip and
19:36 - we can easily squeeze through in this
19:38 - cute body shape yeah and there's another
19:41 - down by the water
19:42 - just eight to go one over the pony
19:46 - station
19:47 - and three more up towards the Nyan Cat
19:50 - station
19:52 - but luckily not on the very top that
19:55 - would have been
19:57 - there we have one above the mini station
19:59 - just three to go come on another above
20:02 - the UFO platforms huge jump now yeah
20:05 - just two to go
20:07 - oh so this one is the last one
20:11 - amazing we have completed the Hungry
20:13 - Caterpillar challenge so cool and we'll
20:17 - have earned a very stylish hat for that
20:19 - you can be sure oh wow luck is surely on
20:22 - my side as it looks like this helpful
20:24 - UFO player is giving us a free ride up
20:26 - to the Giant Station thank you mate we
20:29 - have the supersized caterpillar
20:31 - achievement
20:34 - but what should we do next okay uh
20:37 - flying under the bridge we just need any
20:40 - flying power for this one nion cat will
20:42 - do or the UFO and then we fly down under
20:44 - the little Bridge directly below the
20:46 - mini station careful not to go down too
20:48 - low and we earn the fly under the bridge
20:51 - achievement also if we hover around in
20:53 - here for 10 seconds we also pick up the
20:56 - waiting for Three Billy Goats award two
20:59 - and the fun doesn't stop there since we
21:01 - have this new station at fingertips pop
21:03 - in there for the snail station power up
21:07 - this Avatar is indeed very fun but
21:10 - you'll have to work on telling your left
21:11 - from your ride as you begin to travel
21:13 - upside down also there's a new mini game
21:15 - to be played so press up to reach out
21:18 - for the treats above you and also hold
21:20 - space to reach out in front of you too
21:22 - now if you've played many of my scratch
21:24 - games then you may recognize this idea
21:27 - comes from my pen game called Snail
21:29 - so although we can't jump we can reach
21:32 - out with our head and pull ourselves
21:33 - across gaps and up to platforms that we
21:35 - otherwise could not have reached this
21:38 - course is a bit of a puzzle but just let
21:40 - the purple snail treats lead them way
21:42 - there's certainly a lot of interesting
21:43 - shapes to be navigated around
21:45 - and at some points you may find you just
21:47 - need to fall and that's no problem we
21:49 - just hold the down key to release our
21:51 - grip and as everyone knows a snail
21:53 - always lands on their feet
21:55 - and off we go again
21:59 - almost there now
22:01 - [Music]
22:04 - and done snail treat minigame achieved
22:09 - and we have the rainbow snail and of
22:11 - course another beautiful Mini-Game hat
22:13 - to show off do that rainbow snail dance
22:16 - I love that one
22:18 - where's the Flappy Bird station well
22:21 - follow me my friend
22:23 - watch how we get to the Flappy Bird
22:25 - station without a fish power up now use
22:27 - your jump momentum to power down through
22:29 - the water
22:30 - and then jump off the bottom to
22:32 - carefully navigate without getting
22:33 - snagged to the solo climb area
22:37 - gosh I hope they make it oh sad they
22:40 - didn't maybe they'll get to watch this
22:42 - video but at least permafron is already
22:46 - here at the top cool right then let's do
22:49 - this Flappy Bird station and I'm not
22:54 - going to lie everybody knows Flappy Bird
22:56 - is hard so this Flappy Bird minigame is
22:58 - really tough for beginners touching the
23:01 - floor or the ceiling is an instant game
23:03 - over unlike traditional Flappy Bird
23:05 - though we can change direction which
23:07 - does make this a little interesting
23:09 - don't touch the water though over the
23:11 - gravity Pig station we go and then head
23:13 - down the cliff
23:16 - and back up
23:17 - [Music]
23:19 - the pony station okay our first small
23:21 - Gap up is easier than down so you just
23:24 - wait plunge down carefully
23:27 - and this one is so close to the surface
23:29 - oh no I touched the ground one mistake
23:33 - and it's all over at least we get reset
23:36 - back to the start of the Flappy Bird
23:38 - game so that we can play it again and
23:40 - again
23:41 - right then here we go
23:52 - drop down through the Gap and quickly
23:54 - back up
23:56 - a small pause before U-turn and now
23:58 - we're in the thick of it careful not to
24:00 - touch the floor or ceiling
24:01 - [Music]
24:03 - oh no I missed that one hold on careful
24:06 - does it this one's Mega tight yes and
24:10 - then come on this is it
24:12 - that was crazy nice one achievement 69
24:17 - completed the floppy coin run how about
24:21 - that we have the Rainbow Man and they're
24:24 - wearing a most Splendid Flappy Bird hat
24:27 - too so Chic what's not to love and still
24:31 - 30 more achievements to go wow hey
24:34 - remember that snail get them in the
24:37 - water or the pond snail achievement
24:39 - and then help out some friends at the
24:42 - Flappy Bird station by standing on that
24:43 - button The Climb helper
24:46 - then off we fly once more but this time
24:49 - forget those coins we're heading
24:51 - directly right across the entire level
24:53 - we want the Giant Station and it's
24:55 - always directly to the right of the Nyan
24:57 - Cat station here of course
25:00 - here it is now we have to be careful ah
25:03 - yes we are in for the reverse Evolution
25:06 - Rex achievement of course and no time to
25:09 - lose let's put these Jaws to good use
25:11 - and snack on some players spam that
25:14 - space key to get chomping this chap
25:16 - looks tasty yum thank you man that's the
25:19 - big eat achievement in the bag
25:22 - I just want to get this Dino into the
25:24 - mini station but we can't jump that high
25:26 - so we must go the long way around and
25:29 - getting your footing is a little tricky
25:31 - oops over 60 seconds to go though we'll
25:33 - make it
25:35 - yes there we go and we're in mini Rex
25:38 - achievement 74. what a cute dinosaur
25:41 - this is a good chance to show off all
25:44 - our hard work by comparing our hats look
25:47 - at all these Beauties I see these guys
25:49 - have all completed the Flappy Bird
25:50 - challenge too nice job guys talking of
25:54 - hats there's another we haven't yet
25:56 - earned but for that we need to go back
25:58 - to the Flappy Bird station once more
26:02 - and this time head or the mini station
26:06 - now we can come in from either the left
26:10 - or the right but it but it's really
26:11 - quite hard to get it first time however
26:14 - I'm feeling lucky yes we have the you
26:18 - chicken achievement I made it look easy
26:20 - and it's really not hey and also look at
26:23 - that we gained the mini flap achievement
26:25 - too there's a fun mini game attached to
26:27 - this little chap just above the station
26:29 - has appeared a collectible pile of red
26:31 - bird seeds yet another reference to a
26:34 - famous retro arcade game which some of
26:36 - you might recognize do tell me if you
26:38 - know now in this mini game there are
26:39 - many seeds to be collected and they
26:41 - don't appear in a forced order therefore
26:44 - we have to find our own fastest path
26:45 - around the level luckily this chick is
26:48 - no slouch so who recognizes this little
26:51 - bird shout out in the comments if you
26:53 - know where you've seen him before
26:55 - hello fellow Flappy oh odia

27:04 - miss that platform I'm going to pay for
27:06 - that I really hope I can complete this
27:08 - still okay don't give up run little
27:11 - chick run like you've never run before
27:14 - and I'm going to have to double back
27:16 - here to get that missed seed from the
27:18 - top platform then for maximum effort
27:20 - Geronimo
27:22 - easy and the seeds are mine but gosh
27:25 - only four five seconds remain on the
27:27 - clock to find 29 more seeds I'm not sure
27:30 - if I'm gonna make this in time
27:32 - taking the low road then up and down oh
27:35 - no missed that oh come on and down 30
27:38 - seconds and still 26 seeds this is going
27:41 - to be tight
27:43 - oh and I'm not getting these jumps spot
27:45 - on and we've got to be perfect now to
27:47 - have a chance of beating this run I'm
27:49 - really conscious that we still have the
27:51 - water area to get across and it's so
27:52 - easy to slow down there
27:54 - jump and down oh cool like a duck to
27:58 - water up onto the lily
28:01 - [Music]
28:02 - six seconds and we need to get this wall
28:04 - jump first time please oh no oh no yes

28:34 - platformer fun Pro if you can show off
28:37 - this hat oh are we going for a ride I
28:40 - hope we're off to the Giant Station yes

29:22 - we go or the mothership achievement now
29:27 - I don't yet have that giant Pony but
29:30 - nobody's around to carry me up ah so
29:34 - change of plan Pony over to the jetpack
29:36 - station or however you want to get here
29:38 - and simply fly directly up to snag the
29:41 - giant jetpack achievement that usually
29:45 - is one of the first on my list to do
29:47 - check my list
29:48 - gravity expert that's simple enough get
29:51 - the gravity Pig and mash the space key
29:53 - to flip up and down and that's it
29:55 - gravity expert hey I don't know how many
29:59 - people have worked out this next one
30:01 - it's the vertically confused snail you
30:04 - need to find your way to the snail
30:06 - station but enter it upside down as the
30:09 - gravity Pig Yeah vertically confused
30:13 - snail now what makes this snail weird is
30:16 - that when you press down instead of
30:18 - falling downwards you now fall upwards
30:20 - instead and that's why you get this
30:22 - vertical Avo as a guide to let you know
30:24 - the direction of gravity so watch this
30:27 - pressing down and up we go so fun
30:30 - although I think I may regret falling
30:33 - upwards quite so soon the only way is up
30:35 - baby for you and me now so oh well at
30:38 - least we got another achievement
30:40 - space snail and I'm back for more this
30:44 - time I'll get as far right of the level

Cleaned transcript:

foreign ERS my scratch game Cloud platformer multiplayer fun is almost 10 years old but I'm still updating it to this very day and as such and to celebrate I'm going to give you a full game walkthrough of all 100 achievements yes that's right there sure is a lot to do in this fun social game shall we get started right off the bat just for jumping we get achievement one jump Crusade pull up a full list and you'll find there's a bunch of such achievements that will acquire simply by playing the game others require you to complete a number of challenging minigames so stay tuned for those but right now by simply jumping off the bottom of the screen we'll pick up achievement 2 falling into the void achievement three ten jumps and after 10 Falls number four never explore that a great start learning to wall jump is crucial to mastering this game there's achievement 5 wall jumping beginner and this is a route you'll travel a lot now stop there I made that little jump look easy didn't I but let me just do that again because you need to know how it's done we hold the up key and we do not let it go until the full maneuver is complete now while in the air move over to touch the wall and as long as you are still holding that jump key you will automatically begin a wall jump so now move yourself over to the right still holding that up key and our jump is complete it can take a bit of practice but you'll soon get it right this station below us is the mini station and we'll come back to that shortly but for now we're jumping nimbly across to the right to reach the jetpack station this helpful button can't be ignored though so stand on that to reveal a helpful bridge that other players can climb up achievement 6 secret stairway and 10 seconds later the stairway helper achievement 2. now I said this game was so short just hit the t button for talk hi there and we've picked up the communication expert achievement now into the jetpack station we only get to use the Thruster power for 20 seconds before it will run out I want to complete the first MiniGame though using this the Jetpack Joyride but there's a trick to making it easier and that is now to use the mini station to shrink us down we've earned the mini me station achievement and the mini jetpack achievement excellent and our power increases to 60 seconds however we do move a lot slower so more time is required now fly right over the jetpack station keeping low and you'll find the Jet Pack Joyride minigame here it is line yourself up with the starting arrow and and then the game takes over and we are off but being small this all happens a lot slower which gives us plenty of time to lay back and collect all the coins well that was no problem and what do we win the Jetpack Joyride mini game achievement a very fine red helmet and the blue ultra jet pack to boot with this new power I'll quickly Dash over and get the mini blue jetpack achievement variant and then if I don't get abducted by this other player we can fly directly up from the jetpack station to find oh okay lighters really wants to help thank you very much here is the giant station now because we went from very small to very large we gained the going through adolescence achievement now of course Giant Station achievement and the giant blue jet pack too wow next up we'll explore back to the left of the spawn area now this is the way to the pony station sometimes it can be required to discard your power to do this just tap the X key and we get the abdication achievement now for some Advanced wall jumping remember to hold the up key throughout do not let it go and then alternatively touch the left and right walls the pony station achievement and while it's on my mind grind that X key while standing in a station to discard your power over and over and then you'll get the naturalist achievement and the authentic Broly achievement 2. now Pony can't wall jump so getting them to the mini station can be a little tricky at first just make sure you don't fall down to the ground otherwise you'll have to start all over again and reclaim the mini Pony so cool don't ask me why gravity Works slower when you are smaller it's a thing now there's another station at our fingertips and that is the nion cat station oh nice we also picked up the hundred jumps and then we do some clever ledge jumping hops to get up to the top here Nyan Cat station and this is awesome it's easily the fastest flying power that you can get and do you know what nyan cat likes to say talk and under number three epic category we can say Nyan Nyan Nyan and that unlocks authentic Nyan Cat achievement number 25 let's fly directly right from the nine o'clock station to find the Giant Station lion bar achievement I'm so big and so fast see if I can get this into the mini station too yep we fit mini Nyan Cat well since we are so small this is a great opportunity to visit the UFO station and you can see it's located in a cave to the left of the main playing area that's locked from the inside except if you are small enough to squeeze in through this little tunnel where we happen to pick up the tunnel crawler achievement and if we hang on in here just a second natural ferret 2 super and here is the UFO station this is especially fun because pressing space lets you pick up other players indeed there are a number of achievements that you cannot get without someone else's help this button here will let us out secret passage achievement and also let others if it pays to be helpful stay here long enough and you'll also get the passageway helper achievement too so I think it's time for a bit more of a challenge the pony cat chew achievement then first become the pony and then make our way directly to the Nyan Cat station made Difficult by the lack of wall jumping make sure you are high enough to make this ledge always jumping from as high up as you can be and holding the jump key as long as you can for full jump height yay Pony kachu is ours and look at this a wild Pokeball has appeared to tempt us into one of the harder mini games except I'm not going to pass up this opportunity for a lift to the Giant Station will you help me lighters yes yes you will so awesome this is one of those achievements that you just can't do alone so the easiest route to remember is to fly directly right from the Nyan Cat station here we are and um holy moly as it turns out there is no achievement for this well I expect there will be very shortly if I remember to add it I guess I can just enjoy the satisfaction of being a large Pikachu for the time being the achievement we really needed help with was the giant Pony oh nice wall jumping expert now is anybody willing to help me with this Pony to the Giant Station well I guess not right now oh well back to that awesome Pikachu minigame and you ready for this as soon as we click the first Pokeball the game begins so we have 180 balls to collect and only 200 seconds to complete the Run what's more the level becomes a more dangerous place filled with spikes and careful that fireball almost singed my tail now I really don't like this jump here sometimes I don't quite make it and I fall down losing valuable time and you'll notice the balls are only appearing a few moves ahead so you have to follow the prescribed routes okay now careful here not to enter the power up station that would abruptly end the minigame and that can be so annoying believe me okay the fireball's back I can gain Time by beating it over the spikes weaving down the clip collecting balls as we go and I don't want to miss this all on our way down and lose time okay this is a particularly tricky maneuver oh no I missed the wall jump and wow that was so close to hitting those spikes quickly now I need to get back on track I still might be okay as I'm doing great timewise so far and I always think of this as the home straight but don't get too relaxed there's plenty of fireballs to catch us off guard big jumps to clear the spikes but a huge jump into the unknown well unless you know the level and then you'd know we are heading for the jetpack station area neutral jumps and then watch out for more fireballs because this is it now we are at the end so just patiently follow these last ones and we've done it Pikachu speedrun completed that's worth a small celebration don't you think for completing a mini game we earned the rainbow status and also if I remove my power you'll see we have also earned a very fine minigame themed hat and that we can now switch to at any time to show it off to other players fun right okay what shall we do next I say we go for some gravity big achievements there's a whole bunch we can get in a row with that we need to scale the lefthand Cliff this is the hardest part as you need to perform a few single wall jumps just remember to keep holding that up key the entire type and here we are the gravity Pig station achievement this pig has some serious power just pressed space and you'll find out what it is yeah gravity flips and we've earned the gravity cheetah achievement another nine of such flips and we'll get the gravity mad achievement too oh guys while we're up here at the top of the level I gotta show you achievement 39 V butterfly station and this is the start of yet another mini game drop down and you'll find there are 15 flowers distributed around the level that you need to visit in under 130 seconds but man is it hard to find them all in that time so let's come back to that one later I want to show off more gravity Pig here we go as soon as we become the pig we run as fast as our Wee Little eggs in cavius and we are heading for the mini me station and we've only got 60 seconds to get there and don't fall down any holes or into space the first major trick is this jump to get across to the mini station flip and now we have another 60 seconds to get mini gravity Pig back to the UFO station within the clip toggle gravity at the last moment oh and look at this another UFO pig is trying to lend a hand well why not when you don't have a helpful UFO to help you you'll need to walk at full speed and carefully flip gravity to get across all the larger gaps and here we go 41 a pig of a squeeze through the tunnel and into the UFO station and this is a special transition the mini pig is able to enter the UFO so we earn the UF Pig achievement or the unidentified flying pig so fun but what's extra exciting about this UFO is that if we visit the mini me station we can shrink down our already mini pig into a super tiny pig in a mini UFO bear with me then fly up up to the Giant Station and this is where it gets funky before going in press the X to give up the UFO power and behold the pink spec achievement because we are extra tiny and then Dash right for the water porker achievement too epic right so there's a hidden powerup station in the little cave under the jetpack station we just wait for five seconds and you have earned the toad in the whole achievement this one is really fun the movement is quite different from the previous characters as we have to point in the direction to hop and then hold down the space key to power up and release to jump there are a few special achievements to gain from this little fellow the first involves navigating them across the level and up the click but to do this I'd advise going by the pony station route if you get it just right we'll end up being able to then jump again up and over the gravity big station at the top of the cliff and hop down to the water's edge and here it's one long jump for a lucky landing on this beautiful Lee pad of ours rainbow frog achieved now a more difficult task is getting our towed up to the Giant Station and it involves jumping carefully up to the top large platform here and sadly unlike most characters the Frog and snail cannot be picked up by The Helpful UFO players so getting them to the giant station has to be done solo I'm afraid and the next two platforms are oh man tiny and all too easy to misjudge let's try that again stand in the middle and angle just a tiny bit off vertical and then full power yes got it and now we have to pull it off again but this time with a little less power so as not to overshoot nice this last jump is not so far and we claim the Mega Toad achievement however there's little time to wait around as we've only got 45 seconds to pull off the next trick getting over to that Lily Pad again oh yeah and that jump was a cracker really fortunate not put ended up down the bottom of the cliff and a leap across the lily pad oh nearly a quick correction and we're home Mega rainbow blog what oh dear I think that's a typo I really should get that fixed nice thing about these rainbow characters is that you get a long time to show them off so I'm going back to the spawn to strut my stuff oh hello to TRex oh they like to snack on other players yeah and there goes my mega Vlog but happily there's even an achievement for being eaten Dino fodder the cool thing about being a pair of floating eyes is that we can get to almost every Power Up station using them but let's make the most of things and head to the Giant Station to pick up the achievement Grand overseer hey you know what I haven't done yet I haven't respawned smash the r key for that and earn the respawner achievement keep spamming the r key and you'll get the respawner pro as well oh no another TRex oh there's the 500 jumps achievement and I'm Dino fodder again ha well let's sail upwards right up to the top of the level and jump into achievement falling into space we need to do that a few more times to pick up another achievement but I'm really keen on showing you the fish station because that's one of my favorites it's up the cliff and down in the water so there's a few routes to get deep quick either jump from the lily pad or bounce your way down the shoreline like this just make sure you are traveling fast as you enter the water we hold down on the sea floor and then jump up to power quickly to get the fish station achievement oh man I love being a fish oh no though this fellow scratcher did not enter the water fast enough and is unlikely to have enough air to get safety to the fish station well maybe I can teach them the easier Lily Pad root come with me look do as I do jump okay see how quickly we sink to the bottom that way oh no don't get stuck on the wall no good they're going to make it and and jump yeah what follow you no no sorry I'm on a mission now for the fishcoin Run mini game collect the first coin and we are off 100 coins to go it's a nice pleasant course to this one not too difficult and you have lots of time I recently upgraded the water area to remove the ugly seams where the scrolling scene costumes overlapped and they're added in the Rippling on the surface and included those attractive bubbles for effect I think it looks pretty sweet and we did it complete the fishcoin Run achievement and look at our view Ward the blue flying fish with oh so much time to enjoy it with this guy once you get out of the water you can hold up and fly high into the sky but watch out because as soon as you release the up key you begin to fall and you cannot fly up again until you reach the floor it's so easy to accidentally fall down a hole and lose your power what I'm heading for is the giant station and we can pick up the it was this big achievement as always this doesn't last long so get yourself down to the mini station for its Twin power shrimp now careful as you fly we have 60 seconds to find our way back to the water and it's not super easy with the weird flying control scheme of this little fellow almost there yes the Curious Case of Benjamin salmon shout out in the comments if you know why this achievement is called that okay so since we are in the water let's swim to this interesting looking area to the far left of the level so although I got here as a fish you can also get here by performing some fast underwater jumping techniques too I'm going to discard the flying fish so that I can get the achievement for this tricky climb you really have to perfect wall jumping and the Art of jumping from the highest point holding down the jump key for as long as possible to get the full jump height and also not jumping too early in fact you can almost run off a ledge before you jump to get the furthest jump possible and in this climb you really need every bit of distance you can muster and here we are ultimate solo aquaclim achieved it was worth the effort and here we are ready to jump into the awesome Flappy Bird station you can just sit on the button a little longer and tell everybody that the Flappy Bird station is open for business oh no I hit the r key what no can you believe it oh great I respawned I'll have to go back oh fine thank you very much where are you taking me to oh nice well since we are back at the butterfly Station high up above the gravity pig let me show you another fun achievement that is to be had flap your way down to the mini station and tell me what is a small butterfly yeah it's The Hungry Caterpillar of course just fulfilling one of my childhood dreams right here don't all these Foods look yummy hmm trick is can we find all 15 in only 240 seconds one treat that a lot of people Miss is the one through the Gap in this clip and we can easily squeeze through in this cute body shape yeah and there's another down by the water just eight to go one over the pony station and three more up towards the Nyan Cat station but luckily not on the very top that would have been there we have one above the mini station just three to go come on another above the UFO platforms huge jump now yeah just two to go oh so this one is the last one amazing we have completed the Hungry Caterpillar challenge so cool and we'll have earned a very stylish hat for that you can be sure oh wow luck is surely on my side as it looks like this helpful UFO player is giving us a free ride up to the Giant Station thank you mate we have the supersized caterpillar achievement but what should we do next okay uh flying under the bridge we just need any flying power for this one nion cat will do or the UFO and then we fly down under the little Bridge directly below the mini station careful not to go down too low and we earn the fly under the bridge achievement also if we hover around in here for 10 seconds we also pick up the waiting for Three Billy Goats award two and the fun doesn't stop there since we have this new station at fingertips pop in there for the snail station power up this Avatar is indeed very fun but you'll have to work on telling your left from your ride as you begin to travel upside down also there's a new mini game to be played so press up to reach out for the treats above you and also hold space to reach out in front of you too now if you've played many of my scratch games then you may recognize this idea comes from my pen game called Snail so although we can't jump we can reach out with our head and pull ourselves across gaps and up to platforms that we otherwise could not have reached this course is a bit of a puzzle but just let the purple snail treats lead them way there's certainly a lot of interesting shapes to be navigated around and at some points you may find you just need to fall and that's no problem we just hold the down key to release our grip and as everyone knows a snail always lands on their feet and off we go again almost there now and done snail treat minigame achieved and we have the rainbow snail and of course another beautiful MiniGame hat to show off do that rainbow snail dance I love that one where's the Flappy Bird station well follow me my friend watch how we get to the Flappy Bird station without a fish power up now use your jump momentum to power down through the water and then jump off the bottom to carefully navigate without getting snagged to the solo climb area gosh I hope they make it oh sad they didn't maybe they'll get to watch this video but at least permafron is already here at the top cool right then let's do this Flappy Bird station and I'm not going to lie everybody knows Flappy Bird is hard so this Flappy Bird minigame is really tough for beginners touching the floor or the ceiling is an instant game over unlike traditional Flappy Bird though we can change direction which does make this a little interesting don't touch the water though over the gravity Pig station we go and then head down the cliff and back up the pony station okay our first small Gap up is easier than down so you just wait plunge down carefully and this one is so close to the surface oh no I touched the ground one mistake and it's all over at least we get reset back to the start of the Flappy Bird game so that we can play it again and again right then here we go drop down through the Gap and quickly back up a small pause before Uturn and now we're in the thick of it careful not to touch the floor or ceiling oh no I missed that one hold on careful does it this one's Mega tight yes and then come on this is it that was crazy nice one achievement 69 completed the floppy coin run how about that we have the Rainbow Man and they're wearing a most Splendid Flappy Bird hat too so Chic what's not to love and still 30 more achievements to go wow hey remember that snail get them in the water or the pond snail achievement and then help out some friends at the Flappy Bird station by standing on that button The Climb helper then off we fly once more but this time forget those coins we're heading directly right across the entire level we want the Giant Station and it's always directly to the right of the Nyan Cat station here of course here it is now we have to be careful ah yes we are in for the reverse Evolution Rex achievement of course and no time to lose let's put these Jaws to good use and snack on some players spam that space key to get chomping this chap looks tasty yum thank you man that's the big eat achievement in the bag I just want to get this Dino into the mini station but we can't jump that high so we must go the long way around and getting your footing is a little tricky oops over 60 seconds to go though we'll make it yes there we go and we're in mini Rex achievement 74. what a cute dinosaur this is a good chance to show off all our hard work by comparing our hats look at all these Beauties I see these guys have all completed the Flappy Bird challenge too nice job guys talking of hats there's another we haven't yet earned but for that we need to go back to the Flappy Bird station once more and this time head or the mini station now we can come in from either the left or the right but it but it's really quite hard to get it first time however I'm feeling lucky yes we have the you chicken achievement I made it look easy and it's really not hey and also look at that we gained the mini flap achievement too there's a fun mini game attached to this little chap just above the station has appeared a collectible pile of red bird seeds yet another reference to a famous retro arcade game which some of you might recognize do tell me if you know now in this mini game there are many seeds to be collected and they don't appear in a forced order therefore we have to find our own fastest path around the level luckily this chick is no slouch so who recognizes this little bird shout out in the comments if you know where you've seen him before hello fellow Flappy oh odia oh no I miss that platform I'm going to pay for that I really hope I can complete this still okay don't give up run little chick run like you've never run before and I'm going to have to double back here to get that missed seed from the top platform then for maximum effort Geronimo easy and the seeds are mine but gosh only four five seconds remain on the clock to find 29 more seeds I'm not sure if I'm gonna make this in time taking the low road then up and down oh no missed that oh come on and down 30 seconds and still 26 seeds this is going to be tight oh and I'm not getting these jumps spot on and we've got to be perfect now to have a chance of beating this run I'm really conscious that we still have the water area to get across and it's so easy to slow down there jump and down oh cool like a duck to water up onto the lily six seconds and we need to get this wall jump first time please oh no oh no yes oh gosh that was so close seriously with one second on the clock wow what a version that was chick dash run achieved achievement 78 and look we get a rainbow chick and an awesome gold chick hat for our efforts I'd love to hear how many of you managed to get this achievement you can certainly call yourself a cloud platformer fun Pro if you can show off this hat oh are we going for a ride I hope we're off to the Giant Station yes please I'll give them a hint just in case carry me to the Giant Station Squire excellent up we go who do I have to thank tiger foxy you star you have helped me get the giant chick achievement only 20 more to go wow it's crazy how much there is to do in this game isn't it let's see if I missed a few obvious ones oh yes there's the mini UFO get the UFO any way you can and then make your way oh man like I said make your way to the mini station achievement 80 mini UFO and then up up we go or the mothership achievement now I don't yet have that giant Pony but nobody's around to carry me up ah so change of plan Pony over to the jetpack station or however you want to get here and simply fly directly up to snag the giant jetpack achievement that usually is one of the first on my list to do check my list gravity expert that's simple enough get the gravity Pig and mash the space key to flip up and down and that's it gravity expert hey I don't know how many people have worked out this next one it's the vertically confused snail you need to find your way to the snail station but enter it upside down as the gravity Pig Yeah vertically confused snail now what makes this snail weird is that when you press down instead of falling downwards you now fall upwards instead and that's why you get this vertical Avo as a guide to let you know the direction of gravity so watch this pressing down and up we go so fun although I think I may regret falling upwards quite so soon the only way is up baby for you and me now so oh well at least we got another achievement space snail and I'm back for more this time I'll get as far right of the level as I can and with luck as we fall all the way up the Giant Station yay one giant snail coming up cleaning up some of those missing achievements number 87 is the mini Toad and I really want help from someone to take my pony self to the Giant Station and in doing so we've picked up the Chatterbox achievement ah fantastic a shout out to 2573 awesome for answering my call but this is not quite the fastest route and time is really limited oh I'm not sure we're gonna make it ah so close but no cigar not that I like cigars in fact man I hate them don't smoke kids and I don't feel like hanging around so how about we go and get the minion achievement instead I'll simply gravity pig to the top of the level and then go left An Elegant inverse jump 10 out of 10 from the judges and then hop into this extra yellow station and we get the it's a Minion Time achievement brilliant and this is another character I need help with but first what else can I do alone Fish Out of Water yeah no problem become a fish and then hop back on the bank that's always fun fish out of water that was achievement number 90. then um ah Astro fish okay we need to complete the fish coin run mini game once again and then fly fly to the sky and into space or Astro fish nice what do you know we also snagged planetary Explorer for going into space a good few times great we are almost there only eight left to get grab that minion power per game and simply say banana earning us the speak like a minion achievement what I really want is some guys to come and join me so I can get three minions in one place at the same time hmm anyone okay well this one is easy I can guarantee you'll have got this one already just run out of breath four lost at sea and oh how did I miss this one Mindy minion only five left I can do the authentic Flappy Bird myself just do as Flappy Bird does and fail a whole load of time there got it authentic Flappy Bird only one task remains that doesn't require any help from other players and that is the daisy Dash mini game piggy to the butterfly station and this time clever friend all the flowers will be mine because I've remembered where that last flower is it's at the Giant Station of course oh man how infuriatingly cunning and out of the way that is Nyon station has one and the Giant Station of course yay one on The Descent and another in the toad in the hole grab the mini station flower but don't go in don't miss the one below us too just five more to go catch one just above on the steps and back down to spawn just need to double back as I remembered one is just the right of Nyan Cat only 15 seconds to go oh gosh continuing across from Spawn only one more six seconds here it is yes got it Daisy Dash minigame achieved and what a beautiful blue butterfly we have become I expect there will be a dashing hat to go along with it and now it is up to my fellow scratches to help me get these last three let's first try getting the hardest one the the giant Pony so don't become a pony until the last second because time is really against you on this one okay here we go pink chicken 42 no they were obviously on a mission let's try again hey there Seth Rox help me please this looks promising yay but do they know the best route uh oh getting a little snagged

it yes wonderful Mega Pony achieved that's achievement 98 at long last thank you Seth Rox you Legend and we are down to the last two achievements and these are both minion related we need to attract
