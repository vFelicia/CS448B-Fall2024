00:00 - foreign
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers and what do you
00:05 - know about Mouse pointer lock and why is
00:08 - it something we should care about after
00:10 - all a mouse is a mouse and we can
00:12 - happily click buttons draw pictures and
00:14 - play our games
00:16 - but all these Mouse movements are
00:18 - restricted to the size of our
00:20 - application window so Along Comes Mouse
00:23 - pointer lock as the name suggests in
00:26 - this control scheme the pointer is
00:28 - locked in place on the screen and then
00:31 - it's up to us to choose what the mouse
00:34 - now does we'd often choose it to pan the
00:36 - background like this and the benefit is
00:39 - that we are now completely free of any
00:42 - limitations on the Windows size the
00:44 - mouse pointer is no longer moving you
00:47 - see and we can simply continue dragging
00:49 - forever
00:51 - this can be especially useful for
00:53 - panning mats in drawing apps and to
00:56 - control our 3D games you see with the
01:00 - mouse pointer lock enabled we can
01:02 - finally keep our Crosshair Central and
01:04 - freely rotate our view with the mouse
01:07 - without ever hitting the boundaries off
01:09 - the edge of the screen the sad news then
01:11 - is scratch doesn't support this mode at
01:16 - least not the vanilla scratch that we
01:18 - all know and love but I'm sure many of
01:21 - you have already heard of Garber muffin
01:23 - and his super impressive scratch mod
01:26 - named turbo War yes in Turbo warp we can
01:29 - load up our favorite scratch projects
01:31 - and run them so so much faster than in
01:34 - vanilla scratch gosh it's just a joy but
01:37 - it doesn't stop there Garber muffin also
01:40 - provides a special version specifically
01:42 - set up with mouse pointer lock enabled
01:45 - woohoo to try this out for yourself I've
01:49 - provided a link in the description under
01:51 - this video the site is found at
01:56 - experiments.turboar.org
01:57 - pointer lock a bit of a mouthful so you
02:01 - might want to follow that link so this
02:04 - looks like scratch right but right away
02:06 - you'll find the mouse in the running
02:07 - projects behaves very differently let's
02:10 - test this out make a forever Loop that
02:12 - sends the Sprite to the mouse pointer
02:14 - and click to make the mouse X and Y
02:16 - visible on the screen and so after
02:18 - clicking the green flag we have to kick
02:20 - again on the stage to activate the mouse
02:23 - first thing to note is that the mouse
02:25 - pointer has disappeared and that's fair
02:27 - enough we're replacing it with the
02:29 - Crosshair in our game anyhow to bring
02:31 - back the mouse cursor we just need to
02:33 - remember to hit the Escape key
02:35 - now if we move the mouse slowly to the
02:37 - left it Jiggles a lot and to the right
02:40 - hmm interesting we don't get very far
02:42 - and as soon as we stop moving it snaps
02:45 - back to the center
02:47 - so rather than the mouse X and Y
02:49 - representing the position of the mouse
02:51 - they are now reporting the distance that
02:53 - the mouse has moved since the last
02:55 - screen refresh we can test this Theory
02:57 - by changing the position of the Sprite
02:59 - by Mouse X and mouse y note that we are
03:02 - changing not setting the position now
03:04 - and look at that now it moves around
03:07 - just like a normal Mouse would I mean
03:09 - wow I have a Dango mouse cursor how cool
03:13 - is this
03:14 - well then shall we try this out with our
03:17 - awesome 3D raycaster to load your
03:20 - projects Into Turbo warp either they
03:22 - have to be shared on scratch or you have
03:24 - to save the project as a file on our
03:26 - computer then in Turbo warp we can use
03:29 - the file load from your computer and
03:32 - select a file and then we are ready to
03:35 - go in fact the game sort of works
03:38 - already only left and right movement is
03:40 - super sluggish and the up and down is
03:42 - just glitchy and this is to be expected
03:45 - also do notice that the Crosshair is
03:48 - jumping around all over the place so
03:50 - let's start there click into the
03:52 - Crosshair Sprite we want to fix this in
03:55 - place but only if we are running the
03:58 - project with the pointer lock enabled
04:00 - luckily we can detect this make a new
04:04 - variable let me get pointer lock for all
04:07 - Sprites
04:08 - and set it to
04:10 - and we're going to check whether the
04:11 - mouse X and mouse y are both equal to
04:14 - zero that means pointer lock will be
04:17 - true only if the mouse is perfectly
04:19 - centered on the screen when the flag is
04:22 - clicked
04:23 - so to fix the Crosshair in place we just
04:26 - want to stop it following the mouse
04:27 - surround the forever loop with an if
04:30 - pointer lock is equal to zero that's no
04:33 - pointer lock
04:35 - we can test that out and confirm that
04:37 - pointer lock is true and consequently
04:39 - the Crosshair no longer moves around
04:40 - with our mouse that is looking good
04:44 - so let's take a look at the player
04:46 - rotation
04:48 - click back into the player Sprite and
04:50 - find our player tick script we're going
04:52 - to have two modes of control so surround
04:55 - the get mouse turn with an if else block
04:58 - like this
04:59 - the default original control scheme is
05:02 - used when pointer lock is again zero
05:05 - but now when point lock is enabled we
05:08 - instead set turn directly to now
05:12 - remembering when the pointer is locked
05:13 - Mouse X returns how far the mouse has
05:15 - moved which is exactly what we want to
05:18 - turn by
05:19 - only we divide by four as otherwise it's
05:22 - a little too fast but you can find that
05:24 - out by having a play
05:25 - so I'm expecting this is going to be
05:28 - pretty awesome except what well
05:31 - something has gone very wrong here we're
05:34 - always turning left I can't understand
05:37 - what that would be unless oh man a turn
05:42 - by block has suspiciously appeared at
05:44 - the bottom of my script I bet it just
05:46 - accidentally attached itself that is the
05:48 - danger of leaving blocks floating around
05:49 - on your script area oh well here we go
05:52 - yes I can move left and right and the
05:55 - turn is perfectly synced to my mouse
05:58 - movements without any weird glidy after
06:01 - effects and we can turn right and keep
06:03 - turning and keep turning without ever
06:06 - hitting the edge of the screen it's
06:07 - awesome
06:09 - well then I guess we should also modify
06:12 - the up and down movements in the same
06:14 - vein
06:16 - we'll need to reposition this set camera
06:18 - Y block so that it only works like this
06:21 - when pointer lock is equal to zero
06:23 - and then in the else when point lock is
06:26 - enabled we need to change camera y by
06:30 - Mouse y instead I find that a good speed
06:33 - of movement can be got by multiplying
06:35 - this by 1.5 but we shouldn't also forget
06:38 - to multiply the value by Delta if you
06:42 - remember this was our frame rate
06:44 - smoothing value so that if the game runs
06:46 - faster or slower we allow for that here
06:49 - great run the project and see what you
06:53 - think and I've got to tell you this is
06:55 - the bee's knees it's exactly what we
06:58 - want our game controls to feel like so
07:00 - responsive and immediate in all
07:02 - directions the only gribe I have is that
07:05 - now we need to limit how far up and down
07:08 - we can look this was one place our
07:10 - previous Mouse limits actually helped us
07:12 - out so anyway it's a quick job if the
07:16 - camera y becomes greater than 180 that's
07:19 - the previous maximum Mouse y
07:22 - then we set camera y back to 180 so it
07:26 - can't get any larger
07:27 - else if camera Y is less than
07:32 - negative 180
07:35 - we do the same setting camera y back to
07:38 - negative
07:39 - 180. wonderful assuming we didn't do
07:43 - anything wrong then we can give that a
07:45 - full test out
07:48 - and yeah it's really quite something
07:51 - when you remember that this is even
07:53 - running in scratch and because this is
07:55 - Turbo warp you'll find it also runs
07:57 - super well at even better resolutions
07:59 - without breaking a sweat
08:04 - so a huge shout out to Garber muffin for
08:07 - making this all possible if you want to
08:09 - bring your edited project back into
08:11 - scratch then just save it here and in
08:14 - scratch use the file load from your
08:16 - computer and once your project is
08:18 - officially shared it will work in both
08:20 - scratch and turbo warp with or without
08:23 - Mouse lock enabled of course we can
08:26 - always hope that one day scratch will
08:28 - officially support this awesome feature
08:30 - but until then turbo walk is the place
08:32 - to go and on that note this is the end
08:36 - of this little video please don't forget
08:38 - to smash that like button if you found
08:40 - this useful and want more exciting
08:42 - scratch topics like this covering it's
08:44 - been fun venturing a little further
08:46 - outside of our normal realm and do
08:48 - subscribe to the channel so as not to
08:49 - miss the next exciting video the moment
08:51 - it comes out and toggle that Bell icon
08:54 - to make absolutely sure and with that I
08:56 - wish you all the best for the week ahead
08:59 - and scratch on guys
