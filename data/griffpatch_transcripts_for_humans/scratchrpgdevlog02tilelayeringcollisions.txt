00:02 - hello fellow scratchers welcome back to
00:05 - episode 2 of my devlog building an RPG a
00:08 - role-playing game in scratch this
00:10 - project is destined to be one huge epic
00:13 - tutorial so to ensure I get things right
00:15 - before the official tutorials begin I'm
00:18 - documenting my journey so you can join
00:20 - in the fun last time I shared how I
00:23 - managed to get a working tile scrolling
00:25 - engine and began work on an awesome
00:26 - level editor but there were problems
00:29 - specifically gaps appearing between
00:31 - tiles gosh I mean look at this tree so
00:34 - stay tuned for a look at how this can be
00:36 - fixed and later on find out why
00:38 - Collision detection in this project
00:40 - almost brought me to tears yes it's true
00:43 - are you ready let's delve in well let's
00:48 - start with these ugly tile edges I knew
00:51 - when I picked this tile set that this
00:52 - would be an opportunity to try something
00:54 - new many of the tiles are not full
00:57 - squares but instead have transparent
00:59 - masked regions and only look good when
01:02 - they're layered on top of another full
01:04 - tile the existing tile grid system I
01:07 - have only supports a single layer of
01:09 - tiles but it's no big deal to duplicate
01:11 - that up and then have a way to set which
01:14 - layer I want to edit in the editor here
01:17 - I am editing layer 1 the bottom layer
01:19 - once the grass is placed down I can
01:22 - switch to layer 2 using the number 2 key
01:24 - on my keyboard and begin laying down the
01:26 - tree again oh yes this is much better do
01:31 - you see how the grass shows through the
01:33 - edges of the tree perfect let me do the
01:36 - same for the raised area below
01:38 - smooth out our layer 1 and then on layer
01:41 - 2 brush in the raised grass area again
01:45 - super I'm really liking that and it
01:49 - doesn't stop with these costumes we can
01:51 - also now bring in one of the larger
01:54 - structures like this awesome looking
01:55 - house as you can see the layering works
01:59 - great now I'll just stop there as I
02:01 - don't have a lot of room but what I
02:04 - wanted to show you was this although
02:06 - having two layers allows us to fix the
02:08 - issue with costumes overlapping we could
02:11 - take this further what if we were
02:13 - walking behind this house shouldn't this
02:16 - high up roof appear layered in front of
02:18 - the player the same goes for this tree
02:20 - right well watch this I'll remove the
02:23 - upper portion of the house from layer 2
02:25 - and introduce the new layer 3. if we
02:29 - assume our player is standing on layer 2
02:31 - then everything we paint on layer 3 is
02:34 - above them and so it is we can create
02:37 - this really fun illusion of depth we can
02:40 - walk in front of the house but also
02:43 - behind it so cool layer 3 is in front of
02:47 - the player this same applies to this
02:49 - tree that makes the level so much more
02:52 - immersive you might realize quite
02:54 - quickly that certain tile costumes will
02:57 - consistently need placing on the same
02:58 - layers so to speed up the placement I
03:01 - added a cool feature to assign a default
03:03 - layer to each tile type in the tile
03:05 - palette see that the ground tiles are
03:08 - all on layer 1 the Treetops layer 3 and
03:11 - the tree trunk on layer 2 and you'll
03:14 - love this I can change the default layer
03:16 - right within the editor just by tapping
03:18 - the number Keys cool stuff so let's see
03:22 - this in action I can switch to Auto
03:24 - layer mode and lay down a tree
03:31 - to confirm it worked we just check we
03:34 - can walk around it what a cool feature
03:38 - but I can't help but wish there was as a
03:41 - way to speed up tile placement
03:43 - especially for these larger assets that
03:45 - are constructed from many many smaller
03:47 - tiles it just gets so tedious in our
03:51 - Mario tutorial we introduced tile Auto
03:54 - arranging do you remember that where
03:55 - tiles would automatically switch as we
03:58 - drew to make them fit together correctly
04:00 - that was sweet but for a tile set of
04:03 - this complexity it might be tricky
04:06 - but because of the tiles are already
04:08 - laid out in the same order we want to
04:10 - lay them down I came up with another
04:12 - idea to make this work I think you're
04:14 - going to love this too
04:16 - what I can do is hold down space before
04:19 - I start drawing and then as I move
04:22 - across with my mouse the selected tile
04:24 - in the tiles palette also switches in
04:27 - the same direction I move this way in no
04:30 - time at all I can lay down an entire
04:32 - house wow look at that and it's done it
04:36 - with all the correct layers too so cool
04:40 - also if I move into some free space see
04:43 - how I can press space and just move my
04:45 - mouse around so even without drawing I
04:48 - can switch costume this way I can pick
04:50 - out the exact costume I'm after without
04:52 - having to click over in the palette to
04:54 - the right this also works for more
04:56 - intricate structures I can choose when
04:58 - to move on to the next tile costume as I
05:00 - draw as it follows an easy predict
05:02 - pattern well since we can change
05:04 - costumes so easily now we can even work
05:08 - full screen without having the need to
05:10 - have the palette visible now that is
05:12 - really useful and I can still pick to
05:15 - use any tile visible on the screen using
05:16 - the tile picker e key and then continue
05:19 - to work from there so the building
05:21 - process is super optimized now which is
05:24 - fantastic news for us imagine how much
05:26 - faster we will be able to put together
05:28 - and try out our RPG worlds yeah of
05:32 - course there are still a few layering
05:35 - combinations that are just not possible
05:36 - with three layers so we need to just
05:39 - work around them for the time I'm being
05:41 - clever level design has always been a
05:43 - big part of tile based adventure games
05:45 - man this is all looking so so cool I
05:49 - just can't wait to make this into a game
05:51 - are you as excited as me yeah okay guys
05:55 - the editor is really shining so I
05:57 - decided it was time to focus on the
05:59 - actual player and their movement in the
06:01 - game or more specifically where they
06:04 - can't walk due to a tile Collision
06:06 - now because we are stamping costumes we
06:09 - don't have the luxury of using scratch's
06:11 - Sprite touching blocks instead we have
06:14 - to go off the tile grid list contents we
06:17 - know which tiles our player is touching
06:19 - and we work from there the simplest
06:22 - approach would be to tag each tile
06:24 - costume with a straightforward I am
06:26 - solid I am not solid status then we can
06:30 - calculate if the tile We Touch is solid
06:31 - we stop the player and if not we can
06:34 - walk on but in the tile sheet that I
06:37 - chose things are not that clear-cut
06:40 - these tiles for example are certainly
06:43 - not fully solid but they do have solid
06:46 - edges it appears so my next idea was to
06:49 - Define which edges of each tile are
06:51 - solid I coded up an awesome Edge editor
06:54 - right into the level editor so I could
06:57 - quickly sketch on the solid edges per
06:59 - tile and then I got to work scripting up
07:02 - the Collision code and no it wasn't
07:05 - quite as straightforward as I hoped but
07:08 - I got there and here we go I can tell
07:10 - you things are working pretty sweet well
07:13 - for some time at least I kept this
07:16 - design but problems have emerged
07:19 - some of the tiles in the tile set don't
07:21 - fit with my Edge Collision Concept as
07:24 - the Collision edges in the costumes
07:26 - don't align to the edge of the Sprite at
07:28 - all this was very upsetting after all
07:32 - that hard work and I was a little
07:33 - stumped as what best to do
07:36 - so I thought if the tiles were designed
07:38 - with half tile collisions in mind maybe
07:40 - defining which quarters are solid and
07:43 - which are not would be a better system
07:45 - yes I had to recode it all and no it
07:49 - didn't work
07:51 - I sadly forgotten I'd need to factor in
07:53 - the cases where the Collision edges were
07:55 - paper thin rubbish
07:58 - never mind so what back to edges we
08:01 - could use edges but segment them into
08:04 - half edges oh man this is getting far
08:07 - too complicated and then I had a
08:09 - different idea how about rather than
08:12 - edges we switched to nine pins in each
08:16 - tile each pin could be solid or not and
08:20 - the rule is that the player's hitbox
08:22 - cannot pass through a pin as long as the
08:24 - hitbox is bigger than the distance
08:27 - between the pins then we could never
08:29 - pass through a gap yeah that was it this
08:33 - was a system I was happy enough with it
08:36 - worked and that was not deadly hard to
08:39 - script oh thank goodness and thank you
08:43 - for watching my devlog if you're excited
08:45 - to get started with the actual tutorial
08:47 - then smash that like button now and let
08:50 - me know what you are most excited about
08:52 - in the comments below the video don't
08:55 - forget to subscribe to the channel too
08:56 - I'm thinking we might begin next week
08:59 - with a tutorial on the text engine as
09:01 - that will be super useful both for this
09:03 - RPG and many other projects besides so
09:07 - yeah subscribe and make sure to check
09:09 - that Bell icon too in the meantime work
09:11 - on this RPG continues and with the help
09:13 - of Crystal keeper 7 do check out his
09:16 - YouTube channel we have begun to expand
09:18 - and update our tile set too but that's
09:21 - it for today I hope you have a great
09:23 - week ahead and scratch on guys
09:25 - [Music]
09:37 - thank you
09:40 - [Music]
10:01 - thank you
