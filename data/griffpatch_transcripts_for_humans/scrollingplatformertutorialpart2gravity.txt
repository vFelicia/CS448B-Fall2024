00:00 - hi I'm Griff patch I'm going to take you
00:02 - through part 2 of my tutorial on making
00:04 - a scrolling platformer in scratch we
00:07 - left this off with as little red dude
00:09 - being able to move along and the
00:11 - background scrolling but that's not
00:13 - particularly exciting and we really need
00:15 - to bring him back down to earth so today
00:17 - we're looking at gravity so let me just
00:20 - minimize the play area with this little
00:21 - button here so we have a bit more
00:23 - scripting area and let's get started
00:25 - that's what we really need to do is
00:27 - create a new custom block called change
00:30 - layer Y by and now we need to go into
00:35 - options here and add a number input
00:38 - we're going to call it s why click OK ok
00:43 - so let's take that down here and what
00:47 - this is going to do is change it but
00:50 - let's change variable and put in Y in
00:56 - drag yes Y parameter into the change
01:00 - part so we're changing Y by whatever s Y
01:03 - is and then we need to reposition the
01:07 - character now that is done already by
01:09 - this go to that we're using over here so
01:11 - what we can do is pop that go-to into a
01:13 - new custom block and then we use it
01:16 - again so it's create a new custom block
01:17 - called position and then put that go-to
01:24 - into that make sure that tick goes back
01:27 - into the claim code at the end of that
01:29 - loop and then put the new position block
01:33 - where it was saying go to before
01:35 - so that's man should be doing exactly
01:37 - the same thing as it was but we're using
01:39 - this custom block instead that means we
01:42 - can now reuse position over here so
01:46 - we're going to change Y and then
01:47 - reposition so grab this new change Y
01:51 - position and stick that in the tick
01:53 - custom block for now let's change Y by
01:58 - minus 8 so downwards by minus 8 okay
02:02 - let's watch that there we go every time
02:05 - you run the project he moves down
02:07 - constantly at a speed of 8 pixels per
02:10 - tick so the Nick
02:12 - step is let's try and stop him from
02:14 - going to be that platform okay for that
02:20 - what we have to do is as he comes down
02:22 - if he's touching the platform we need to
02:27 - move him up out of the platform so let's
02:30 - add in a control repeat until and we're
02:35 - going to repeat until we're not touching
02:39 - the platform any longer
02:41 - so repeat until touching they're not
02:46 - mouse pointer we want platforms now
02:47 - that's the platform sprite here so any
02:50 - of these platforms that we have cicely
02:54 - me repeat until we're not touching it
02:55 - and what we're gonna repeat is what's
02:58 - inside here what's inside here is gonna
03:01 - be change Y by one so I move up by one
03:07 - and then use again your position custom
03:10 - block so we actually do the
03:12 - repositioning okay just save that run it
03:17 - and see what happens there we go let me
03:21 - make that bigger now you see what's
03:23 - happening here what's happening is he's
03:25 - falling down by eight going through it
03:27 - and then rising up one pixel at a time
03:29 - like just like we said repeat until he's
03:31 - not touching it but it's that thing is
03:33 - then you can see him fall through again
03:34 - and come back up again so what we really
03:37 - need to do is do this so quick that we
03:39 - don't see it happen so that he'll fall
03:40 - down and look like he's sitting on top
03:42 - luckily that's very achievable in
03:44 - scratch all we need to do is change our
03:47 - tick custom block here this tick is
03:49 - supposed to be really quick that's why
03:51 - we called it tick like a tick of a clock
03:52 - so right click on it say edit go into
03:56 - options and say run without screen
03:59 - refresh so the problem is at the moment
04:02 - when we're moving him about the thing
04:03 - out of the platform scratch is telling
04:06 - it to update the screen as show it
04:07 - happening we do not want that so run
04:09 - without screen refresh and now let's run
04:12 - it again there we go he falls down and
04:17 - he stops on the block
04:23 - now the next thing we want to do is stop
04:26 - him from falling down at a constant
04:28 - speed because that's not very realistic
04:29 - we usually when we're walking along and
04:32 - falling we get faster the longer we fall
04:34 - for so let's make a few changes for that
04:37 - if we go into data we can add a new
04:40 - variable called s Y speed Y and we'll
04:43 - make it for this sprite only so we need
04:47 - to set speed Y to zero at the beginning
04:49 - in your game on custom block so that
04:52 - we're not falling to start with and then
04:56 - where we've got change player Y by minus
04:59 - 8 add in a change speed Y before it by
05:05 - minus 1 no one is to actually it better
05:08 - change speed Y by minus 2 and then where
05:11 - it says change layer Y by minus 8 drag
05:14 - in your speed Y so now the speed y the
05:19 - speed he's falling at it's gonna get
05:20 - bigger each time and we're gonna call
05:22 - this change player Y by a bigger
05:24 - negative number so straight away that
05:26 - should start to happen there we go
05:30 - however when he hits the platform we
05:33 - don't slow him down
05:34 - and in the end he gets so fast that he
05:35 - falls to it which is not what we want
05:37 - and that could be easily fixed so in
05:40 - here this little loop down here with a
05:42 - change Blair why get a set and set the
05:47 - speed Y to 0 inside that repeat so when
05:52 - he is touching a platform it'll set off
05:54 - speed Y to 0 and now play it then he
05:59 - stops and if we walk off the end you'll
06:00 - see he starts falling again until he
06:03 - hits the bottom and then that stops it
06:04 - that's fine and they're normal
06:07 - circumstances will happen to die there
06:09 - so that's great we've got some gravity
06:12 - going off and I think about that is we
06:14 - can easily add in a jumping mechanism
06:15 - now that will go in the tick block as I
06:20 - just move that to change player Y down a
06:21 - bit let's put another if statement in
06:25 - and we'll put it just before the speed Y
06:29 - change
06:31 - and we need a key press of up and in
06:37 - there we're gonna set speed y2 16 okay
06:47 - now if we run out and press up instantly
06:52 - we can do some jumping now this is
06:54 - actually more like flying if I hold it
06:55 - down I can just keep going hovering
06:58 - around like this which is quite good for
07:00 - like a flappy bird game or something
07:02 - but not what we want for a platformer so
07:06 - what I need to do now is make him so
07:08 - he's only now to jump if he's been
07:10 - touching the platforms for this another
07:14 - variable is needed and we're gonna call
07:16 - this in air and again this sprite only
07:21 - so set in air to zero when the game on
07:27 - is hit and what we gonna do is when a
07:32 - change in air inside the change player
07:35 - why we're gonna change it by one now
07:40 - this means it's gonna keep saying he's
07:43 - one in the air for longer the more he's
07:46 - in the air and when we touch a platform
07:48 - we're gonna set you know back to zero so
07:52 - it'll be zero for as long as he's
07:54 - touching something and that in air will
07:57 - be bigger than zero when he's in the air
07:59 - the long is in the air the bigger that
08:01 - number becomes and that means that we
08:04 - can use that in the jumping code so if
08:07 - we put an if statement around the set
08:09 - speed y2 16 then we can put a less than
08:16 - and we can put in air so if in air is
08:21 - less than four we'll choose now for the
08:26 - number i've chosen which is a little
08:27 - number so if he's in the air for the
08:30 - tiniest bit after he's left the edge of
08:34 - a platform you can still do a jump now
08:36 - this is quite important for some
08:37 - platformers to make it easy enough to
08:40 - jump because sometimes if you're going
08:41 - down slopes or things you're kind of
08:42 - skipping along down the slope and he's
08:44 - four tiny bits of it but that would mean
08:46 - you wouldn't be able to jump while
08:47 - you're skipping down a slope and that
08:49 - can be really frustrating for players so
08:51 - it's always a nice give a little bit of
08:52 - leeway so if I run that now get out make
08:55 - it big so I can jump but look if I hold
08:59 - down the UP button
09:00 - he only jumps when he gets back to the
09:01 - ground which is what we wanted I can't
09:05 - jump double jump in the air there we go
09:08 - it's not jumping mechanism and so that's
09:13 - the end of this tutorial
09:15 - in the next tutorial you'll hopefully
09:17 - cover things like collision detection in
09:20 - the sideways direction so we can get
09:22 - bump into objects in that direction and
09:24 - also ceiling detection both of those
09:26 - things if you try this current example
09:28 - out you'll find will do very strange
09:30 - things and they're very necessary in any
09:33 - platforming going to make them really
09:35 - stable so I hope you'll join me next
09:37 - time and I enjoyed that today this is
09:39 - Griff patch and I thank you for watching
09:41 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi I'm Griff patch I'm going to take you through part 2 of my tutorial on making a scrolling platformer in scratch we left this off with as little red dude being able to move along and the background scrolling but that's not particularly exciting and we really need to bring him back down to earth so today we're looking at gravity so let me just minimize the play area with this little button here so we have a bit more scripting area and let's get started that's what we really need to do is create a new custom block called change layer Y by and now we need to go into options here and add a number input we're going to call it s why click OK ok so let's take that down here and what this is going to do is change it but let's change variable and put in Y in drag yes Y parameter into the change part so we're changing Y by whatever s Y is and then we need to reposition the character now that is done already by this go to that we're using over here so what we can do is pop that goto into a new custom block and then we use it again so it's create a new custom block called position and then put that goto into that make sure that tick goes back into the claim code at the end of that loop and then put the new position block where it was saying go to before so that's man should be doing exactly the same thing as it was but we're using this custom block instead that means we can now reuse position over here so we're going to change Y and then reposition so grab this new change Y position and stick that in the tick custom block for now let's change Y by minus 8 so downwards by minus 8 okay let's watch that there we go every time you run the project he moves down constantly at a speed of 8 pixels per tick so the Nick step is let's try and stop him from going to be that platform okay for that what we have to do is as he comes down if he's touching the platform we need to move him up out of the platform so let's add in a control repeat until and we're going to repeat until we're not touching the platform any longer so repeat until touching they're not mouse pointer we want platforms now that's the platform sprite here so any of these platforms that we have cicely me repeat until we're not touching it and what we're gonna repeat is what's inside here what's inside here is gonna be change Y by one so I move up by one and then use again your position custom block so we actually do the repositioning okay just save that run it and see what happens there we go let me make that bigger now you see what's happening here what's happening is he's falling down by eight
