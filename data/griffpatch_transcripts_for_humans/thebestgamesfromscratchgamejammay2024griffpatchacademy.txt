00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hello fellow scratchers we recently ran
00:03 - our first game Jam within the Griff
00:05 - patch Academy and wow was it a blast the
00:08 - theme was just too much which was wide
00:11 - open to interpretation and so we had
00:14 - over 150 entries ranging from
00:16 - Platformers to puzzlers to animations
00:19 - and yes I played them all and now for
00:22 - your viewing pleasure I will present my
00:24 - top 22 shortlisted projects and pick
00:27 - eight winners across the seven different
00:29 - game genre
00:32 - as you know scratch has a thriving
00:34 - community of animators and their
00:35 - submissions were simply hilarious many
00:38 - projects played with the theme of too
00:40 - much whether that was too much work or
00:42 - too many potatoes or too many ideas but
00:45 - two projects stood out for their
00:47 - Ingenuity quality control by FR wolf UB
00:51 - follows a story of a mad cat scientist
00:54 - and their super duper quality computer
00:56 - TM problem is it requires all the power
00:59 - from the New York City Power Plant to
01:01 - run it and that turns out to be just too
01:05 - much and so this clever Choose Your Own
01:07 - Adventure begins having found yourself
01:10 - dropped into some strange distant land
01:12 - and with an amusing drop in the visual
01:14 - production quality the First Choice
01:16 - intriguingly bids you to enter a time
01:19 - machine and so now having to click the
01:22 - green flag yet again to start the game
01:24 - strangely things are not the same
01:27 - unfortunately a Time Paradox kicks in
01:30 - and the game
01:31 - ends but this is by no means the only
01:35 - ending nope there are 11 of them can you
01:38 - find them all I really appreciate the
01:40 - effort that went into drawing the
01:42 - animations and a cinematic framing of
01:44 - each shot the text engine is also great
01:47 - but perhaps a way to skip through some
01:49 - of the dialogue and scenes even faster
01:50 - would be a bonus but I'm nitpicking here
01:52 - so yeah very cool indeed up against this
01:56 - we have our second animation just to
02:00 - much ideas by Binky Beaver
02:03 - uh Idea Idea Idea like a number of
02:06 - entries this animation focused on the
02:08 - concept of coming up with an idea
02:10 - however this time the protagonist
02:12 - stumbles across the Griff patch Academy
02:14 - which in turn ignites their brain with
02:17 - too much ideas I see what you did there
02:20 - so they get down to it to making a
02:22 - project and then surprise surprise you
02:24 - actually get to play the game right in
02:26 - the middle of the animation that's
02:28 - really quite unique and I love it just a
02:31 - little warning it turns out that too
02:33 - many ideas outside of the Griff patch
02:35 - Academy can lead to hospitalization due
02:37 - to brain overload just thought I'd warn
02:39 - you like with a number of other
02:41 - animation entries Binky Beaver went to
02:43 - the trouble of voice acting their
02:44 - characters which is always Really Brave
02:46 - and can be really difficult so yeah they
02:49 - did a great job ooh so picking a
02:52 - category winner both of these
02:54 - shortlisted projects went above and
02:56 - beyond but I'm going to have to go with
02:59 - quality control troll very cool and well
03:02 - done so our next game submissions are
03:04 - those that fall into the arcade genre
03:07 - and we had a lot of these so I had to
03:10 - split them roughly between General
03:11 - arcade and all round directional
03:13 - Shooters so arcade games these tend to
03:16 - be all about fast level progression
03:18 - upgrades and yes high scores and I've
03:22 - got five shortlisted entries to show you
03:24 - starting with just to Dango by mnnnn
03:29 - 3344
03:30 - the kingdom of cringle Mary is under
03:32 - attack by the infamous Dango horde it is
03:34 - up to us to take on the role of the
03:36 - honorable Knight and fight through these
03:38 - delicious bouncing desserts once you get
03:41 - the hang of the first wave you quickly
03:42 - find that things only get harder from
03:45 - there it's really just one big
03:47 - multi-stage boss battle and we all love
03:49 - boss battles and gosh once you reach the
03:51 - big guy himself it's just too much for
03:54 - me but the repetitive nature of each
03:56 - stage and gradually increasing
03:58 - difficulty lends well to the feeling
04:00 - that with practice you can progress
04:01 - further and faster you just need to
04:04 - figure out your strategy and stick with
04:06 - it it's well-coded looks great and it's
04:08 - a blast to play is it too much well
04:11 - let's see the competition just too much
04:14 - advertisements by Malo and Ouija and I
04:18 - just love this idea and don't we all
04:21 - hate ads thank goodness there aren't any
04:24 - ads in my videos within the Griff patch
04:26 - Academy anyhow this game is essentially
04:29 - a simplified Flappy Bird Style game the
04:31 - catch being you have to also fend off
04:33 - all the pop-up ads that are vying for
04:35 - your attention and man the game would be
04:38 - hard enough without this distraction and
04:40 - it quickly becomes all too much very
04:43 - clever and perhaps just a little too
04:45 - real since sometimes you can't even
04:47 - reach those close buttons since they
04:49 - appear off the
04:50 - screen I think perhaps it would be more
04:52 - fun if there was some kind of difficulty
04:54 - progression starting a bit easier but
04:57 - the concept is very entertaining
05:00 - just too much blocks by Bluey bat games
05:04 - and apparently this game has the best
05:05 - death animation ever if they don't say
05:07 - so themselves well I guess we'll see wow
05:12 - what a Polish Game this is the UI is
05:14 - great with lovely transitions this
05:17 - arcade game is simple you take control
05:19 - of this little white dude who must fend
05:21 - off the incoming enemy cubes by dashing
05:23 - at them with a click of the mouse the
05:25 - early levels are quite relaxed but
05:27 - jumping into level two things really
05:29 - heat up and yes that is a cool death
05:33 - animation nice one entering level three
05:36 - well the game gets quite challenging as
05:38 - there really are just too much blocks
05:41 - but I do enjoy the addition of the large
05:43 - explosive blocks that help you to clear
05:45 - the screen of enemies fast that brings a
05:47 - touch of strategy to the game which is a
05:49 - really nice touch the next project is
05:52 - named switch by
05:54 - Swift now this has a much more laid-back
05:57 - feel to it a unique Twist on the the
05:59 - repetitive vertical shooter where you
06:01 - take control of two individual turrets
06:04 - each guarding their half of the screen
06:06 - the catch is that only one turret can
06:08 - move at once so while one is cycling
06:11 - back and forward dealing death to a wide
06:13 - area the other turret is focused on a
06:15 - single point of course a simple click of
06:18 - the mouse reverses his behavior so we
06:20 - can defend the entire playing field
06:22 - where this mechanic really starts to get
06:24 - interesting is when the larger boss
06:26 - enemies show up these monstrosities
06:28 - require a prolonged bombardment of
06:30 - bullets to clear them from the screen so
06:32 - now things get a lot harder to manage in
06:35 - general I really love this idea it's fun
06:37 - to play but it could be even better if
06:40 - we had more gratifying feedback as our
06:42 - bullets bounced off the enemies some
06:43 - kind of particle effects explosions
06:45 - sounds or screen Shake perhaps and once
06:48 - you play for a while suddenly you get
06:50 - into situations that are simply
06:51 - impossible to beat which is a little
06:54 - frustrating now the last in this
06:56 - category Diamond bouncer by dxr TC SSH
07:01 - now this is a very intriguing project
07:04 - it's ridiculously simple bounce a
07:06 - diamond off your paddle to revent it
07:07 - going off the bottom of the screen yes
07:09 - we've seen it all before right well not
07:12 - in this too much flavor because now with
07:16 - every bounce we get double yes double
07:19 - the number of diamonds so how on Earth
07:21 - are we expected to cope with this well
07:24 - your guess is as good as mine all I can
07:26 - say is seeing that high score of 30
07:28 - drives me to keep playing it's
07:31 - tantalizing to think that somehow you
07:33 - could be the one to get lucky and get
07:35 - that top high score and I think I got
07:38 - pretty good with 13 man is it really
07:41 - possible to get them all I don't know
07:43 - but it drives me mad awesome game and
07:46 - yeah it's just too much okay guys they
07:50 - were our five arcade submissions and
07:52 - what a difficult choice is since they
07:54 - are all so good for different reasons at
07:56 - the end of the day I'm going to have to
07:58 - choose
08:00 - just too much blocks by Bluey bat games
08:02 - for their superb presentation and
08:04 - excellent gameplay what swung it for me
08:07 - was although the gameplay does become
08:09 - too much it always feels like you can
08:11 - get better and beat your previous score
08:13 - a Hallmark of a good arcade game so on
08:17 - to the next genre this is the clicker
08:20 - game and although we had a number of
08:22 - submissions in this category only one
08:25 - made it into the short list and that was
08:27 - Johnny buns King of Cony Island by bits
08:31 - of code and what a classy game this is
08:34 - and it's a simple concept you are
08:36 - entering a Hot Dog Eating competition
08:38 - and have to eat as many hot dogs as
08:40 - possible within 2 minutes click the hot
08:42 - dog Button to eat a hot dog but spam it
08:45 - too fast and you start to get
08:47 - indigestion that slows you down faster
08:50 - still and he turns an unfortunate shade
08:52 - of blue but quickly drink some liquids
08:55 - and you can get back into the game again
08:57 - the trick is finding that perfect
08:58 - balance and and stuffing in just way too
09:01 - much that is healthy for sure but it's
09:04 - mighty gratifying when you get into the
09:05 - swing of it anyhow want to challenge my
09:08 - top
09:08 - 247 high score go on I dare you so yeah
09:13 - this is a masterfully engineered game
09:16 - and hold on what you're a coding coach
09:19 - well of course you are oh gosh well
09:22 - excellent game and keep up the good work
09:24 - you win this category the next category
09:27 - I'll call the dodging games there was
09:30 - some Fierce competition in this genre
09:32 - but I managed to whittle it down to just
09:34 - three so here they are don't die by
09:37 - Strider
09:39 - 2013 they have a very pleasant title
09:41 - screen love the button animation here
09:44 - and this is a classic example of this
09:45 - type of game we are keyboard controlled
09:48 - which limits movement speed and it has a
09:50 - catchy tune and the game Begins the
09:52 - important thing is that we are given a
09:55 - heads up to each impeding death scenario
09:57 - hopefully just enough to hour to get out
09:59 - of the way in time the colors are all
10:02 - very nice as is the costume based HP
10:04 - counter the only problem I have is that
10:06 - things do get a bit out of hand quite
10:09 - quickly and there are some useful Health
10:12 - pickups to keep us going surprisingly
10:13 - long but man I do find I almost always
10:16 - lose HP trying to reach them great job
10:19 - though a very good game next up we have
10:22 - two many projectiles by word four this
10:26 - is a similar concept to don't die but
10:28 - with a very very different feel for
10:30 - starters it has less of a party feel
10:33 - almost feeling relaxed but with an odd
10:36 - tension the build up of difficulty is
10:38 - also nice and gradual so it gives you
10:41 - time to really get into this game
10:43 - interestingly the player movement simply
10:45 - follows the mouse this means we can move
10:47 - very precisely yet with great speed if
10:50 - required it's a fun choice and it works
10:53 - well as more and more ways of enemies
10:54 - are introduced to compound our problems
10:57 - each with their own shape light p and
10:59 - behavior to be mastered when this all
11:02 - comes together it really does become too
11:05 - much the question is just how long you
11:07 - can keep going what I love about this
11:09 - one is that you really feel the
11:11 - progression towards the inevitable and
11:13 - yet with skill you may be surprised just
11:15 - how long you can keep things up Okay the
11:18 - third out of three undertale the
11:20 - infinite void by ows 11 this one needs
11:25 - no introduction an undertale boss battle
11:28 - no less and I can can tell you a lot of
11:30 - work has gone into this one be that from
11:32 - the awesomely animated character rig to
11:34 - the very sweet text Engine with
11:35 - appropriately witty dialogue to the
11:37 - crazy difficult everchanging battle
11:40 - sequences prepare to spend a good 10
11:42 - minutes blazing through this epic demo
11:45 - what I can say is unless you are some
11:46 - kind of undertale battle Pro you don't
11:49 - stand a chance of getting very far the
11:52 - only reason I could see the game out was
11:54 - that ow rs1 made the space key reset
11:57 - your health ha very handy and I'm
12:00 - pleased they did because I enjoyed each
12:02 - fight sequence just to see how things
12:04 - played out after stage 11 the game kind
12:07 - of resets I believe and after I got to
12:09 - 19 the whole thing ground to a halt even
12:12 - so it was a very good entry and a very
12:14 - fine demo of what they are capable of
12:17 - well done you but we have to choose a
12:20 - winner and from these three it was dead
12:23 - hard but in the end I had to go with too
12:26 - many projectiles by water for just
12:28 - cutting ahead of the batch for making a
12:30 - game with great progression requiring
12:32 - skill to advance even in the face of
12:34 - becoming too much so shall we progress
12:37 - on to our platformer games let's see how
12:40 - our contributors envisaged just too much
12:43 - in this genre scratch platformer by JP
12:47 - Calas Pro and what the heck is going on
12:51 - in this platformer why am I surrounded
12:53 - by Space Dogs the level is just so busy
12:55 - and full of stuff going on so it's so
12:57 - hard to know what to do what's more you
13:00 - don't have time to hang around because
13:02 - this rising sea of lava will make short
13:04 - work of you and there's simply No Escape
13:07 - I can't quite figure out if I hit a bug
13:09 - or whether it's a feature but I seem to
13:11 - get stuck in the ceiling and fly across
13:12 - the screen not that it helped me at all
13:15 - and I was soon very much out of lives I
13:18 - can't quite say that I enjoyed playing
13:20 - this crazy chaotic platform but it sure
13:23 - fits the bill of being too much after
13:26 - that we are sure to need some relief and
13:28 - we certainly get that with the immensely
13:30 - Pleasant adventure of Mr Jack by um I
13:36 - all ran
13:38 - namaru well I never knew how badly I
13:41 - wanted to be a bright colorful bird
13:43 - until I got to try it out in this
13:44 - wonderfully creative take on the classic
13:46 - platformer and man I just love how the
13:49 - level has been put together each screen
13:51 - joining to the next to form a large
13:53 - colorful world that Mr Jack inhabits and
13:56 - he has a mission to collect all the
13:57 - fruits and keys open this door at the
14:00 - top of the world I wonder what's inside
14:03 - is this game too cute too delightful too
14:06 - too colorful I'm not sure but it was
14:09 - certainly fun playing it so thank you
14:11 - for your submission and then we move
14:14 - from the bright colorful world of Mr
14:15 - Jack to the dark Eerie world of the
14:19 - cavern of the shifting Shadows by
14:23 - pbne and that's a good way to describe
14:27 - what this game is in general Eerie the
14:30 - whole world is Shifting and moving
14:32 - appearing and disappearing can we
14:34 - navigate our way through this crazy Cave
14:36 - System avoiding spikes traps Falling
14:39 - Rocks or getting crushed by the moving
14:41 - platforms themselves as we progress
14:43 - there are various intriguing powerups
14:45 - that can leave you inverted playing
14:47 - upside down or simply slow the scrolling
14:49 - of the game it's a nice aesthetic and it
14:52 - does play well into the theme of just
14:54 - too much with all the movement and
14:55 - threat around every corner I do wish
14:58 - there was perhaps a progress indicator
15:00 - or
15:02 - score Sonic's fruit Mania by sparkster
15:07 - 1993 well what do we have here a Sonic
15:10 - fan no less and this really is rather a
15:12 - good attempt at the basic Sonic game I'm
15:15 - very impressed with the inclusion of
15:16 - well animated cutscenes and dialogue
15:19 - into the main platform of gameplay so Dr
15:22 - Eggman has stolen the seven Chaos
15:23 - Emeralds and the job of retrieving them
15:25 - is just too much for Sonic to do alone
15:28 - mhm I think we are again stepping
15:30 - slightly outside of what is permissible
15:32 - as a game Jam submission here anyhow
15:36 - it's a very wellp put together project
15:38 - I'd love to see some classic Sonic moves
15:40 - like some anti-gravity speedrunning but
15:42 - yeah I know it's super hard to get right
15:44 - maybe I can make a tutorial on that one
15:46 - day but it's now time to pick a winner
15:50 - and it's the cavern of the shifting
15:52 - Shadows by Pine 0000 because of its just
15:56 - two Eerie shifting changing levels that
15:58 - are both challenging but simple in
16:00 - design not overwhelming the player with
16:02 - crazy visuals but maximizing on its
16:05 - theme well done Pine 0000 I hope you
16:08 - continue to develop your game now
16:11 - everyone loves a good puzzle and we've
16:13 - got three hot listed entries up for the
16:15 - challenge our first entry is too much
16:18 - Party People by Leo games 20 a
16:20 - delightfully simple puzzle where we are
16:23 - at a party and we must click on all the
16:24 - people who do not have white hats well I
16:27 - think I can manage that oh well okay
16:30 - they really are mingled together just
16:32 - the colored hats colored hats colored
16:34 - hats and it seems that new party members
16:36 - are arriving all the time oh no now a
16:39 - bit of a problem we have is that some of
16:41 - the people we need to click on get
16:42 - unfairly positioned behind other people
16:45 - it would be nice to find a way to get
16:46 - around that what I really do like though
16:49 - is that each time you play the game you
16:51 - get a different rule to look out for be
16:53 - that eye colors or hat colors yeah
16:56 - really nice next up bubble carrots by
16:59 - ear the cool guy this puzzle game
17:02 - requires us to battle the clock to
17:04 - collect as many tasty treats as possible
17:06 - in 2 minutes the trick is that we can
17:08 - only move to Red neighboring squares
17:11 - Brown squares are walls and orange
17:13 - squares well they are game over that's
17:16 - the rules and although it sounds simple
17:19 - it's amazingly easy to get it wrong when
17:21 - the treat you are after is right there
17:23 - next to you and the timer is ticking
17:24 - away I do very much like this game and
17:27 - it's a clever idea with great execution
17:29 - but is it too much so that brings us to
17:33 - speed search by not a school account
17:37 - right away I can see that they've made
17:38 - good use of my Sprite layering tutorial
17:40 - to keep their Sprite ordering in check
17:43 - good job so here we go it's a Race
17:46 - Against Time in this game to follow the
17:48 - instructions given in each round be that
17:51 - to find a cup or to find two matching
17:53 - items or the fastest moving item in the
17:56 - scene and man sometimes times especially
17:59 - on the two matching items it can be
18:01 - surprisingly difficult dare I say just
18:04 - too much I really like the presentation
18:07 - of this game and it cleverly gets around
18:09 - any issues preventing the clicking of
18:10 - items by keeping them moving sorting
18:13 - them from back to front and slowing
18:15 - their motion down when the mouse hovers
18:16 - over them all in all a really wonderful
18:19 - entertaining game so the winner of this
18:23 - just too much puzzle category is speed
18:26 - search by not a school account for
18:28 - polished Graphics solid coding and
18:30 - wellth thought out game mechanics that
18:32 - sit well in the just too much theme are
18:35 - very well done to you and that brings us
18:38 - to the final game genre the classic
18:41 - shooter game although it crosses over a
18:43 - bit with our arcade game category these
18:46 - four next entries differ in that the
18:48 - player can more freely move around the
18:50 - level and fire in any direction so first
18:53 - up the unpixel by weird stuff 123 it's a
18:57 - fine example of this category where you
18:59 - take on the role of a Fearless cube in a
19:01 - world infested with the evil unpixel
19:04 - luckily you are armed with a handy gun
19:06 - that as you progress is upgradeable to
19:08 - help you tackle wave upon wave of ever
19:10 - more dangerous enemies now the upgrades
19:13 - are not only limited to your gun but
19:15 - also boost your speed almost insanely so
19:18 - and you'll find some very much needed
19:19 - Health drops too question is just how
19:23 - long can you keep the balance in your
19:24 - favor I just wish there was some kind of
19:26 - score visible so that you could tell
19:28 - tell how well you did guys you should
19:31 - always include a score next up it's too
19:34 - many gurgles version zero by B danger
19:37 - fish what an awesome title this game
19:40 - looks suspiciously familiar yes it's a
19:43 - great reworking of lemonides we get
19:45 - thrown into a frantic battle against our
19:48 - enemy the gurgles luckily we have a
19:51 - seemingly infinite supply of potatoes to
19:53 - fire back at them and they certainly
19:55 - didn't see that coming and they are
19:57 - surprisingly effective
19:59 - what I particularly like is that the
20:01 - game is set to music which SNS
20:03 - beautifully with the stages of the game
20:05 - dividing it into levels each harder than
20:07 - the last but finally being described as
20:10 - way too much and gosh it certainly feels
20:13 - that way but shock I was able to
20:16 - complete this one was I lucky I'm not
20:18 - sure but it certainly felt like a great
20:21 - achievement next up deserted by mangoes
20:25 - Django it's a very attractive single
20:27 - screen shooter set in a desert where you
20:29 - take on the role of um yeah this little
20:32 - guy now the level is a dangerous place
20:35 - where you must avoid wandering snakes
20:37 - and battle the incoming cacti creatures
20:39 - and this is where the game shines
20:41 - because the cacti are definitely using
20:43 - real pathfinding did you watch my
20:45 - tutorial on that and it works great here
20:48 - but also your projectiles are bouncing
20:50 - projectiles which makes the whole game
20:51 - exceptionally fun once you dispatch a
20:54 - cactus go out and collect their Mana
20:56 - it's just a shame that after a while
20:58 - while of play the game does tend to bug
21:00 - out especially on the second level I
21:03 - suspect it's down to the screen Shake
21:05 - causing problems with Collision
21:06 - detection I'm sure if it got fixed this
21:08 - game would be an absolute Gem and that
21:11 - leaves us with tale of the sidethe
21:13 - bearer by DJ Wacko and oh my was this an
21:18 - unexpected treat DJ wacko did a great
21:20 - job with the coding and I have to give a
21:22 - shout out to ultra catty for the crazy
21:25 - awesome art what a sensational collab
21:28 - the game begins with a simple tutorial
21:30 - where we learn how to move around
21:32 - teleporting being your thing for fast
21:34 - travel then clicking your mouse calls
21:37 - down purple Blast From Heaven you don't
21:39 - have a lot of range but they will be
21:41 - very effective against your foes and
21:43 - these little crates once you've
21:45 - collected enough of these green energy
21:46 - balls you can engage your special
21:48 - ability and call forth four awesome Mega
21:51 - blasts that I would expect to scare away
21:53 - anything silly enough to consider coming
21:55 - up against us and things do start nice
21:58 - and easy these small energy blasts have
22:00 - enough knock back that they can stop the
22:02 - enemies in their tracks and leave you to
22:04 - collect your well-deserved Mana but it's
22:06 - not long before the levels ramp up in
22:08 - difficulty and things start to get out
22:10 - of hand but even so these awesome energy
22:13 - blasts turn out very handy as expected
22:16 - and I didn't find it too difficult to
22:17 - reach the end of this game man I wish it
22:21 - could be so much longer are you planning
22:23 - on continuing this gosh so good but guys
22:27 - do you think this game embodies a theme
22:29 - of just too much tricky well picking a
22:33 - winner is a mix of asking how well the
22:36 - game embodies the theme and how fun it
22:38 - is to play and so I'm going to have to
22:40 - say the winner in this shooting category
22:42 - is too many gurgles by be danger fish
22:46 - for such an intense yet structured
22:48 - battle and although it is set against an
22:50 - unfathomable number of enemies still
22:52 - provides a rout to success
22:56 - congratulations and so yes I did say
22:59 - that that was the last category but I do
23:02 - want to give out one last special award
23:04 - for the most impressive submission and
23:07 - out of all the projects I played this
23:09 - has to go to JD wacko for the tale of
23:12 - the side Bearer it may have come second
23:14 - for the title of just too much but it is
23:16 - an absolutely gorgeous looking game with
23:19 - so much potential and I would love to
23:22 - play more of it so well done you and

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers we recently ran our first game Jam within the Griff patch Academy and wow was it a blast the theme was just too much which was wide open to interpretation and so we had over 150 entries ranging from Platformers to puzzlers to animations and yes I played them all and now for your viewing pleasure I will present my top 22 shortlisted projects and pick eight winners across the seven different game genre as you know scratch has a thriving community of animators and their submissions were simply hilarious many projects played with the theme of too much whether that was too much work or too many potatoes or too many ideas but two projects stood out for their Ingenuity quality control by FR wolf UB follows a story of a mad cat scientist and their super duper quality computer TM problem is it requires all the power from the New York City Power Plant to run it and that turns out to be just too much and so this clever Choose Your Own Adventure begins having found yourself dropped into some strange distant land and with an amusing drop in the visual production quality the First Choice intriguingly bids you to enter a time machine and so now having to click the green flag yet again to start the game strangely things are not the same unfortunately a Time Paradox kicks in and the game ends but this is by no means the only ending nope there are 11 of them can you find them all I really appreciate the effort that went into drawing the animations and a cinematic framing of each shot the text engine is also great but perhaps a way to skip through some of the dialogue and scenes even faster would be a bonus but I'm nitpicking here so yeah very cool indeed up against this we have our second animation just to much ideas by Binky Beaver uh Idea Idea Idea like a number of entries this animation focused on the concept of coming up with an idea however this time the protagonist stumbles across the Griff patch Academy which in turn ignites their brain with too much ideas I see what you did there so they get down to it to making a project and then surprise surprise you actually get to play the game right in the middle of the animation that's really quite unique and I love it just a little warning it turns out that too many ideas outside of the Griff patch Academy can lead to hospitalization due to brain overload just thought I'd warn you like with a number of other animation entries Binky Beaver went to the trouble of voice acting their characters which is always Really Brave and can be really difficult so yeah they did a great job ooh so picking a category winner both of these shortlisted projects went above and beyond but I'm going to have to go with quality control troll very cool and well done so our next game submissions are those that fall into the arcade genre and we had a lot of these so I had to split them roughly between General arcade and all round directional Shooters so arcade games these tend to be all about fast level progression upgrades and yes high scores and I've got five shortlisted entries to show you starting with just to Dango by mnnnn 3344 the kingdom of cringle Mary is under attack by the infamous Dango horde it is up to us to take on the role of the honorable Knight and fight through these delicious bouncing desserts once you get the hang of the first wave you quickly find that things only get harder from there it's really just one big multistage boss battle and we all love boss battles and gosh once you reach the big guy himself it's just too much for me but the repetitive nature of each stage and gradually increasing difficulty lends well to the feeling that with practice you can progress further and faster you just need to figure out your strategy and stick with it it's wellcoded looks great and it's a blast to play is it too much well let's see the competition just too much advertisements by Malo and Ouija and I just love this idea and don't we all hate ads thank goodness there aren't any ads in my videos within the Griff patch Academy anyhow this game is essentially a simplified Flappy Bird Style game the catch being you have to also fend off all the popup ads that are vying for your attention and man the game would be hard enough without this distraction and it quickly becomes all too much very clever and perhaps just a little too real since sometimes you can't even reach those close buttons since they appear off the screen I think perhaps it would be more fun if there was some kind of difficulty progression starting a bit easier but the concept is very entertaining just too much blocks by Bluey bat games and apparently this game has the best death animation ever if they don't say so themselves well I guess we'll see wow what a Polish Game this is the UI is great with lovely transitions this arcade game is simple you take control of this little white dude who must fend off the incoming enemy cubes by dashing at them with a click of the mouse the early levels are quite relaxed but jumping into level two things really heat up and yes that is a cool death animation nice one entering level three well the game gets quite challenging as there really are just too much blocks but I do enjoy the addition of the large explosive blocks that help you to clear the screen of enemies fast that brings a touch of strategy to the game which is a really nice touch the next project is named switch by Swift now this has a much more laidback feel to it a unique Twist on the the repetitive vertical shooter where you take control of two individual turrets each guarding their half of the screen the catch is that only one turret can move at once so while one is cycling back and forward dealing death to a wide area the other turret is focused on a single point of course a simple click of the mouse reverses his behavior so we can defend the entire playing field where this mechanic really starts to get interesting is when the larger boss enemies show up these monstrosities require a prolonged bombardment of bullets to clear them from the screen so now things get a lot harder to manage in general I really love this idea it's fun to play but it could be even better if we had more gratifying feedback as our bullets bounced off the enemies some kind of particle effects explosions sounds or screen Shake perhaps and once you play for a while suddenly you get into situations that are simply impossible to beat which is a little frustrating now the last in this category Diamond bouncer by dxr TC SSH now this is a very intriguing project it's ridiculously simple bounce a diamond off your paddle to revent it going off the bottom of the screen yes we've seen it all before right well not in this too much flavor because now with every bounce we get double yes double the number of diamonds so how on Earth are we expected to cope with this well your guess is as good as mine all I can say is seeing that high score of 30 drives me to keep playing it's tantalizing to think that somehow you could be the one to get lucky and get that top high score and I think I got pretty good with 13 man is it really possible to get them all I don't know but it drives me mad awesome game and yeah it's just too much okay guys they were our five arcade submissions and what a difficult choice is since they are all so good for different reasons at the end of the day I'm going to have to choose just too much blocks by Bluey bat games for their superb presentation and excellent gameplay what swung it for me was although the gameplay does become too much it always feels like you can get better and beat your previous score a Hallmark of a good arcade game so on to the next genre this is the clicker game and although we had a number of submissions in this category only one made it into the short list and that was Johnny buns King of Cony Island by bits of code and what a classy game this is and it's a simple concept you are entering a Hot Dog Eating competition and have to eat as many hot dogs as possible within 2 minutes click the hot dog Button to eat a hot dog but spam it too fast and you start to get indigestion that slows you down faster still and he turns an unfortunate shade of blue but quickly drink some liquids and you can get back into the game again the trick is finding that perfect balance and and stuffing in just way too much that is healthy for sure but it's mighty gratifying when you get into the swing of it anyhow want to challenge my top 247 high score go on I dare you so yeah this is a masterfully engineered game and hold on what you're a coding coach well of course you are oh gosh well excellent game and keep up the good work you win this category the next category I'll call the dodging games there was some Fierce competition in this genre but I managed to whittle it down to just three so here they are don't die by Strider 2013 they have a very pleasant title screen love the button animation here and this is a classic example of this type of game we are keyboard controlled which limits movement speed and it has a catchy tune and the game Begins the important thing is that we are given a heads up to each impeding death scenario hopefully just enough to hour to get out of the way in time the colors are all very nice as is the costume based HP counter the only problem I have is that things do get a bit out of hand quite quickly and there are some useful Health pickups to keep us going surprisingly long but man I do find I almost always lose HP trying to reach them great job though a very good game next up we have two many projectiles by word four this is a similar concept to don't die but with a very very different feel for starters it has less of a party feel almost feeling relaxed but with an odd tension the build up of difficulty is also nice and gradual so it gives you time to really get into this game interestingly the player movement simply follows the mouse this means we can move very precisely yet with great speed if required it's a fun choice and it works well as more and more ways of enemies are introduced to compound our problems each with their own shape light p and behavior to be mastered when this all comes together it really does become too much the question is just how long you can keep going what I love about this one is that you really feel the progression towards the inevitable and yet with skill you may be surprised just how long you can keep things up Okay the third out of three undertale the infinite void by ows 11 this one needs no introduction an undertale boss battle no less and I can can tell you a lot of work has gone into this one be that from the awesomely animated character rig to the very sweet text Engine with appropriately witty dialogue to the crazy difficult everchanging battle sequences prepare to spend a good 10 minutes blazing through this epic demo what I can say is unless you are some kind of undertale battle Pro you don't stand a chance of getting very far the only reason I could see the game out was that ow rs1 made the space key reset your health ha very handy and I'm pleased they did because I enjoyed each fight sequence just to see how things played out after stage 11 the game kind of resets I believe and after I got to 19 the whole thing ground to a halt even so it was a very good entry and a very fine demo of what they are capable of well done you but we have to choose a winner and from these three it was dead hard but in the end I had to go with too many projectiles by water for just cutting ahead of the batch for making a game with great progression requiring skill to advance even in the face of becoming too much so shall we progress on to our platformer games let's see how our contributors envisaged just too much in this genre scratch platformer by JP Calas Pro and what the heck is going on in this platformer why am I surrounded by Space Dogs the level is just so busy and full of stuff going on so it's so hard to know what to do what's more you don't have time to hang around because this rising sea of lava will make short work of you and there's simply No Escape I can't quite figure out if I hit a bug or whether it's a feature but I seem to get stuck in the ceiling and fly across the screen not that it helped me at all and I was soon very much out of lives I can't quite say that I enjoyed playing this crazy chaotic platform but it sure fits the bill of being too much after that we are sure to need some relief and we certainly get that with the immensely Pleasant adventure of Mr Jack by um I all ran namaru well I never knew how badly I wanted to be a bright colorful bird until I got to try it out in this wonderfully creative take on the classic platformer and man I just love how the level has been put together each screen joining to the next to form a large colorful world that Mr Jack inhabits and he has a mission to collect all the fruits and keys open this door at the top of the world I wonder what's inside is this game too cute too delightful too too colorful I'm not sure but it was certainly fun playing it so thank you for your submission and then we move from the bright colorful world of Mr Jack to the dark Eerie world of the cavern of the shifting Shadows by pbne and that's a good way to describe what this game is in general Eerie the whole world is Shifting and moving appearing and disappearing can we navigate our way through this crazy Cave System avoiding spikes traps Falling Rocks or getting crushed by the moving platforms themselves as we progress there are various intriguing powerups that can leave you inverted playing upside down or simply slow the scrolling of the game it's a nice aesthetic and it does play well into the theme of just too much with all the movement and threat around every corner I do wish there was perhaps a progress indicator or score Sonic's fruit Mania by sparkster 1993 well what do we have here a Sonic fan no less and this really is rather a good attempt at the basic Sonic game I'm very impressed with the inclusion of well animated cutscenes and dialogue into the main platform of gameplay so Dr Eggman has stolen the seven Chaos Emeralds and the job of retrieving them is just too much for Sonic to do alone mhm I think we are again stepping slightly outside of what is permissible as a game Jam submission here anyhow it's a very wellp put together project I'd love to see some classic Sonic moves like some antigravity speedrunning but yeah I know it's super hard to get right maybe I can make a tutorial on that one day but it's now time to pick a winner and it's the cavern of the shifting Shadows by Pine 0000 because of its just two Eerie shifting changing levels that are both challenging but simple in design not overwhelming the player with crazy visuals but maximizing on its theme well done Pine 0000 I hope you continue to develop your game now everyone loves a good puzzle and we've got three hot listed entries up for the challenge our first entry is too much Party People by Leo games 20 a delightfully simple puzzle where we are at a party and we must click on all the people who do not have white hats well I think I can manage that oh well okay they really are mingled together just the colored hats colored hats colored hats and it seems that new party members are arriving all the time oh no now a bit of a problem we have is that some of the people we need to click on get unfairly positioned behind other people it would be nice to find a way to get around that what I really do like though is that each time you play the game you get a different rule to look out for be that eye colors or hat colors yeah really nice next up bubble carrots by ear the cool guy this puzzle game requires us to battle the clock to collect as many tasty treats as possible in 2 minutes the trick is that we can only move to Red neighboring squares Brown squares are walls and orange squares well they are game over that's the rules and although it sounds simple it's amazingly easy to get it wrong when the treat you are after is right there next to you and the timer is ticking away I do very much like this game and it's a clever idea with great execution but is it too much so that brings us to speed search by not a school account right away I can see that they've made good use of my Sprite layering tutorial to keep their Sprite ordering in check good job so here we go it's a Race Against Time in this game to follow the instructions given in each round be that to find a cup or to find two matching items or the fastest moving item in the scene and man sometimes times especially on the two matching items it can be surprisingly difficult dare I say just too much I really like the presentation of this game and it cleverly gets around any issues preventing the clicking of items by keeping them moving sorting them from back to front and slowing their motion down when the mouse hovers over them all in all a really wonderful entertaining game so the winner of this just too much puzzle category is speed search by not a school account for polished Graphics solid coding and wellth thought out game mechanics that sit well in the just too much theme are very well done to you and that brings us to the final game genre the classic shooter game although it crosses over a bit with our arcade game category these four next entries differ in that the player can more freely move around the level and fire in any direction so first up the unpixel by weird stuff 123 it's a fine example of this category where you take on the role of a Fearless cube in a world infested with the evil unpixel luckily you are armed with a handy gun that as you progress is upgradeable to help you tackle wave upon wave of ever more dangerous enemies now the upgrades are not only limited to your gun but also boost your speed almost insanely so and you'll find some very much needed Health drops too question is just how long can you keep the balance in your favor I just wish there was some kind of score visible so that you could tell tell how well you did guys you should always include a score next up it's too many gurgles version zero by B danger fish what an awesome title this game looks suspiciously familiar yes it's a great reworking of lemonides we get thrown into a frantic battle against our enemy the gurgles luckily we have a seemingly infinite supply of potatoes to fire back at them and they certainly didn't see that coming and they are surprisingly effective what I particularly like is that the game is set to music which SNS beautifully with the stages of the game dividing it into levels each harder than the last but finally being described as way too much and gosh it certainly feels that way but shock I was able to complete this one was I lucky I'm not sure but it certainly felt like a great achievement next up deserted by mangoes Django it's a very attractive single screen shooter set in a desert where you take on the role of um yeah this little guy now the level is a dangerous place where you must avoid wandering snakes and battle the incoming cacti creatures and this is where the game shines because the cacti are definitely using real pathfinding did you watch my tutorial on that and it works great here but also your projectiles are bouncing projectiles which makes the whole game exceptionally fun once you dispatch a cactus go out and collect their Mana it's just a shame that after a while while of play the game does tend to bug out especially on the second level I suspect it's down to the screen Shake causing problems with Collision detection I'm sure if it got fixed this game would be an absolute Gem and that leaves us with tale of the sidethe bearer by DJ Wacko and oh my was this an unexpected treat DJ wacko did a great job with the coding and I have to give a shout out to ultra catty for the crazy awesome art what a sensational collab the game begins with a simple tutorial where we learn how to move around teleporting being your thing for fast travel then clicking your mouse calls down purple Blast From Heaven you don't have a lot of range but they will be very effective against your foes and these little crates once you've collected enough of these green energy balls you can engage your special ability and call forth four awesome Mega blasts that I would expect to scare away anything silly enough to consider coming up against us and things do start nice and easy these small energy blasts have enough knock back that they can stop the enemies in their tracks and leave you to collect your welldeserved Mana but it's not long before the levels ramp up in difficulty and things start to get out of hand but even so these awesome energy blasts turn out very handy as expected and I didn't find it too difficult to reach the end of this game man I wish it could be so much longer are you planning on continuing this gosh so good but guys do you think this game embodies a theme of just too much tricky well picking a winner is a mix of asking how well the game embodies the theme and how fun it is to play and so I'm going to have to say the winner in this shooting category is too many gurgles by be danger fish for such an intense yet structured battle and although it is set against an unfathomable number of enemies still provides a rout to success congratulations and so yes I did say that that was the last category but I do want to give out one last special award for the most impressive submission and out of all the projects I played this has to go to JD wacko for the tale of the side Bearer it may have come second for the title of just too much but it is an absolutely gorgeous looking game with so much potential and I would love to play more of it so well done you and Well Done everyone who submitted an entry you all did so well and it was a pleasure getting to play your games there's a link to all the projects mentioned and the winners under this video so do check them out and I cannot wait to see what you guys in the gri patch Academy make for next month's game Jam challenge until then scratch on guys
