00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers
00:04 - and boom what is Geometry Dash without
00:07 - an epic end of game explosion I'm Griff
00:11 - batch and in this fourth episode of our
00:13 - series we'll be recreating this effect
00:15 - just as you see it here and guys it
00:18 - looks awesome doesn't it sit tight and
00:20 - I'll show you exactly how it's made now
00:23 - these videos do take me a lot of time to
00:26 - put together so I'm trying something a
00:28 - little different in an effort to get new
00:30 - videos out weekly I'm going to try to
00:32 - keep my episodes short and on topic if
00:35 - you like this idea then please take a
00:36 - moment to drop me a like and I'll also
00:38 - watch out for your comments under the
00:40 - video so without further Ado we'll get
00:43 - right to it open your projects from
00:45 - episode 3 and as always we're going to
00:47 - save them as a fresh due copy for this
00:50 - is episode four guys let's get
00:54 - scratching
00:55 - and I can hardly believe this but the
00:58 - first thing to note about modern
01:00 - Geometry Dash is that when the player
01:02 - dies the level instantly grinds to a
01:04 - halt what and to think that we spent all
01:07 - that effort to bring it to a nice
01:09 - gradual stop oh well it was a fun lesson
01:13 - learned but let's take it out in the
01:16 - player Sprite now scroll down to the
01:18 - when I receive game over script then
01:21 - right before the repeat Loop simply set
01:23 - scroll speed to zero yes a complete stop
01:28 - and then pull out that change scroll
01:30 - speed from the loop so that it no longer
01:33 - applies
01:34 - now is that all we need to change let's
01:36 - take a look
01:37 - ah so dying to spikes ah that looked a
01:41 - little odd the player appears to jump to
01:43 - the right and I did expect that because
01:46 - scrolling up to the game on scripts we
01:49 - have this little change X block here or
01:52 - when we touch a spike now this needs to
01:54 - go so carefully remove it but keep those
01:57 - other two broadcast and stop blocks
01:59 - below
02:00 - here we go smash that green flag and now
02:04 - we have a much tidier instance stop I'm
02:08 - testing on a wall Collision here it
02:10 - comes yep that too is working fine
02:13 - Splendid then we can move on to creating
02:16 - the first part of the explosion effect
02:18 - the expanding Circle
02:22 - we'll Begin by creating a new Sprite
02:25 - naming it explode
02:29 - the color of this circle is going to be
02:32 - the same cyan blue we used in the
02:34 - particle Sprite and we get the color
02:37 - using the selection tool and simply
02:39 - selecting the particle shape there we go
02:42 - now moving back into our new Sprite The
02:45 - Fill color is retained so we'll draw a
02:47 - circle don't forget to hold down the
02:49 - shift key to keep it perfectly circular
02:52 - and we're aiming for a size of 100 by
02:55 - 100 pixels a little adjusting and there
03:00 - we go
03:01 - lastly snap the shape to the center of
03:03 - the canvas and we are good to get coding
03:06 - when green flag clicked we'll do some
03:10 - setup initially we'll hide the explosion
03:14 - gone the next time it shows is when we
03:17 - receive the game over message
03:20 - so bring that in
03:22 - and immediately show the Sprite again
03:27 - now obviously this should be positioned
03:30 - over the player go to player
03:36 - nice but a bit too large for starters so
03:39 - set size two
03:42 - twenty percent that's the setup now for
03:46 - the animation
03:48 - repeat and ten times
03:51 - and we're going to change size by to
03:53 - make it grow and leaving it at 10 for
03:56 - now
03:56 - then we'll click the game over script to
04:00 - test it
04:01 - okay nice I'm liking this but let's make
04:04 - it grow for longer up the repeat to 15
04:08 - frames
04:10 - cool but as the circle expands we want
04:13 - it to fade away too we do that with a
04:17 - change ghost effect and for full Fade
04:20 - Out that's 100 over 15 frames that
04:24 - should be 100 divided by 15 roughly
04:26 - seven each time
04:28 - smash that game over script and that
04:31 - looked good let's see it again
04:33 - oh purple scratch cats did we break it
04:37 - no no we just forgot to reset the ghost
04:40 - effect to make it visible again the
04:42 - second time around drop in a simple
04:44 - clear graphic effects and yes we are
04:47 - back in business now this short is cool
04:50 - but I have one more enhancement to make
04:52 - the circle currently expands at a
04:55 - constant linear rate but it would look
04:58 - even better if instead its expansion
05:01 - slowed down over time this is called
05:04 - easing out
05:06 - so rather than changing size by 10 each
05:09 - frame we calculate the easing figure
05:11 - using a subtract block starting with a
05:14 - hundred and seventy percent that's the
05:16 - maximum size we are aiming to expand our
05:19 - Circle to from this we subtract the
05:22 - current size of the explosion Sprite
05:24 - that gives us the amount left we need to
05:27 - increase by that's nothing if we've
05:29 - already reached our Target size
05:31 - and now we divide
05:34 - dividing the amount left to increase by
05:36 - by nine
05:38 - now the larger this number is the longer
05:41 - it will take for the shape to reach its
05:43 - final size
05:44 - right exciting hit that game over script
05:48 - oh yeah that's what I'm talking about
05:51 - the new easing out gives it that
05:53 - professional touch right
05:55 - now just before we move on I think it
05:57 - best to drop in a hide block at the end
05:59 - I just feel better knowing that the
06:01 - Sprite is not hanging around on screen
06:03 - even if it is ghosted to nothing
06:06 - great time to see this fully in game
06:09 - smash that green flag
06:11 - perfect that's just as I hoped it's
06:14 - looking better and better except my OCD
06:18 - simply cannot take this anymore does
06:20 - anyone else notice that oh so tiny but
06:23 - highly annoying step down in the level
06:25 - as the player moves from Level costume
06:27 - number one to costume two ah man I hate
06:30 - it and it does seem strange because the
06:33 - ground is an exact duplicate between
06:35 - costumes one and two they should line up
06:37 - perfectly well not to worry if you want
06:40 - to fix it you can just drop in another
06:42 - rectangle at the top of our levels again
06:44 - out of sight and that alone is enough to
06:46 - fix my first screen crazy and you may
06:50 - need to add them to more than one just
06:52 - see how you go phew now I can move on
06:56 - the next stage of our explosion is to
06:59 - add in those particles the particle
07:01 - burst now this is what really brings the
07:04 - whole animation together particles begin
07:06 - at the center of the player and then
07:08 - spread outwards in a circle
07:11 - now we already added the particle Sprite
07:13 - and that was used to create the trail
07:15 - behind the player however we won't try
07:17 - to reuse it instead right click or long
07:20 - press on mobile and duplicate the
07:23 - particles Sprite
07:25 - this time we'll name it explode
07:27 - particles or perhaps particle burst if
07:30 - you prefer
07:31 - okay the costume can stay exactly the
07:34 - same click into the coding tab
07:37 - so unlike the particle Trail a particle
07:40 - burst must generate many clones all at
07:43 - once the trigger is once again from a
07:46 - game over event when I receive game over
07:49 - we want to create say 40 clones
07:51 - therefore repeat for 40. and create
07:55 - clone of myself
07:58 - the problem is this repeat Loop doesn't
08:00 - run instantly but will stagger the
08:02 - animation over 40 game frames to make it
08:06 - instant we need to make a new custom
08:08 - block
08:10 - boom and tick the run without screen
08:13 - refresh checkbox this will do the trick
08:17 - now all 40 clones will be created
08:19 - without waiting around excellent just
08:22 - drop the boom block under the game over
08:24 - receiver
08:26 - okay next up we want to code the
08:28 - particle's motion when I start as a
08:31 - clone now although the original particle
08:34 - scripts follow a similar pattern we'd be
08:36 - better to move them off and cherry pick
08:38 - the blocks we need
08:40 - the go to player that stays the same
08:43 - but we don't want to offset the position
08:45 - with the change X or Y blocks
08:48 - set size yeah we need that but up the
08:52 - picked sizes between 75 and 150 this
08:56 - time
08:57 - ah speed X and speed y so okay I'm going
09:01 - to switch to use a direction and speed
09:03 - this time around so drop in a point in
09:07 - Direction block and we'll pick a
09:09 - direction between negative 180 and 180.
09:12 - that's a full circle around the player
09:14 - and will help to form a circle of
09:16 - projectiles
09:18 - and now to set the speed
09:20 - so this should just read set speed not
09:23 - set speed X we can rename the variable
09:25 - speed X to Simply speed
09:30 - and then the speed y that can be deleted
09:34 - great bring that particle Sprite to the
09:37 - front go to front
09:40 - and reattach the remaining scripts the
09:43 - show repeat and delete blocks but we're
09:46 - going to pull out the movement scripts
09:47 - from the repeat these still assume a
09:49 - change X and Y approach to the movement
09:52 - instead our costume is already facing in
09:54 - the direction they want to move so all
09:56 - we need to do is move forwards by this
09:59 - particle's speed
10:01 - and then yeah we're going to fade them
10:03 - out using the change ghost block
10:06 - just a few more changes we'll up the
10:08 - repeat to 20 so that the particle burst
10:10 - lasts for a longer time and reduce the
10:13 - ghost effect down to four
10:15 - wow that was a lot of fiddling around I
10:19 - hope we will be suitably rewarded when
10:20 - we run these scripts to do so we're
10:23 - going to click on the when I receive
10:25 - game over hap lock just here
10:27 - and that is quite a cute little
10:30 - explosion but I can see a few issues
10:33 - firstly it's not half as big as I wanted
10:35 - and secondly the particle cubes are all
10:38 - rotated in the direction of travel we
10:41 - don't want this they should stay upright
10:43 - at all times and we can quickly fix that
10:46 - by clicking into the direction input and
10:48 - hitting the don't rotate option that's
10:51 - the third one across
10:53 - good that solves that one now for the
10:57 - power the speed we need to up the
10:59 - particle's initial speed let's try form
11:02 - three all the way up to 12. they should
11:05 - be quite fast
11:06 - click oh yes now that's more like it
11:10 - this particle burst is looking so much
11:12 - better for those small tweaks I've got
11:15 - to see this in game smash that green
11:17 - bunting
11:18 - oh marvelous it looks even better
11:21 - combined with the central circle too
11:23 - this is partly because of how the
11:25 - particles outpace the circle as the
11:27 - circle slows down with that easing we
11:30 - added now you might think we are done
11:33 - there and it's very close but I just
11:35 - have a couple of finishing touches to
11:37 - make firstly I'd like some particles to
11:40 - disappear faster than others so before
11:42 - the repeat Loop change ghost by a pick
11:45 - random
11:47 - between 0 and 30. that gives some
11:51 - particles a head start in fading away
11:54 - and then also we can make the particles
11:57 - shrink in size as they fade
12:00 - change size by negative three
12:04 - and now let's see this in action
12:07 - yeah it's coming along
12:10 - but the biggie is this in real Geometry
12:13 - Dash when particles overlap they change
12:17 - their color to become more white I love
12:19 - that and it's not so easy to replicate
12:22 - in scratch Faithfully but we can emulate
12:26 - it just a tat by setting the brightness
12:28 - effect before the repeat Loop to 100
12:32 - that's as bright as we can make it so
12:36 - now our particles appear white instead
12:39 - of blue
12:41 - and then we quickly fade back to Blue
12:44 - using a change brightness effect by
12:47 - negative 20. drop that into our repeat
12:50 - Loop
12:52 - except there is a problem with that the
12:54 - brightness quickly goes too far the
12:57 - other way and makes our particles black
12:59 - oh great
13:01 - no problem though we'll handle the
13:03 - brightness in our own script when I
13:06 - start as clone again
13:10 - repeat
13:11 - but only this time for five frames
13:15 - and in there we change the brightness by
13:18 - negative 20. and run the project
13:23 - great that fixed it getting too dark but
13:26 - the white effect is so quick I can
13:28 - hardly see it how about we hold it at
13:31 - White for a few extra frames we can do
13:34 - that with a weight before the repeat for
13:36 - three frames that's calculated as three
13:39 - thirtieths of a second that's 0.1
13:43 - seconds and that's it our particle
13:46 - explosion is complete and I'm really
13:48 - very happy with that all we need to do
13:51 - is Fade Out the player for the final
13:53 - effect so in the player Sprite
13:56 - scroll down to the game overscript and
13:59 - no surprises here change ghost effect by
14:04 - and we want this to be very quick so
14:06 - enter a value of 20.
14:09 - here goes nothing
14:11 - and wow all our hard work has paid off I
14:15 - don't think it could get a lot better
14:16 - looking than this what do you think did
14:18 - we miss anything let me know in the
14:21 - comments let's try a wall Collision
14:23 - oh boy that's really good and it sets us
14:27 - up nicely for the next episode where
14:29 - we're gonna ditch having to click that
14:31 - green flag to start the game so noob
14:33 - finally having the option to restart the
14:36 - level in game I'm looking forward to
14:38 - that and hey if you have a request for
14:40 - what we cover next then drop it in the
14:43 - comments under the video do remember to
14:45 - submit your projects to the official
14:46 - scratch Studio you'll find that linked
14:48 - under the video too and oh while you're
14:51 - still here please smash the like button
14:53 - and so is not to miss my next exciting
14:55 - video ensure you are subscribed to my
14:57 - channel and that the Bell icon is
14:59 - checked but alas that's all I've got
15:01 - time for today I hope you enjoyed the
15:03 - shorter format do let me know but until
15:06 - next time have a great week ahead and
15:09 - scratch on guys
15:12 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers and boom what is Geometry Dash without an epic end of game explosion I'm Griff batch and in this fourth episode of our series we'll be recreating this effect just as you see it here and guys it looks awesome doesn't it sit tight and I'll show you exactly how it's made now these videos do take me a lot of time to put together so I'm trying something a little different in an effort to get new videos out weekly I'm going to try to keep my episodes short and on topic if you like this idea then please take a moment to drop me a like and I'll also watch out for your comments under the video so without further Ado we'll get right to it open your projects from episode 3 and as always we're going to save them as a fresh due copy for this is episode four guys let's get scratching and I can hardly believe this but the first thing to note about modern Geometry Dash is that when the player dies the level instantly grinds to a halt what and to think that we spent all that effort to bring it to a nice gradual stop oh well it was a fun lesson learned but let's take it out in the player Sprite now scroll down to the when I receive game over script then right before the repeat Loop simply set scroll speed to zero yes a complete stop and then pull out that change scroll speed from the loop so that it no longer applies now is that all we need to change let's take a look ah so dying to spikes ah that looked a little odd the player appears to jump to the right and I did expect that because scrolling up to the game on scripts we have this little change X block here or when we touch a spike now this needs to go so carefully remove it but keep those other two broadcast and stop blocks below here we go smash that green flag and now we have a much tidier instance stop I'm testing on a wall Collision here it comes yep that too is working fine Splendid then we can move on to creating the first part of the explosion effect the expanding Circle we'll Begin by creating a new Sprite naming it explode the color of this circle is going to be the same cyan blue we used in the particle Sprite and we get the color using the selection tool and simply selecting the particle shape there we go now moving back into our new Sprite The Fill color is retained so we'll draw a circle don't forget to hold down the shift key to keep it perfectly circular and we're aiming for a size of 100 by 100 pixels a little adjusting and there we go lastly snap the shape to the center of the canvas and we are good to get coding when green flag clicked we'll do some setup initially we'll hide the explosion gone the next time it shows is when we receive the game over message so bring that in and immediately show the Sprite again now obviously this should be positioned over the player go to player nice but a bit too large for starters so set size two twenty percent that's the setup now for the animation repeat and ten times and we're going to change size by to make it grow and leaving it at 10 for now then we'll click the game over script to test it okay nice I'm liking this but let's make it grow for longer up the repeat to 15 frames cool but as the circle expands we want it to fade away too we do that with a change ghost effect and for full Fade Out that's 100 over 15 frames that should be 100 divided by 15 roughly seven each time smash that game over script and that looked good let's see it again oh purple scratch cats did we break it no no we just forgot to reset the ghost effect to make it visible again the second time around drop in a simple clear graphic effects and yes we are back in business now this short is cool but I have one more enhancement to make the circle currently expands at a constant linear rate but it would look even better if instead its expansion slowed down over time this is called easing out so rather than changing size by 10 each frame we calculate the easing figure using a subtract block starting with a hundred and seventy percent that's the maximum size we are aiming to expand our Circle to from this we subtract the current size of the explosion Sprite that gives us the amount left we need to increase by that's nothing if we've already reached our Target size and now we divide dividing the amount left to increase by by nine now the larger this number is the longer it will take for the shape to reach its final size right exciting hit that game over script oh yeah that's what I'm talking about the new easing out gives it that professional touch right now just before we move on I think it best to drop in a hide block at the end I just feel better knowing that the Sprite is not hanging around on screen even if it is ghosted to nothing great time to see this fully in game smash that green flag perfect that's just as I hoped it's looking better and better except my OCD simply cannot take this anymore does anyone else notice that oh so tiny but highly annoying step down in the level as the player moves from Level costume number one to costume two ah man I hate it and it does seem strange because the ground is an exact duplicate between costumes one and two they should line up perfectly well not to worry if you want to fix it you can just drop in another rectangle at the top of our levels again out of sight and that alone is enough to fix my first screen crazy and you may need to add them to more than one just see how you go phew now I can move on the next stage of our explosion is to add in those particles the particle burst now this is what really brings the whole animation together particles begin at the center of the player and then spread outwards in a circle now we already added the particle Sprite and that was used to create the trail behind the player however we won't try to reuse it instead right click or long press on mobile and duplicate the particles Sprite this time we'll name it explode particles or perhaps particle burst if you prefer okay the costume can stay exactly the same click into the coding tab so unlike the particle Trail a particle burst must generate many clones all at once the trigger is once again from a game over event when I receive game over we want to

need to make a new custom block boom and tick the run without screen refresh checkbox this will do the trick now all 40 clones will be created without waiting around excellent just drop the boom block under the game over receiver okay next up we want to code the particle's motion when I start as a clone now although the original particle scripts follow a similar pattern we'd be better to move them off and cherry pick the blocks we need the go to player that stays the same but we don't want to offset the position with the change X or Y blocks set size yeah we need that but up the picked sizes between 75 and 150 this time ah speed X and speed y so okay I'm going to switch to use a direction and speed this time around so drop in a point in Direction block and we'll pick a direction between negative 180 and 180. that's a full circle around the player and will help to form a circle of projectiles and now to set the speed so this should just read set speed not set speed X we can rename the

particle burst lasts for a longer time and reduce the ghost effect down to four wow that was a lot of fiddling around I hope we will be suitably rewarded when we run these scripts to do so we're going

cubes are all rotated in the direction of travel we don't want this they should stay upright at all times and we can quickly fix that by clicking into the direction input and hitting the don't rotate option that's the third one across good that solves that one now for the power the speed we need to up the particle's initial speed let's try form three all the way up to 12. they should be quite fast click oh yes now that's more like it this particle burst is looking so much better for those small tweaks I've got to see this in game smash that green bunting oh marvelous it looks even better combined with the central circle too this is partly because of how the particles outpace the circle as the circle slows down with that easing we added now you might think we are done there and it's

30. that gives some particles a head start in fading away and then also we can make the particles shrink in size as they fade change size by negative three and now let's see this in action yeah it's coming along but the biggie is this in real Geometry Dash when particles overlap they change their color to become more white I love that and it's not so easy to replicate in scratch Faithfully but we can emulate it just a tat by setting the brightness effect before the repeat Loop to 100 that's as bright as we can make it so now our particles appear white instead of blue and then we quickly fade back to Blue using a change brightness effect by negative 20. drop that into our repeat Loop except there is a problem with that the brightness quickly goes too far the other way and makes our particles black oh great no problem though we'll handle the brightness in our own script when I start as clone again repeat but only this time for five frames and in there we change the brightness by negative 20. and run the project great that fixed it getting too dark but the white effect is so quick I can hardly see it how about we hold it at White for a few extra frames we can do that with a weight before the repeat for three frames that's calculated as three thirtieths of a second that's 0.1 seconds and that's it our particle explosion is complete and I'm really very happy with that all we need to do is Fade Out the player for the final effect so in the player Sprite scroll down to the game overscript and no surprises here change ghost effect by and we want this to be very quick so enter a value of 20. here goes nothing and wow all our hard work has paid off I don't think it could get a lot better looking than this what do you think did we miss anything let me know in the comments let's try a wall Collision oh boy that's really good and it sets us up nicely for the next episode where we're gonna ditch having to click that green flag to start the game so noob finally having the option to restart the level in game I'm looking forward to that and hey if you have a request for what we cover next then drop it in the comments under the video do remember to submit your
