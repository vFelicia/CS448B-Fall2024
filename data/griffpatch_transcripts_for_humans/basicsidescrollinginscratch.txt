00:00 - hi Grif patch here and I want to show
00:02 - you today how to create a simple
00:04 - scrolling game in scratch it's gonna be
00:07 - really basic because there's lots to do
00:09 - with scrolling games when things get
00:11 - complicated but I want to really try
00:13 - keep this as easy as possible so this is
00:15 - the little project I've put together
00:16 - here you can see I've got scratch cat
00:18 - I've got some things moving I can move
00:21 - around and if I move to the right the
00:23 - level Scrolls and all is good so let's
00:27 - start off with a completely blank
00:28 - project create new project
00:32 - so what I'll try and do is go through
00:34 - quite quickly creating the project and
00:36 - then maybe I'll explain more detail
00:38 - afterwards let's see how that goes so
00:40 - new project starts there scratch cats
00:42 - give it a name scrolling project okay
00:47 - and I'm gonna name my scratch cat as
00:49 - player so we know who he is
00:51 - this is dar player and I make him so he
00:54 - moves left and right only points in the
00:57 - direction left my early
00:58 - okay so backgrounds let's add a
01:01 - background from the library we can
01:03 - choose blue sky now what me is that
01:07 - can't scroll it's a background
01:08 - backgrounds don't scroll and you can't
01:10 - get away from that before age me the
01:11 - stage so let's create a new sprite and
01:16 - we're going to call this background okay
01:21 - and this is not gonna rotate at all good
01:25 - and we're gonna take a nice background
01:28 - at me out there and I'm gonna drag it
01:29 - into my sprite okay and now I'm going to
01:33 - change my actual stage background to
01:35 - white so we could see there's this white
01:37 - area behind and now we can move our
01:41 - background and like before so that's the
01:44 - basis let's get rid of this empty
01:46 - costume so it just got a nice costume of
01:48 - blue sky okay I got add some scripts in
01:52 - here first off let's go into the player
01:56 - supply because this is the way this is
01:57 - where everything happens this is where
01:58 - things kick off so I'll have a green
02:00 - flag inside there I am going to add a
02:04 - variable called scroll X you'll see that
02:08 - a lot in scrolling projects we could
02:10 - call it camera X but we like scroll and
02:12 - it's going to be for all spy
02:13 - so they all can see that and we're going
02:16 - to set that to zero at the very
02:17 - beginning so that's where we start
02:19 - scrolling from will keep that ever now
02:21 - now we want to have some broadcasts in
02:26 - my projects I very rarely have more than
02:28 - one green flag clicked I like to keep
02:31 - things in control of my own control so I
02:34 - don't like them running in all different
02:37 - sprites you never know quite how
02:38 - projects start up so let's keep it
02:40 - simple by having one and then
02:42 - broadcasting from there so we are in
02:44 - control so in a broadcast setup so
02:49 - everything that were wants to happen can
02:50 - be set up in that broadcast and it won't
02:54 - continue running until that's finished
02:56 - because I've got broadcasting wait and
02:58 - then we're gonna do some more sitting up
03:00 - not more setting up so I start getting
03:03 - some loops running so let's start a
03:04 - broadcast without this this is not a
03:06 - wait broadcast this is a normal
03:08 - broadcast and I'm gonna call this player
03:13 - okay and a receiver for that in this
03:19 - place right there it is that's ready and
03:22 - I'm gonna have another broadcast in here
03:27 - called loop this all come clear later
03:35 - and another one called background loop
03:43 - and finally one more I'm going to call
03:48 - other loops okay this is my foundation
03:52 - for starting loops of code off in the
03:55 - right order this is the order I want
03:57 - them to run in so the moment there's
03:59 - nothing receiving these broadcasts but
04:00 - that's fine
04:01 - we got to do that later so in the
04:04 - background let's have a receiver for the
04:07 - background loop well that's convenient
04:09 - that's what I want so the background
04:11 - loop no it's not what I want I'm like
04:14 - sorry and I wanted was a setup okay so
04:17 - at the very beginning we're gonna set up
04:18 - where our background is so for that for
04:22 - now I'm going to stick it as I go to
04:24 - zero zero
04:26 - okay sis click that yeah nicely
04:29 - positioned right to where it should be
04:32 - I also want to make sure that the cat is
04:34 - in front of the background let's click
04:37 - on the cat and we'll stick where's the
04:40 - go to front
04:41 - let's hit they go to actually no you
04:43 - ever do that do you yes you do okay go
04:46 - to front there he is good I was missing
04:49 - mr. cat right what next
04:53 - so let's get the cat so that he falls
04:56 - down on to the floor so where this had
04:58 - some stuff into the player scripts now
05:02 - let's have a forever loop within our
05:03 - player loop receiver and in we will have
05:08 - a motion and we'll change our Y position
05:13 - by minus eight that will just make him
05:16 - loop straight down towards the floor if
05:18 - I run that in fact so much so he falls
05:20 - to it which is fine let's put let's put
05:25 - two go to zero zero above there so we
05:27 - can press it again of an it okay there
05:29 - he goes falling down no gradual
05:33 - gravitation stuff in this project - no
05:35 - nice smooth moving I'm just gonna make
05:37 - him fall down at the constant speed just
05:40 - for simplicity right so we won't stop
05:42 - him on the ground
05:43 - so let's but if after reason being moved
05:46 - down we will check to see whether he's
05:47 - touching the ground or not in this case
05:50 - I'm using color sensing so if he's
05:53 - touching brown then I will move him back
05:56 - up again simple as that so now he should
06:00 - just stop on the ground yeah beautiful
06:02 - okay and now we need a little bit of
06:04 - movement to move left and right
06:05 - otherwise we're not gonna be able to
06:07 - scroll very much are we that's but an if
06:09 - in here if sensing if the key is pressed
06:15 - and it's the right arrow then we want to
06:20 - change our position and again I'm gonna
06:23 - choose eight that's enough I press the
06:25 - right arrow let's run the project first
06:27 - my dome there we go he moves
06:31 - however he just moved off the screen and
06:33 - that's not quite what we got achieving
06:35 - at the end so what we need to do next
06:38 - so the secret of scrolling is you don't
06:41 - want the cat to look like he's moving
06:42 - along the level you want the level to
06:44 - look like it's moving behind the cat so
06:46 - what we need to do here is get when the
06:48 - cat moves to the right you want the like
06:50 - the camera to move to the right - so the
06:52 - whole it looks like the whole thing is
06:54 - moving to the left so what we need to do
06:57 - is change that scroll X so if we go into
07:03 - the background we want this to be moving
07:05 - now when the cat moves so let's get our
07:08 - new event to receiver and this is the
07:11 - background loop like we had before which
07:13 - is great we have a forever loop okay now
07:18 - we've got a scroll X that's great so
07:21 - we're going to reposition this
07:24 - background set the x position of the
07:27 - background to be nice it might look a
07:30 - bit complicated it's not it's good it's
07:32 - easy it will get used to it
07:33 - 0 - scroll X that means is the negative
07:38 - version of scroll X so scroll X changes
07:40 - by 10 our background will move to the
07:42 - left by 10 okay
07:45 - you can test that if I run the project I
07:48 - should now be able to put a set scroll
07:51 - to a value like 10 click that and it
07:56 - should maybe I see that move back to the
07:58 - left to verify if we get change change
08:01 - by 10 maybe time I click that it'll
08:05 - scroll the background to the left
08:07 - beautiful okay so in my scratch cat now
08:14 - I'm gonna add another receiver this
08:18 - receiver is the camera loop so we're
08:23 - broadcasting that there so after this
08:26 - player loop has run through and we've
08:28 - moved our cat I'm now going to move the
08:31 - background so that both the cat and the
08:34 - background will move to meet where the
08:37 - cats moved to to try and keep the cat in
08:39 - the middle of the screen so what we were
08:43 - to do is look for the cat having moved
08:45 - to the right so if we go into motion
08:49 - and we look for expedition there we go
08:51 - say if the exposition of the cat is
08:54 - greater than zero so he's moved to the
08:56 - right we're going to do its change the
09:02 - scroll X by eight and this is important
09:10 - we need to move the cat to the left by
09:13 - eight so it's in line with the scrolling
09:17 - so it's closed the camera moves the
09:19 - light cat therefore moves to the left so
09:22 - if we run that now and move to the right
09:26 - nothing happens
09:28 - ah see my mistake there I'm very sorry
09:32 - look at this so I've got a camera loop
09:33 - and there's no loop in there they stick
09:36 - a forever loop around that let's try it
09:39 - again
09:39 - okay moved to the right there we go so
09:42 - now when I moved to the right level
09:45 - moved to the left and I stay stationary
09:47 - this is quite cool in fact if you play
09:51 - around with this you'll see it's
09:51 - actually quite flexible so if I change
09:53 - the scroll to - and - - and run that
09:55 - again if I move to the right level
09:58 - slowly Scrolls to meet me so you can do
10:02 - some quite cunning effects here but for
10:04 - now let's keep them in the middle let's
10:05 - move in the same amount eight and that
10:09 - keeps him nice and in line with the
10:11 - scrolling and now you see the next
10:14 - problem if you scroll the level across
10:16 - you end up with a big gap you need more
10:18 - level so let's add some more level in
10:21 - okay for this I am going to change my
10:24 - background so what I need is a new
10:26 - variable called level X and this has to
10:32 - be for this right only it's very
10:33 - important because each each screen of
10:37 - the level has to have its own position
10:39 - so let's add that in there get rid of
10:42 - the on the screen and start my setting
10:45 - level X to zero this is in a set up a
10:48 - stage not the running stage setup so
10:52 - what we do is use some clones here so
10:54 - we're going to set the level to zero
10:55 - we're going to load in ourselves create
10:59 - clone of myself
11:01 - then I'm gonna change X by 480 that's a
11:08 - full screen width right and now down
11:14 - here where we've got the receiver rather
11:17 - than being positioned zero we're going
11:19 - to put our level X into there and I run
11:22 - that and now you see this we have two
11:26 - screens we own that again first green
11:31 - second screen that was easy wasn't it
11:34 - and of course what you can do in here
11:36 - then is create some different parts of
11:38 - the level so I'll duplicate the costume
11:40 - and I'll add a little bit of something
11:42 - else slightly different to this one are
11:45 - adding a bit of it's in the first sprite
11:50 - let's add in a bit of platform here like
11:52 - this and in the second one I'll add in
12:00 - that I'll add in a fluffy cloud
12:16 - okay like that okay good now if you go
12:21 - in here so when you were cloning our
12:23 - background what I need to do is change
12:25 - the costumes so if I set the costume to
12:28 - begin with to be our first costume blue
12:32 - sky and then I just put a next costume
12:35 - after the clone so now we run that now
12:39 - I'm stuck in the middle let's change the
12:40 - opposition of our little count here so
12:42 - rather than being zero zero let's put
12:44 - him up a bit higher a hundred higher
12:48 - there we go so he's on this fall's down
12:51 - that's awfully loud excellent so what if
12:56 - I want even more screens well of course
12:58 - that's really easy now you can see in
12:59 - here all we need to do
13:00 - it's duplicate up from the clone like
13:04 - that and that will keep going through to
13:07 - the next costume each time so cloud and
13:10 - then we'll go back to this first one
13:11 - again okay you could loop that around
13:14 - and create lots and lots of those okay
13:17 - so maybe what that'd be worthwhile is
13:21 - putting in another movement so we can
13:23 - move left as well so let's just
13:24 - duplicate up the move right and change
13:28 - it so this is now a left and that moves
13:32 - him by minus eight on that thing so I
13:36 - can move left I can move right move left
13:39 - and it doesn't scroll back now this is a
13:41 - common feature in lots of games like
13:43 - Super Mario and things you you can keep
13:45 - progressing but you can't move Mac and
13:48 - that's a design decision you can choose
13:49 - whether your game wants to be like that
13:50 - or not it actually is very easy to do
13:53 - both both types of scrolling if we
13:56 - wanted it to scroll back and forward we
13:59 - can change this scrolling here to allow
14:01 - for different directions for example so
14:05 - I could put what's the best way of doing
14:07 - this let me have a quick think no let's
14:09 - not do that so what we can do if you
14:17 - want it to scroll exactly the same so
14:19 - let's stop the program let's change
14:21 - scroll X by position X
14:27 - and set exposition to zero now that if I
14:31 - run that well now keep it in line but I
14:35 - can get back as well yeah that's pretty
14:41 - well so depending what you want so this
14:45 - now if he can't moves to the right
14:47 - it changes the scroll though by how much
14:49 - is moved by or again to the left it
14:51 - changed it by how far he's moved to the
14:53 - left and then it puts me back in the
14:54 - middle so that's the alternative way of
14:56 - doing it but I'll take that out because
14:58 - I was trying to write her a game that
15:01 - scrolled with my cat to the right but
15:05 - not to the left okay now next thing to
15:08 - notice is how sprites don't move off the
15:12 - screen very nicely if I add a new sprite
15:16 - here now I'm going to call this Apple
15:22 - and I'm gonna add a costume from the
15:25 - library let's try and find an Apple I
15:28 - think it's there we go
15:29 - good old Apple there we go there we go
15:36 - okay now objects in games after scroll
15:40 - of course with the background so we need
15:42 - to with my cat gone why is he
15:46 - disappeared behind I need to bring him
15:49 - back to the front looks there he is
15:53 - Apple different there we go right so
15:57 - this Apple needs to move with the
15:58 - background just like the background
15:59 - moved with the scroll X so let's put in
16:03 - some scripts now I've already got the
16:05 - receivers ready so we've got in it I'm
16:08 - not in it so I setup I call it this time
16:09 - sometimes it's called the init to
16:10 - initialize but we're calling a setup
16:12 - this is where we need to position the
16:14 - Apple and again we gonna have to have a
16:16 - special Apple X for this sprite only
16:21 - okay set Apple x2 and the position I
16:24 - want them to be let's put him at let's
16:28 - put its life further off screen so we
16:30 - can scroll along to find him that's put
16:32 - it at 300 and
16:37 - to set his Y position to be zero it's
16:46 - fine right in the middle of the screen
16:48 - vertically and then we need to our event
16:51 - receiver for the other loops right good
16:57 - all other things other than the
16:59 - background and the player will go under
17:01 - other loop that's why I mean deciding
17:03 - anyhow so forever loop in there well
17:05 - when you do is position him for now so
17:07 - it's the same as the background so let
17:11 - me just copy that in into the Apple I'm
17:16 - instead of level X it needs to be a Plex
17:19 - I right click there to do that but this
17:22 - colics is the same say now if I run that
17:25 - there is the Apple in our level but look
17:30 - see how he stays on the side of the
17:32 - screen on the left or on the right and I
17:36 - haven't reached him yet that is the
17:38 - problem with scrolling games in scratch
17:39 - scratch does not allow objects sprites
17:42 - to go off the screen not completely they
17:44 - always stay on by between well it's 12
17:47 - pixels off the screen I believe but
17:49 - because they have wide borders sometimes
17:52 - they can be this is the outline of the
17:54 - Apple they can actually stick out even
17:55 - more so I tend to add a border around
17:58 - each scrolling project of about 16
18:01 - pixels to hide these things that are
18:04 - often meant to be off screen but aren't
18:05 - off screen so let's add in another
18:08 - sprite called border like so doesn't
18:14 - have to rotate and all we need to do to
18:18 - initialize it it is ad in the setup and
18:25 - position it at 0 0 and it has to be at
18:32 - the front go to front costume now we
18:38 - want to draw this nice and neat so if we
18:40 - zoom in and we want to in bitmap mode
18:44 - makes easier now scroll the screen to
18:46 - the bottom left now you see his little
18:49 - scrolling a bit more
18:51 - zoom in a bit more if I scroll to the
18:53 - bottom your notice that this
18:56 - checkerboard pattern is quite a useful
18:58 - thing if I click on block and black and
19:02 - filled so each one these blocks is four
19:05 - pixels so to be 16 pixels we need it to
19:08 - be four of them so we need to draw a
19:10 - block that is covering four of these
19:13 - okay like that so it's perfectly sized
19:17 - before hi so if we zoom out
19:19 - click on the select tool select that
19:25 - square a bit of it and then drag it out
19:28 - sideways that means we have a perfectly
19:30 - sized for pics or 16 pixel high now we
19:35 - can zoom in and do the same for the
19:40 - vertical so draw a cube that's 4 cross
19:45 - so zoom out select drag up like that
19:56 - zoom in to the top left draw if you can
20:06 - 4 pixels it actually looks like I could
20:11 - drag that out maybe if i zoom out now
20:13 - before I go yes this is easier I'll do
20:17 - that yes better zoom in scroll to the
20:20 - left let's go to the bottom draw your 4
20:27 - like that zoom out
20:29 - I'm trying it up excellence there
20:31 - perfect if I would not now okay you can
20:35 - now see Apple is not visible it's behind
20:38 - that black like scroll across there he
20:40 - is and if I go across further to the
20:43 - left can't see him perfect there you go
20:47 - see
20:50 - and you can add movement scripts and
20:52 - things into Apple so I've got this other
20:55 - loops here running which is setting his
20:56 - position to the where he's scrolling to
20:58 - but you can actually add more loops in a
21:02 - like type of a say for example in here
21:05 - and this is the reason I'm using these
21:07 - loops in this way is I can put in a
21:10 - repeat say 20 and I can make him move
21:17 - change Y by 3 and then repeat 20 change
21:26 - Y by minus 3 for example and run that
21:31 - and if I come across there you go and
21:37 - now if you want him to move sideways
21:39 - you'll be careful
21:40 - because you do not want to use change X
21:42 - because the apples exposition is no
21:44 - longer defined by his scratches
21:48 - exposition you have to use your data
21:50 - variable Apple X so if I wanted him to
21:53 - move sideways let's do another loop that
21:56 - makes him move sideways so this time
22:00 - I'll make him do this very quickly here
22:03 - so maybe let's do it even more so for
22:07 - just loops of four I'm gonna change
22:10 - Apple X by eight and I'm the other one
22:16 - I'm gonna change it but I'm minus eight
22:17 - now run that that's going to find him
22:22 - yeah see I have to use the Apple X
22:25 - because as you scroll his position
22:27 - changes so it needs to be controlled by
22:30 - his Apple X which we set at the top
22:32 - there cool and that's pretty much it I
22:41 - hope that was useful I'm gonna expand on
22:44 - this and add lots more things to it do
22:46 - comment love the video and tell me what
22:49 - you think there's so much more to cover
22:52 - but that will do for now I think thanks
22:55 - for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hi Grif patch here and I want to show you today how to create a simple scrolling game in scratch it's gonna be really basic because there's lots to do with scrolling games when things get complicated but I want to really try keep this as easy as possible so this is the little project I've put together here you can see I've got scratch cat I've got some things moving I can move around and if I move to the right the level Scrolls and all is good so let's start off with a completely blank project create new project so what I'll try and do is go through quite quickly creating the project and then maybe I'll explain more detail afterwards let's see how that goes so new project starts there scratch cats give it a name scrolling project okay and I'm gonna name my scratch cat as player so we know who he is this is dar player and I make him so he moves left and right only points in the direction left my early okay so backgrounds let's add a background from the library we can choose blue sky now what me is that can't scroll it's a background backgrounds don't scroll and you can't get away from that before age me the stage so let's create a new sprite and we're going to call this background okay and this is not gonna rotate at all good and we're gonna take a nice background at me out there and I'm gonna drag it into my sprite okay and now I'm going to change my actual stage background to white so we could see there's this white area behind and now we can move our background and like before so that's the basis let's get rid of this empty costume so it just got a nice costume of blue sky okay I got add some scripts in here first off let's go into the player supply because this is the way this is where everything happens this is where things kick off so I'll have a green flag inside there I am going to add a variable called scroll X you'll see that a lot in scrolling projects we could call it camera X but we like scroll and it's going to be for all spy so they all can see that and we're going to set that to zero at the very beginning so that's where we start scrolling from will keep that ever now now we want to have some broadcasts in my projects I very rarely have more than one green flag clicked I like to keep things in control of my own control so I don't like them running in all different sprites you never know quite how projects start up so let's keep it simple by having one and then broadcasting from there so we are in control so in a broadcast setup so everything that were wants to happen can be set up in that broadcast and it won't continue running until that's finished because I've got broadcasting wait and then we're gonna do some more sitting up not more setting up so I start getting some loops running so let's start a broadcast without this this is not a wait broadcast this is a normal broadcast and I'm gonna call this player okay and a receiver for that in this place right there it is that's ready and I'm gonna have another broadcast in here called loop this all come clear later and another one called background loop and finally one more I'm going to call other loops okay this is my foundation for starting loops of code off in the right order this is the order I want them to run in so the moment there's nothing receiving these broadcasts but that's fine we got to do that later so in the background let's have a receiver for the background loop well that's convenient that's what I want so the background loop no it's not what I want I'm like sorry and I wanted was a setup okay so at the very beginning we're gonna set up where our background is so for that for now I'm going to stick it as I go to zero zero okay sis click that yeah nicely positioned right to where it should be I also want to make sure that the cat is in front of the background let's click on the cat and we'll stick where's the go to front let's hit they go to actually no you ever do that do you yes you do okay go to front there he is good I was missing mr. cat right what next so let's get the cat so that he falls down on to the floor so where this had some stuff into the player scripts now let's have a forever loop within our player loop receiver and in we will have a motion and we'll change our Y position by minus eight that will just make him loop straight down towards the floor if I run that in fact so much so he falls to it which is fine let's put let's put two go to zero zero above there so we can press it again of an it okay there he goes falling down no gradual gravitation stuff in this project no nice smooth moving I'm just gonna make him fall down at the constant speed just for simplicity right so we won't stop him on the ground so let's but if after reason being moved down we will check to see whether he's touching the ground or not in this case I'm using color sensing so if he's touching brown then I will move him back up again simple as that so now he should just stop on the ground yeah beautiful okay and now we need a little bit of movement to move left and right otherwise we're not gonna be able to scroll very much are we that's but an if in here if sensing if the key is pressed and it's the right arrow then we want to change our position and again I'm gonna choose eight that's enough I press the right arrow let's run the project first my dome there we go he moves however he just moved off the screen and that's not quite what we got achieving at the end so what we need to do next so the secret of scrolling is you don't want the cat to look like he's moving along the level you want the level to look like it's moving behind the cat so what we need to do here is get when the cat moves to the right you want the like the camera to move to the right so the whole it looks like the whole thing is moving to the left so what we need to do is change that scroll X so if we go into the background we want this to be moving now when the cat moves so let's get our new event to receiver and this is the background loop like we had before which is great we have a forever loop okay now we've got a scroll X that's great so we're going to reposition this background set the x position of the background to be nice it might look a bit complicated it's not it's good it's easy it will get used to it 0 scroll X that means is the negative version of scroll X so scroll X changes by 10 our background will move to the left by 10 okay you can test that if I run the project I should now be able to put a set scroll to a value like 10 click that and it should maybe I see that move back to the left to verify if we get change change by 10 maybe time I click that it'll scroll the background to the left beautiful okay so in my scratch cat now I'm gonna add another receiver this receiver is the camera loop so we're broadcasting that there so after this player loop has run through and we've moved our cat I'm now going to move the background so that both the cat and the background will move to meet where the cats moved to to try and keep the cat in the middle of the screen so what we were to do is look for the cat having moved to the right so if we go into motion and we look for expedition there we go say if the exposition of the cat is greater than zero so he's moved to the right we're going to do its change the scroll X by eight and this is important we need to move the cat to the left by eight so it's in line with the scrolling so it's closed the camera moves the light cat therefore moves to the left so if we run that now and move to the right nothing happens ah see my mistake there I'm very sorry look at this so I've got a camera loop and there's no loop in there they stick a forever loop around that let's try it again okay moved to the right there we go so now when I moved to the right level moved to the left and I stay stationary this is quite cool in fact if you play around with this you'll see it's actually quite flexible so if I change the scroll to and and run that again if I move to the right level slowly Scrolls to meet me so you can do some quite cunning effects here but for now let's keep them in the middle let's move in the same amount eight and that keeps him nice and in line with the scrolling and now you see the next problem if you scroll the level across you end up with a big gap you need more level so let's add some more level in okay for this I am going to change my background so what I need is a new variable called level X and this has to be for this right only it's very important because each each screen of the level has to have its own position so let's add that in there get rid of the on the screen and start my setting level X to zero this is in a set up a stage not the running stage setup so what we do is use some clones here so we're going to set the level to zero we're going to load in ourselves create clone of myself then I'm gonna change X by 480 that's a full screen width right and now down here where we've got the receiver rather than being positioned zero we're going to put our level X into there and I run that and now you see this we have two screens we own that again first green second screen that was easy wasn't it and of course what you can do in here then is create some different parts of the level so I'll duplicate the costume and I'll add a little bit of something else slightly different to this one are adding a bit of it's in the first sprite let's add in a bit of platform here like this and in the second one I'll add in that I'll add in a fluffy cloud okay like that okay good now if you go in here so when you were cloning our background what I need to do is change the costumes so if I set the costume to begin with to be our first costume blue sky and then I just put a next costume after the clone so now we run that now I'm stuck in the middle let's change the opposition of our little count here so rather than being zero zero let's put him up a bit higher a hundred higher there we go so he's on this fall's down that's awfully loud excellent so what if I want even more screens well of course that's really easy now you can see in here all we need to do it's duplicate up from the clone like that and that will keep going through to the next costume each time so cloud and then we'll go back to this first one again okay you could loop that around and create lots and lots of those okay so maybe what that'd be worthwhile is putting in another movement so we can move left as well so let's just duplicate up the move right and change it so this is now a left and that moves him by minus eight on that thing so I can move left I can move right move left and it doesn't scroll back now this is a common feature in lots of games like Super Mario and things you you can keep progressing but you can't move Mac and that's a design decision you can choose whether your game wants to be like that or not it actually is very easy to do both both types of scrolling if we wanted it to scroll back and forward we can change this scrolling here to allow for different directions for example so I could put what's the best way of doing this let me have a quick think no let's not do that so what we can do if you want it to scroll exactly the same so let's stop the program let's change scroll X by position X and set exposition to zero now that if I run that well now keep it in line but I can get back as well yeah that's pretty well so depending what you want so this now if he can't moves to the right it changes the scroll though by how much is moved by or again to the left it changed it by how far he's moved to the left and then it puts me back in the middle so that's the alternative way of doing it but I'll take that out because I was trying to write her a game that scrolled with my cat to the right but not to the left okay now next thing to notice is how sprites don't move off the screen very nicely if I add a new sprite here now I'm going to call this Apple and I'm gonna add a costume from the library let's try and find an Apple I think it's there we go good old Apple there we go there we go okay now objects in games after scroll of course with the background so we need to with my cat gone why is he disappeared behind I need to bring him back to the front looks there he is Apple different there we go right so this Apple needs to move with the background just like the background moved with the scroll X so let's put in some scripts now I've already got the receivers ready so we've got in it I'm not in it so I setup I call it this time sometimes it's called the init to initialize but we're calling a setup this is where we need to position the Apple and again we gonna have to have a special Apple X for this sprite only okay set Apple x2 and the position I want them to be let's put him at let's put its life further off screen so we can scroll along to find him that's put it at 300 and to set his Y position to be zero it's fine right in the middle of the screen vertically and then we need to our event receiver for the other loops right good all other things other than the background and the player will go under other loop that's why I mean deciding anyhow so forever loop in there well when you do is position him for now so it's the same as the background so let me just copy that in into the Apple I'm instead of level X it needs to be a Plex I right click there to do that but this colics is the same say now if I run that there is the Apple in our level but look see how he stays on the side of the screen on the left or on the right and I haven't reached him yet that is the problem with scrolling games in scratch scratch does not allow objects sprites to go off the screen not completely they always stay on by between well it's 12 pixels off the screen I believe but because they have wide borders sometimes they can be this is the outline of the Apple they can actually stick out even more so I tend to add a border around each scrolling project of about 16 pixels to hide these things that are often meant to be off screen but aren't off screen so let's add in another sprite called border like so doesn't have to rotate and all we need to do to initialize it it is ad in the setup and position it at 0 0 and it has to be at the front go to front costume now we want to draw this nice and neat so if we zoom in and we want to in bitmap mode makes easier now scroll the screen to the bottom left now you see his little scrolling a bit more zoom in a bit more if I scroll to the bottom your notice that this checkerboard pattern is quite a useful thing if I click on block and black and filled so each one these blocks is four pixels so to be 16 pixels we need it to be four of them so we need to draw a block that is covering four of these okay like that so it's perfectly sized before hi so if we zoom out click on the select tool select that square a bit of it and then drag it out sideways that means we have a perfectly sized for pics or 16 pixel high now we can zoom in and do the same for the vertical so draw a cube that's 4 cross so zoom out select drag up like that zoom in to the top left draw if you can 4 pixels it actually looks like I could drag that out maybe if i zoom out now before I go yes this is easier I'll do that yes better zoom in scroll to the left let's go to the bottom draw your 4 like that zoom out I'm trying it up excellence there perfect if I would not now okay you can now see Apple is not visible it's behind that black like scroll across there he is and if I go across further to the left can't see him perfect there you go see and you can add movement scripts and things into Apple so I've got this other loops here running which is setting his position to the where he's scrolling to but you can actually add more loops in a like type of a say for example in here and this is the reason I'm using these loops in this way is I can put in a repeat say 20 and I can make him move change Y by 3 and then repeat 20 change Y by minus 3 for example and run that and if I come across there you go and now if you want him to move sideways you'll be careful because you do not want to use change X because the apples exposition is no longer defined by his scratches exposition you have to use your data variable Apple X so if I wanted him to move sideways let's do another loop that makes him move sideways so this time I'll make him do this very quickly here so maybe let's do it even more so for just loops of four I'm gonna change Apple X by eight and I'm the other one I'm gonna change it but I'm minus eight now run that that's going to find him yeah see I have to use the Apple X because as you scroll his position changes so it needs to be controlled by his Apple X which we set at the top there cool and that's pretty much it I hope that was useful I'm gonna expand on this and add lots more things to it do comment love the video and tell me what you think there's so much more to cover but that will do for now I think thanks for watching
