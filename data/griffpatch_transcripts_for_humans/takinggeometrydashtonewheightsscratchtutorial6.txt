00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow geometry scratchers and
00:05 - welcome back to episode 6 of how to make
00:08 - Geometry Dash in scratch and I know what
00:10 - you need you need more screen space to
00:13 - work with you need vertical scrolling
00:15 - levels and yes yes you also need jump
00:18 - pads ships and other game modes level
00:20 - selection and go an actual end to each
00:22 - level okay so there's a lot to get
00:25 - excited about but let's focus vertical
00:28 - scrolling the problem is even after we
00:30 - get the scene to scroll up we're still
00:32 - going to run out of space in the costume
00:34 - Editor to extend our levels much further
00:37 - so what are we going to do about that
00:39 - then well don't you think this floor in
00:41 - each costume is a bit of a waste of
00:43 - space are you thinking what I'm thinking
00:46 - if so then drop me a comment right now
00:48 - but hold the phone also in this episode
00:51 - crazy new game mode invented geometry
00:54 - crawl stay on target watch out for that
00:57 - wall stay on target more on that soon
01:00 - enough because it's time to load up our
01:02 - projects from episode 5 and remember to
01:05 - save them as a fresh new copy guys this
01:08 - is episode 6 let's get
01:12 - scratching we jump straight into the
01:14 - level Sprite and we want it to be easy
01:17 - to test this vertical scrolling so I'm
01:18 - going to rearrange these stair climbing
01:21 - costumes bringing them right up to the
01:23 - second and third costume positions for
01:25 - the time being and for added fun I'll
01:28 - pop in yet another stare on scene 4 to
01:31 - really push the limits and yes this is
01:34 - going to fail badly we run out of space
01:37 - and it it's game over so it's going to
01:40 - be hard to get this level to scroll up
01:42 - and down right well let's see we'll
01:45 - temporarily split off the broadcast game
01:47 - on from the reset level script that will
01:50 - prevent the main game scripts running
01:52 - while we're testing and now create a new
01:54 - variable named camera y making sure it's
01:58 - created for all Sprites this will keep
02:01 - track of how far the screen has scrolled
02:04 - if we double click the variable reporter
02:07 - twice then we can change it into a
02:09 - slider this will make testing fun it's
02:12 - good practice to initialize camera y to
02:15 - zero with a set block at the top of the
02:17 - reset level
02:19 - script and now for the scrolling in the
02:22 - forever Loop next to our change X we
02:25 - drop in a set Y block yes set y not a
02:29 - change y but don't just set it to camera
02:32 - y now when the camera moves up the level
02:35 - will move down so we subtract camera y
02:39 - we can test this Theory right away hit
02:42 - that green flag and start the game and
02:45 - don't worry our game scripts are
02:47 - disabled so we have all the time in the
02:48 - world to play with our new camera wise
02:50 - slider and look at that it works see how
02:54 - as the camera is moved up our level does
02:56 - scroll down by negative camera y That's
02:59 - EX excellent a great start but what
03:01 - about the player they need to scroll up
03:04 - and down too we should reattach the
03:07 - broadcast to game on and then click into
03:10 - the player Sprite another way to give us
03:12 - more time to test is to reduce the
03:15 - initial scroll speed from -10 to -1 yeah
03:20 - that should really slow things down oh
03:23 - my gosh just look how slow this is drag
03:26 - the camera up and back down well the ah
03:30 - moving the camera faster produces
03:32 - jittering and worse than that instant
03:35 - death on a plus note I think I just
03:37 - invented a whole new Ultra slow Geometry
03:39 - Dash game mode geometry sneak creep or
03:43 - crawl anyone oh yeah I'm going to make
03:45 - this jump this is my moment baby here
03:49 - goes what no way oh gosh come on guys
03:55 - this is torture stay on target stay On
04:00 - Target and jump yes who is the man
04:05 - except oh gosh how do we
04:08 - even yeah that was never going to happen
04:11 - Okay I apologize this tutorial has gone
04:14 - way off track the player isn't even
04:16 - scrolling with the camera they are just
04:18 - being pushed around by the level when
04:20 - the level moves If It Moves too much
04:23 - then it is game over but unlike with the
04:26 - level we can't just reposition the
04:28 - player at camera y not unless we want
04:30 - them to be stuck in one position for the
04:32 - entire game yeah I don't think so
04:36 - instead we need to keep track of the
04:38 - last camera position and calculate how
04:41 - much the new camera y has moved since
04:43 - last frame then we can move the player
04:46 - up and down by the same amount and Bobs
04:48 - your uncle so let's make a new variable
04:52 - last camera y making it for this Sprite
04:56 - only then right before our main game
04:59 - Loop set last camera y to you guessed it
05:04 - camera y they begin the same now within
05:08 - the forever Loop we need that change Y
05:10 - block this is to shift the player's
05:12 - position up or down and then drop in a
05:17 - subtract see we want the difference
05:19 - between the last camera
05:21 - Y and the current camera y
05:25 - variable nice we're almost there we just
05:28 - need to ensure that the last camera y
05:30 - always remembers the last camera y value
05:33 - so duplicate that previous line and we
05:36 - can drop it in as the last thing done
05:38 - before the forever Loop repeats around
05:41 - again yes we can test smash that green
05:45 - flag and let's see up and down up and
05:49 - down don't be shy give it a fearsome
05:51 - wiggle yes that's what I'm talking about
05:53 - the player is absolutely glued in sync
05:56 - with the camera and the scrolling level
05:58 - that is really great the C I guess it's
06:01 - time to return the scroll speed back to
06:03 - normal -10 was it
06:05 - not oh my gosh this feels Uber fast now
06:08 - and the stairs is upon us oh the camera
06:11 - oh slider yes in theory if I was quick
06:14 - enough I could slide this up and make H
06:17 - perhaps my platform is slightly
06:18 - misaligned but you get the idea but
06:22 - enough of Sliders it's time to get the
06:24 - camera to automatically follow the
06:27 - player as they ascend and deset the
06:28 - level but it's not quite that simple the
06:31 - level does not want to move up and down
06:34 - with every jump if it did we'd soon get
06:36 - very motion zic I know I would he yikes
06:39 - what we need is a compromise now a
06:42 - common technique is to use scrolling
06:44 - regions while within this central zone
06:47 - the player can move and jump without the
06:49 - level scrolling around but as soon as
06:51 - they move into the scrolling region then
06:54 - off we go very cool the best place to
06:57 -  about our camera is at the end of
07:00 - the main game Loop in our game on script
07:03 - and we'll make a new custom block naming
07:06 - it camera tracking and run without
07:09 - screen
07:11 - refresh the set last camera block can be
07:14 - moved in there and we replace it with a
07:18 - call to the camera tracking script
07:22 - excellent then in some free
07:25 - space firstly where shall we place the
07:28 - top bound of the scroll Zone um
07:31 - somewhere around the 100 Mark I think it
07:34 - has to be surprisingly High to allow for
07:37 - their jumping so
07:40 - if greater than if the player's y
07:44 - position is greater than 100 then we
07:48 - scroll up change camera
07:52 - y by
07:54 - four that seems logical so let's just
07:57 - give that a shot
08:01 - up the stairs and what do you know it's
08:04 - actually working with each jump the
08:06 - camera is pushed up that little bit
08:08 - higher and what a difference that
08:10 - already makes yeah now we just need to
08:13 - bring it back down again if less than if
08:19 - the Y position is less than around where
08:21 - the player is now that's 40 then we
08:24 - scroll down by changing camera y by
08:28 - negative
08:29 - or this time smashing green flags
08:34 - now up up up and down yes that's pretty
08:39 - neat pretty neat but also a little
08:42 - unresponsive to the player's position we
08:45 - need this to be a lot more Snappy
08:47 - getting the camera back down to the
08:49 - ground level the solution is to scroll
08:51 - things faster when there's a greater
08:54 - distance to scroll over to achieve this
08:56 - we calculate how far over the scroll
08:58 - region region they have traveled by by
09:01 - subtracting from the player's y position
09:03 - the top of the scroll region that's 100
09:06 - so they are 35 pixels above it then to
09:10 - make the motion smooth we multiply that
09:13 - answer by a fraction say
09:16 - 0.2 that gives a speed of seven and this
09:20 - speed reduces as we move the player
09:22 - closer to the boundary of the scroll
09:25 - region nice but we don't like these
09:28 - fraction results so we can drop it all
09:31 - inside a round block to round it off
09:35 - three brilliant pop that in the first
09:38 - change camera Y block now for the
09:41 - scrolling down duplicate the same
09:43 - expression and replace that 100 with -4
09:47 - yes that is still
09:49 - ne40 and I'm just going to tweak the
09:52 - smoothing value to
09:54 - 0.15 we can play with these values more
09:57 - later on if we want but right now now
09:59 - let's see what a difference this has
10:02 - [Music]
10:03 - made
10:05 - and yeah the floor returned into view
10:08 - far quicker that's great now before I
10:12 - move on though it might be worth making
10:14 - double Shore that the level is prevented
10:16 - from scrolling down too far below zero
10:19 - just in case if camera Y is less
10:25 - than
10:26 - zero then we set camera y back to zero
10:31 - again
10:33 - simple so are we
10:36 - done not so fast take a look back at our
10:40 - level costumes where the level moves
10:43 - steadily upwards where do we go from
10:46 - here there's no more room to design a
10:48 - level as we've used up all the space
10:50 - already well that is a bummer right I
10:54 - mean if only this huge sway the floor
10:57 - wasn't taking up like a third of each
10:59 - costume wait a moment are you thinking
11:02 - what I'm thinking if we were to remove
11:05 - this floor perhaps into another Sprite
11:08 - then we'd have all this extra room to
11:10 - play with and perhaps that would be all
11:12 - the extra space we need also as an added
11:15 - perk the new floor Sprite could be used
11:17 - to pimp up our title screen too awesome
11:20 - let's do
11:22 - this we begin then by duplicating the
11:25 - entire level
11:26 - Sprite and move it next to the level and
11:31 - then rename it as
11:34 - floor now making sure we are definitely
11:37 - still in the new floor Sprite we
11:40 - ferociously move all but the First
11:43 - costume all we want is the floor so zoom
11:47 - out and if you drew the top and bottom
11:50 - rectangles to allow for offscreen
11:52 - scrolling then you'll probably agree
11:54 - these are going to cause US problems as
11:57 - they now get scrolled into view by a
11:59 - change of camera y well we can safely
12:02 - delete the bottom one at least but the
12:04 - top one H that's another story we still
12:06 - need it to allow the Sprite scroll off
12:08 - screen so instead we're going to make it
12:11 - invisible yeah that's right bring it
12:14 - down into the center of the canvas and
12:16 - with it selected simply change its fill
12:19 - and outline to
12:22 - transparent and it's gone no it's still
12:25 - there and you can select it by clicking
12:27 - its outline
12:29 - or easier still dragging a selection
12:31 - Marquee over it and boom there it is
12:34 - selected once more so it's coding time
12:39 - we're only using a single costume so
12:41 - remove the switch costume block and
12:45 - since the floor wants to be visible now
12:47 - on the title menu we're going to
12:49 - separate the scripts from under the set
12:51 - camera y they will be run on a green
12:53 - flag in a moment oh yes but when we do
12:56 - reset the level also reset y to
13:02 - zero now when green flag clicked since
13:05 - this is only run the once at project
13:08 - startup we don't need to bother deleting
13:10 - clones or even hiding this Sprite so
13:13 - it's these scripts that remain and can
13:15 - be attached under the when flag clicked
13:18 - block oh wait I see another change
13:21 - costume get rid of that one too and
13:25 - remove the broadcast to game on talking
13:28 - of which
13:29 - when I receive game on will bring this
13:32 - floor right to the front of the level
13:35 - where it belongs and to get the floor
13:37 - scrolling even on the title screen we
13:40 - need to set scroll speed to
13:45 - -10 now this is exciting it's time to
13:48 - smash that green flag
13:51 - and well I can't deny that's a little
13:54 - underwhelming it ain't scrolling oh oh I
13:57 - forgot clicking into the menu Sprite
14:00 - because we've left in the fake floor yes
14:04 - there you are isn't that funky a
14:06 - scrolling floor right from the word go
14:09 - so does the floor work in your game
14:12 - too well apparently it might be but it's
14:15 - hard to tell if the floor is showing
14:17 - since our level also has a floor baked
14:20 - into their costumes too guys we' better
14:23 - take a look click back into the level
14:26 - Sprite yes we are still suffering
14:28 - greatly from abundance of floor and we
14:31 - don't need them anymore take a look at
14:34 - costume one and zooming right out so
14:36 - that we can see everything during this
14:38 - process we're going to not only remove
14:40 - the floors but also any of the red bars
14:43 - so for this costume that's literally
14:46 - everything goodbye and because the floor
14:49 - is in a separate Sprite now this works
14:51 - just fine well almost the lack of red
14:55 - rectangles is causing Scene Three to not
14:57 - appear we'll address that soon enough
15:00 - let's move on to costume two though and
15:03 - this is where it gets a little fiddly so
15:05 - pay attention we remove the floor and
15:09 - any red rectangles remember to be zoomed
15:11 - out for that and now we want to move the
15:15 - rest of the level down to sit on the
15:18 - bottom edge of the canvas that will give
15:21 - us lots of delicious space above to play
15:24 - with but before you rush gungho into
15:27 - dragging costumes around remember that
15:29 - it's very important that each costume
15:31 - remains perfectly lined up across the
15:33 - level not something easy to achieve when
15:37 - dragging these individually by hand so
15:40 - instead select everything you can press
15:42 - control a if you like and then make sure
15:46 - you are at the default Zoom just click
15:49 - the equals button
15:50 - there then while holding the shift key
15:54 - tap the down arrow shift and an arrow
15:57 - will move the selected shapes down by
16:00 - exactly 15 pixels as long as you at the
16:04 - default Zoom okay so repeat this 2 3
16:08 - counting them off until we reach the
16:10 - bottom of the canvas 7 8 it's best if
16:14 - the level ends up right on the bottom
16:16 - Edge or just below now remember that
16:19 - eight or whatever it was you got because
16:22 - then we need to move on to the next
16:24 - costume and repeat that procedure
16:26 - exactly as before delete the red
16:28 - rectangle angles and the floor and then
16:30 - with all the other shapes selected and
16:33 - at the default Zoom hold shift and tap
16:36 - the down arrow the exact same number of
16:38 - times eight for me this will ensure all
16:42 - our costumes remain perfectly lined up
16:44 - as they were before in our
16:49 - game okay here we are the costumes are
16:52 - fully
16:53 - transposed step two then is to recreate
16:56 - these scrolling rectangles to allow
16:58 - these level Sprites to scroll out of
17:00 - view position wise I'll drop it in just
17:03 - above the canvas making sure it's
17:05 - centered and most importantly that it's
17:08 - wider than the main canvas area too and
17:11 - then we make its fill transparent and
17:14 - the outline too and now the fun bit
17:17 - using the selection tool copy that
17:20 - rectangle and then working your way
17:23 - through each costume in the level
17:25 - pasting that rectangle in place it
17:27 - should appear in the same position each
17:29 - time which is really
17:31 - useful brilliant that's the costumes
17:34 - done but we are not quite out of the
17:36 - woods yet with our costumes lowered down
17:40 - they are of course appearing far too low
17:42 - down the screen in our game too behind
17:45 - the floor Sprite in fact not a problem
17:48 - into the level code we go see over here
17:51 - where we are positioning the Y position
17:53 - of the level Sprite we need to add to
17:56 - that the same amount that we shifted the
17:59 - level costumes down by and that was
18:02 - eight down key presses for me and if you
18:05 - recall each press was worth 15 pixels 8
18:08 - multiplied by 15 is 120 pixels exactly
18:14 - so whatever your total comes to pop that
18:16 - into the left of this set y position
18:19 - block and we can give it a
18:22 - world oh my word the level returns and
18:26 - it's not looking any the worse for all
18:28 - my tinkering and that that really opens
18:33 - things up for us to expand our level
18:35 - design
18:36 - extensively and here is the fruit of my
18:39 - labor my updated costumes for the start
18:42 - of the stereo Madness level if you want
18:44 - them for reference then well here they
18:47 - are and you can see we certainly needed
18:49 - that extra space in these higher up
18:51 - zones even pushing a little further off
18:53 - the canvas top where necessary oh and
18:57 - this you saw that did you yeah I drew
18:59 - that myself and it's pretty good I
19:01 - thought but your guess is as good as
19:04 - mine as to what it's used for I guess
19:06 - it's got something to do with the next
19:07 - episode shall we check this level out in
19:12 - full and the timing is now a lot better
19:15 - and closer to the
19:18 - original I had to move these stairs
19:20 - closer together otherwise you get out of
19:24 - time and yeah that is a problem it turns
19:27 - out my jump height is a bit too high now
19:31 - to compensate I went in and tweaked the
19:34 - physics of the game increasing Gravity
19:36 - from -4 to
19:40 - -4.3 that will pull the player down just
19:42 - a little bit faster and to match the
19:44 - resulting faster jump increase the
19:46 - rotation to
19:48 - 15° it's not a big change but I think it
19:51 - makes all the difference or my updated
19:53 - level design the player is now
19:55 - synchronized perfectly with the jumps
20:01 - and especially the classic Geometry Dash
20:03 - staircase yeah this is the bee's knees
20:07 - don't ever feel scared to play around
20:09 - with things like this until you get the
20:11 - game just right so guys we are all but
20:15 - ready to wrap up this episode but just
20:17 - before I do we have to fix this glaring
20:20 - problem it happens when we restart mid
20:23 - game make sure you are in the player
20:25 - Sprite and then click the green flag and
20:28 - start the actual game but immediately
20:31 - stop it again before we begin to jump
20:33 - that means the player is flush with the
20:35 - ground and that we can now drag a fresh
20:38 - goto XY block from the pallet to under
20:42 - the when flag clicked script and we are
20:45 - guaranteed now to have the player in
20:47 - just that Sweet Spot while we're at it
20:50 - we might as well also point in Direction
20:52 - 90 so that they are always facing up and
20:56 - that is all there is to it it wow
21:00 - haven't we made some excellent progress
21:02 - today with the new camera tracking and
21:04 - the extra level height to work with our
21:06 - games are surely way cooler and way more
21:09 - fun to play so what's next as promised
21:13 - we'll be adding a new game mode the ship
21:16 - form and guys I'm dead excited about
21:18 - that how about you so if you're enjoying

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow geometry scratchers and welcome back to episode 6 of how to make Geometry Dash in scratch and I know what you need you need more screen space to work with you need vertical scrolling levels and yes yes you also need jump pads ships and other game modes level selection and go an actual end to each level okay so there's a lot to get excited about but let's focus vertical scrolling the problem is even after we get the scene to scroll up we're still going to run out of space in the costume Editor to extend our levels much further so what are we going to do about that then well don't you think this floor in each costume is a bit of a waste of space are you thinking what I'm thinking if so then drop me a comment right now but hold the phone also in this episode crazy new game mode invented geometry crawl stay on target watch out for that wall stay on target more on that soon enough because it's time to load up our projects from episode 5 and remember to save them as a fresh new copy guys this is episode 6 let's get scratching we jump straight into the level Sprite and we want it to be easy to test this vertical scrolling so I'm going to rearrange these stair climbing costumes bringing them right up to the second and third costume positions for the time being and for added fun I'll pop in yet another stare on scene 4 to really push the limits and yes this is going to fail badly we run out of space and it it's game over so it's going to be hard to get this level to scroll up and down right well let's see we'll temporarily split off the broadcast game on from the reset level script that will prevent the main game scripts running while we're testing and now create a new variable named camera y making sure it's created for all Sprites this will keep track of how far the screen has scrolled if we double click the variable reporter twice then we can change it into a slider this will make testing fun it's good practice to initialize camera y to zero with a set block at the top of the reset level script and now for the scrolling in the forever Loop next to our change X we drop in a set Y block yes set y not a change y but don't just set it to camera y now when the camera moves up the level will move down so we subtract camera y we can test this Theory right away hit that green flag and start the game and don't worry our game scripts are disabled so we have all the time in the world to play with our new camera wise slider and look at that it works see how as the camera is moved up our level does scroll down by negative camera y That's EX excellent a great start but what about the player they need to scroll up and down too we should reattach the broadcast to game on and then click into the player Sprite another way to give us more time to test is to reduce the initial scroll speed from 10 to 1 yeah that should really slow things down oh my gosh just look how slow this is drag the camera up and back down well the ah moving the camera faster produces jittering and worse than that instant death on a plus note I think I just invented a whole new Ultra slow Geometry Dash game mode geometry sneak creep or crawl anyone oh yeah I'm going to make this jump this is my moment baby here goes what no way oh gosh come on guys this is torture stay on target stay On Target and jump yes who is the man except oh gosh how do we even yeah that was never going to happen Okay I apologize this tutorial has gone way off track the player isn't even scrolling with the camera they are just being pushed around by the level when the level moves If It Moves too much then it is game over but unlike with the level we can't just reposition the player at camera y not unless we want them to be stuck in one position for the entire game yeah I don't think so instead we need to keep track of the last camera position and calculate how much the new camera y has moved since last frame then we can move the player up and down by the same amount and Bobs your uncle so let's make a new variable last camera y making it for this Sprite only then right before our main game Loop set last camera y to you guessed it camera y they begin the same now within the forever Loop we need that change Y block this is to shift the player's position up or down and then drop in a subtract see we want the difference between the last camera Y and the current camera y variable nice we're almost there we just need to ensure that the last camera y always remembers the last camera y value so duplicate that previous line and we can drop it in as the last thing done before the forever Loop repeats around again yes we can test smash that green flag and let's see up and down up and down don't be shy give it a fearsome wiggle yes that's what I'm talking about the player is absolutely glued in sync with the camera and the scrolling level that is really great the C I guess it's time to return the scroll speed back to normal 10 was it not oh my gosh this feels Uber fast now and the stairs is upon us oh the camera oh slider yes in theory if I was quick enough I could slide this up and make H perhaps my platform is slightly misaligned but you get the idea but enough of Sliders it's time to get the camera to automatically follow the player as they ascend and deset the level but it's not quite that simple the level does not want to move up and down with every jump if it did we'd soon get very motion zic I know I would he yikes what we need is a compromise now a common technique is to use scrolling regions while within this central zone the player can move and jump without the level scrolling around but as soon as they move into the scrolling region then off we go very cool the best place to about our camera is at the end of the main game Loop in our game on script and we'll make a new custom block naming it camera tracking and run without screen refresh the set last camera block can be moved in there and we replace it with a call to the camera tracking script excellent then in some free space firstly where shall we place the top bound of the scroll Zone um somewhere around the 100 Mark I think it has to be surprisingly High to allow for their jumping so if greater than if the player's y position is greater than 100 then we scroll up change camera y by four that seems logical so let's just give that a shot up the stairs and what do you know it's actually working with each jump the camera is pushed up that little bit higher and what a difference that already makes yeah now we just need to bring it back down again if less than if the Y position is less than around where the player is now that's 40 then we scroll down by changing camera y by negative or this time smashing green flags now up up up and down yes that's pretty neat pretty neat but also a little unresponsive to the player's position we need this to be a lot more Snappy getting the camera back down to the ground level the solution is to scroll things faster when there's a greater distance to scroll over to achieve this we calculate how far over the scroll region region they have traveled by by subtracting from the player's y position the top of the scroll region that's 100 so they are 35 pixels above it then to make the motion smooth we multiply that answer by a fraction say 0.2 that gives a speed of seven and this speed reduces as we move the player closer to the boundary of the scroll region nice but we don't like these fraction results so we can drop it all inside a round block to round it off three brilliant pop that in the first change camera Y block now for the scrolling down duplicate the same expression and replace that 100 with 4 yes that is still ne40 and I'm just going to tweak the smoothing value to 0.15 we can play with these values more later on if we want but right now now let's see what a difference this has made and yeah the floor returned into view far quicker that's great now before I move on though it might be worth making double Shore that the level is prevented from scrolling down too far below zero just in case if camera Y is less than zero then we set camera y back to zero again simple so are we done not so fast take a look back at our level costumes where the level moves steadily upwards where do we go from here there's no more room to design a level as we've used up all the space already well that is a bummer right I mean if only this huge sway the floor wasn't taking up like a third of each costume wait a moment are you thinking what I'm thinking if we were to remove this floor perhaps into another Sprite then we'd have all this extra room to play with and perhaps that would be all the extra space we need also as an added perk the new floor Sprite could be used to pimp up our title screen too awesome let's do this we begin then by duplicating the entire level Sprite and move it next to the level and then rename it as floor now making sure we are definitely still in the new floor Sprite we ferociously move all but the First costume all we want is the floor so zoom out and if you drew the top and bottom rectangles to allow for offscreen scrolling then you'll probably agree these are going to cause US problems as they now get scrolled into view by a change of camera y well we can safely delete the bottom one at least but the top one H that's another story we still need it to allow the Sprite scroll off screen so instead we're going to make it invisible yeah that's right bring it down into the center of the canvas and with it selected simply change its fill and outline to transparent and it's gone no it's still there and you can select it by clicking its outline or easier still dragging a selection Marquee over it and boom there it is selected once more so it's coding time we're only using a single costume so remove the switch costume block and since the floor wants to be visible now on the title menu we're going to separate the scripts from under the set camera y they will be run on a green flag in a moment oh yes but when we do reset the level also reset y to zero now when green flag clicked since this is only run the once at project startup we don't need to bother deleting clones or even hiding this Sprite so it's these scripts that remain and can be attached under the when flag clicked block oh wait I see another change costume get rid of that one too and remove the broadcast to game on talking of which when I receive game on will bring this floor right to the front of the level where it belongs and to get the floor scrolling even on the title screen we need to set scroll speed to 10 now this is exciting it's time to smash that green flag and well I can't deny that's a little underwhelming it ain't scrolling oh oh I forgot clicking into the menu Sprite because we've left in the fake floor yes there you are isn't that funky a scrolling floor right from the word go so does the floor work in your game too well apparently it might be but it's hard to tell if the floor is showing since our level also has a floor baked into their costumes too guys we' better take a look click back into the level Sprite yes we are still suffering greatly from abundance of floor and we don't need them anymore take a look at costume one and zooming right out so that we can see everything during this process we're going to not only remove the floors but also any of the red bars so for this costume that's literally everything goodbye and because the floor is in a separate Sprite now this works just fine well almost the lack of red rectangles is causing Scene Three to not appear we'll address that soon enough let's move on to costume two though and this is where it gets a little fiddly so pay attention we remove the floor and any red rectangles remember to be zoomed out for that and now we want to move the rest of the level down to sit on the bottom edge of the canvas that will give us lots of delicious space above to play with but before you rush gungho into dragging costumes around remember that it's very important that each costume remains perfectly lined up across the level not something easy to achieve when dragging these individually by hand so instead select everything you can press control a if you like and then make sure you are at the default Zoom just click the equals button there then while holding the shift key tap the down arrow shift and an arrow will move the selected shapes down by exactly 15 pixels as long as you at the default Zoom okay so repeat this 2 3 counting them off until we reach the bottom of the canvas 7 8 it's best if the level ends up right on the bottom Edge or just below now remember that eight or whatever it was you got because then we need to move on to the next costume and repeat that procedure exactly as before delete the red rectangle angles and the floor and then with all the other shapes selected and at the default Zoom hold shift and tap the down arrow the exact same number of times eight for me this will ensure all our costumes remain perfectly lined up as they were before in our game okay here we are the costumes are fully transposed step two then is to recreate these scrolling rectangles to allow these level Sprites to scroll out of view position wise I'll drop it in just above the canvas making sure it's centered and most importantly that it's wider than the main canvas area too and then we make its fill transparent and the outline too and now the fun bit using the selection tool copy that rectangle and then working your way through each costume in the level pasting that rectangle in place it should appear in the same position each time which is really useful brilliant that's the costumes done but we are not quite out of the woods yet with our costumes lowered down they are of course appearing far too low down the screen in our game too behind the floor Sprite in fact not a problem into the level code we go see over here where we are positioning the Y position of the level Sprite we need to add to that the same amount that we shifted the level costumes down by and that was eight down key presses for me and if you recall each press was worth 15 pixels 8 multiplied by 15 is 120 pixels exactly so whatever your total comes to pop that into the left of this set y position block and we can give it a world oh my word the level returns and it's not looking any the worse for all my tinkering and that that really opens things up for us to expand our level design extensively and here is the fruit of my labor my updated costumes for the start of the stereo Madness level if you want them for reference then well here they are and you can see we certainly needed that extra space in these higher up zones even pushing a little further off the canvas top where necessary oh and this you saw that did you yeah I drew that myself and it's pretty good I thought but your guess is as good as mine as to what it's used for I guess it's got something to do with the next episode shall we check this level out in full and the timing is now a lot better and closer to the original I had to move these stairs closer together otherwise you get out of time and yeah that is a problem it turns out my jump height is a bit too high now to compensate I went in and tweaked the physics of the game increasing Gravity from 4 to 4.3 that will pull the player down just a little bit faster and to match the resulting faster jump increase the rotation to 15° it's not a big change but I think it makes all the difference or my updated level design the player is now synchronized perfectly with the jumps and especially the classic Geometry Dash staircase yeah this is the bee's knees don't ever feel scared to play around with things like this until you get the game just right so guys we are all but ready to wrap up this episode but just before I do we have to fix this glaring problem it happens when we restart mid game make sure you are in the player Sprite and then click the green flag and start the actual game but immediately stop it again before we begin to jump that means the player is flush with the ground and that we can now drag a fresh goto XY block from the pallet to under the when flag clicked script and we are guaranteed now to have the player in just that Sweet Spot while we're at it we might as well also point in Direction 90 so that they are always facing up and that is all there is to it it wow haven't we made some excellent progress today with the new camera tracking and the extra level height to work with our games are surely way cooler and way more fun to play so what's next as promised we'll be adding a new game mode the ship form and guys I'm dead excited about that how about you so if
