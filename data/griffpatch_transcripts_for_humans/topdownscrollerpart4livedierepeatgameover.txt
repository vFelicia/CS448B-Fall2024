00:00 - Highschool patch welcome to the fourth
00:02 - part of my tutorial series on making a
00:04 - top-down scrolling tutorial today we are
00:08 - going to look at how to get these green
00:10 - zombie cubes to actually hurt you and in
00:12 - the game when they touch you so let's
00:14 - get on with app straight away
00:16 - let's go into the player sprite and what
00:21 - we need to do is add in actually before
00:24 - we do that let's disable this M key to
00:29 - add of enemies so when you're not
00:31 - designing levels just detach this let's
00:34 - put an if statement yeah like this this
00:39 - protects us
00:40 - so we'll press M key it's never gonna go
00:42 - and do this not if there's nothing in
00:44 - there so that just protects us from
00:46 - being able to add new enemies by
00:48 - pressing M by mistake any point when you
00:50 - want to add them just pop that down like
00:52 - that then the M key will now run those
00:54 - and Naomi back in there when you don't
00:56 - want it okay so now we protect it from
00:59 - adding them by mistake so duplicate your
01:02 - broadcast here and create a new one and
01:04 - we're going to add a broadcast to check
01:05 - whether we are touching an enemy so
01:07 - that's called new message and we're
01:09 - gonna say touching enemy like that okay
01:15 - last one in the list of broadcasts so
01:18 - let's have a receiver for this
01:21 - when I receive
01:25 - enemy now this is a nice straightforward
01:27 - they've coded in here
01:29 - just have an if and then we want sensing
01:36 - ching mouse pointer no we want to change
01:39 - that to be touching zombie she's the
01:42 - name of the sprite there if we touch a
01:44 - zombie we need to end the game now for
01:48 - that let's create a new available and I
01:51 - will make it for all sprites and I'm
01:55 - going to call it end like that
01:59 - so when we touch a zombie we set end to
02:03 - die like that okay that's all we need in
02:07 - that and now we have this repeat loop
02:11 - here so what we're gonna say is keep
02:14 - repeating until and in there greater
02:19 - than and then we're gonna have end it's
02:23 - greater than and just delete that side
02:25 - don't have anything in it so when end is
02:28 - bigger than nothing then we're going to
02:29 - end and come down here so we need to set
02:33 - end
02:36 - just up here where's we did
02:42 - at the very top end to blank so end is
02:45 - starting as blank and as soon as we
02:49 - touch an enemy and be bigger than blank
02:51 - and will drop out so that should just
02:53 - stop the game it seems to be touch the
02:54 - enemy right now just try that
02:57 - yep game over can't move and is now died
03:02 - okay let's get rid of that end verbal
03:06 - from the view and now we want to do
03:08 - something down here now in my zombie
03:09 - cube game and I touched an enemy I shook
03:11 - the screen so let's do that
03:13 - sit down here let's have an if/else at
03:17 - the end of the air the game loop and
03:20 - we're going to say equals end equals
03:28 - died okay so if ND quiz die we're gonna
03:32 - run this bit of code here that bit of
03:34 - code is going to be a new custom block
03:38 - mate block and it's going to be shake
03:43 - screen and now add in two variables and
03:49 - scroll X and scroll Y like that two
03:55 - parameters now do not run without screen
03:58 - refresh okay keep that block box
04:00 - unticked because we want this to be
04:03 - moving to be shaking the screen when
04:04 - it's in here so we mustn't have it
04:05 - running without screen refresh otherwise
04:07 - it's not going to see it shaking so
04:10 - leave that blank
04:12 - it is keeps maybe my block out of the
04:15 - way okay and we going to add that shake
04:19 - screen to the if condition to say if
04:22 - ends die shake the screen and pass into
04:25 - that our two variables scroll X and
04:29 - scroll Y ok so it's now shaking a screen
04:33 - at the position that we currently are
04:36 - now it's code up a score like scratch
04:39 - shake screen script now let's make this
04:44 - we need a verbal create a variable
04:47 - called eye for this sprite only so it's
04:51 - a little lowercase I
04:52 - and we'll set eye
04:55 - - how much we want it to shake so we
04:58 - want this to shake for say a second so
05:00 - 30 so the 30 shakes is a second because
05:04 - it's 30 frames a second a squid game is
05:06 - running out then we need a repeat
05:12 - and we'll repeat for I think that
05:18 - and what we need to do is set the
05:21 - position of scroll X so small X is where
05:26 - the camera is pointing so if we move the
05:28 - camera around rapidly it'll shape the
05:30 - screen so what you can do in here is
05:33 - position it that now we're using the
05:37 - scroll X from the past in parameter here
05:39 - plus and now this is going to be
05:41 - multiplied we're going to do is I
05:46 - because I starts at 30 so 30 pixels
05:49 - times by a random amount of movement and
05:53 - the random map is going to be 4 minus 1
05:57 - I'm zero to one point zero so any amount
06:01 - between those two values and they're
06:05 - going to do the same scroll wife set to
06:07 - scroll Y to the scroll Y parameter plus
06:13 - I times a random amount so this is going
06:16 - to move it anywhere between minus 30 and
06:19 - 30 because we're timesing by either
06:21 - minus 1 to 1 times by 30 and after we've
06:26 - moved it we're going to broadcast
06:31 - and wait can we
06:35 - Podcast the move level then we're going
06:41 - to change
06:44 - for before the broadcast do a change i
06:48 - buy minus one so as we go through it
06:51 - starts at 30 it goes down and down and
06:53 - down so this amount of shake start big
06:56 - and will get smaller and smaller now we
07:00 - can test with that shake works let's
07:02 - just put a call to shake here and pass
07:05 - in Assam zero by zero so it's in the
07:08 - middle there we go
07:11 - every time I can run that start shaking
07:14 - a lot and then calms down
07:20 - good let's just run that
07:23 - it actually works
07:27 - excellent
07:31 - okay and once it's finished shaking what
07:34 - we really wanted to do is allow us to
07:36 - restart the game so let's move back over
07:39 - here have a look at that what we did let
07:43 - me just remove these scripts across at
07:46 - the moment we've only got one repeat
07:47 - loop here as soon as it ends it shakes
07:52 - the screen and then finishes so we need
07:54 - its loop back and run the game again now
07:57 - our whole loop really should go right to
08:00 - the base start here so let's have a
08:02 - control where ever loop put it around
08:05 - the whole game
08:07 - after it's finished shaking its going to
08:09 - come right back at the top set end knot
08:12 - and opposition to the middle and
08:13 - broadcast set up again which is gonna
08:16 - then start positioning all the zombies
08:18 - now we're gonna be careful there because
08:20 - that's going to create a duplicate of
08:21 - all our zombies because they're zombies
08:22 - we're already on the level so what we
08:24 - need to do is have a tidy up before we
08:26 - will repeat back so it'd be worth having
08:29 - a vent broadcast and wait at the very
08:32 - bottom here just there and we're going
08:35 - to call this reset
08:38 - we broadcast a reset before it goes
08:41 - around again and a reset
08:44 - we need to wipe out all the zombies so
08:47 - let's have a receiver
08:50 - and here when I receive
08:55 - reset and I want to end all the clones
09:00 - so delete this clone just make sure that
09:04 - works
09:05 - so a guy
09:08 - and it resets
09:15 - okay so
09:18 - think we really don't want the game to
09:20 - start as soon as this screen appears
09:22 - what I did in my zombie cube game was
09:25 - have a thing of a bit of text on the
09:26 - screen saying press any key to start and
09:27 - that just gives it a much more
09:29 - professional
09:30 - intro so let's stop this and have a look
09:34 - at how we can do that so in the player
09:36 - sprite here at the moment we set up all
09:39 - of the positioning we broadcast set up
09:41 - and we start the loop so before we start
09:44 - the loop here this is where we want to
09:46 - have the press any key bit so for that
09:51 - let's just move things down a bit so
09:53 - we've got a bit more room
09:55 - scripts always start to balloon a little
09:57 - bit as you'd code these games right so
10:01 - we wanted to have a weight just in here
10:03 - but before we wait we want to make sure
10:05 - everything is drawn on the screen in
10:07 - high position
10:08 - now it's quite easy all we need to do
10:09 - for that it's broadcast more level but
10:11 - let's do in two events and/or a
10:13 - broadcast and wait so just here before
10:18 - we start the game loop you want to
10:20 - broadcast
10:22 - move level that opposition everything on
10:24 - screen right positions and then in here
10:28 - we can have a loop that waits for a key
10:30 - press so if you go down you can have the
10:34 - wait until
10:37 - underneath the move level before we
10:41 - start our game we probably ton till then
10:44 - sensing and let's have a key pressed
10:49 - now you can choose what you put in here
10:51 - you can either have a particular key you
10:52 - want to start the game or you can have
10:54 - any key and I'm going to put in any key
10:57 - for now and as soon as I think it's
11:01 - pressed the game will begin so let's
11:03 - just run that
11:07 - okay so nothing's happening at the
11:10 - moment Prez a key and the game starts
11:14 - now one question is why were none of
11:17 - those cubes visible so we broadcast
11:21 - moved level and that in the zombie
11:26 - script move level now that positions
11:28 - them which sets the is visible or not
11:31 - but it doesn't actually show them that
11:34 - is done in move enemy here so what we
11:37 - need to do is call this move enemy as
11:40 - well as the as the move level so let's
11:42 - add in another broadcast and wait
11:45 - underneath the move level where we call
11:49 - move enemy now let's run that
11:54 - it should there we go that's better so
11:57 - that's the start of the game it's a key
11:59 - and it all begins what we need now is a
12:02 - way of winning the level so next
12:05 - tutorial we're going to just clean up
12:07 - the project and look at how to get a
12:09 - winning game screen with maybe a timer
12:12 - and make fun like that so join me next
12:14 - time thanks for watching this grift
12:16 - match bye now

than and just delete that side don't have anything in it so when end is bigger than nothing then we're going to end and come down here so we need to set end just up here where's we did at the very top end to blank so end is starting as blank and as soon as we touch an enemy and be bigger than blank and will drop out so that should just stop the game it seems to be touch the enemy right now just try that yep game over can't move and is now died okay let's get rid of that end verbal from the view and now we want to do something down here now in my zombie cube game and I touched an enemy I shook the screen so let's do that sit down here let's have an if/else at the end of the air the game loop and we're going to say equals end equals died okay so if ND quiz die we're gonna run this bit of

without screen refresh okay keep that block box unticked because we want this to be moving to be shaking the screen when it's in here so we mustn't have it running without screen refresh otherwise it's not going to see it shaking so leave that blank it is keeps maybe my block out of the way okay and we going to add that shake screen to the if condition to say if ends die shake the screen and pass into that our two variables scroll X and scroll Y ok so it's now shaking a screen at the position that we currently are now it's code up a score like scratch shake screen script now let's make this we need a verbal create a variable called eye for this sprite only so it's a little lowercase I and we'll set eye how much we want it to shake so we want this to shake for say a second so 30 so the 30 shakes is a second because it's 30 frames a second a squid game is running out then we need a repeat and we'll repeat for I think that and what we need to do is set the position of scroll X so small X is where the camera is pointing so if we move the camera around rapidly it'll shape the screen so what you can do in here is position it that now we're using the scroll X from the past in

we're going to change for before the broadcast do a change i buy minus one so as we go through it starts at 30 it goes down and down and down so this amount of shake start big and will get smaller and smaller now we can test with that shake works let's just put a call to shake here and pass in Assam zero by zero so it's in the middle there we go every time I can run that start shaking a lot and
