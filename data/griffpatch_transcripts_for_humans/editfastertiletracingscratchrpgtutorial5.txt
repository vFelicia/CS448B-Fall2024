00:00 - foreign
00:03 - scratchers this is episode 5 of our
00:06 - amazing tutorial coding a Zelda style
00:08 - RPG in scratch and today we are covering
00:11 - some awesome topics split screen
00:14 - scrolling drawing two independent
00:16 - scrolling areas in a scratch project is
00:19 - tricky without leaving that thick border
00:22 - between them to get around this we'd
00:24 - need scratch support clip regions and it
00:28 - doesn't but if we limit the pallet tiles
00:31 - to scroll a tile at a time then we can
00:34 - get around this issue next we'll add
00:37 - keyboard control over the scrolling of
00:39 - the tile palette but rather than having
00:41 - yet another set of controls for both the
00:44 - level and the palette we'll use the
00:46 - mouse cursor to capture the editor focus
00:49 - when the mouse is over the left the keys
00:51 - control the level but when the mouse is
00:53 - over the right the pallet the keys
00:55 - control that instead very efficient and
00:59 - finally I'm super excited about this one
01:02 - Sprite sheet tracing where holding down
01:05 - the space key locks the movement of the
01:08 - editor and the palette cursors moving
01:10 - them in unison and allowing us to easily
01:13 - Trace large multi-costume structures
01:15 - into our Maps that's cool right so stay
01:20 - tuned to the end for that what are we
01:23 - waiting for guys let's get scratching we
01:27 - begin with our projects form episode 4
01:30 - and as always take the time to save your
01:32 - project as a new copy for this is RPG
01:36 - episode five right let's get this right
01:41 - hand palette scrolling click into the
01:43 - tile Sprite
01:45 - just like how we have a Chemex and Y for
01:48 - scrolling the main game map now we need
01:50 - similar variables for the palette make a
01:53 - new variable palette DX for this Sprite
01:57 - only and while we're at it make it into
01:59 - a slider on the stage
02:02 - then create another variable palette d y
02:06 - for this Sprite only
02:08 - and make it a slider too
02:10 - we'll start by making the palette slide
02:13 - to the right
02:14 - the palette drawing code is called from
02:16 - here the paint palette so find that
02:19 - custom block
02:23 - and yeah we begin painting tile number
02:26 - 20 set gdix to 20 here
02:30 - scroll it right we just add palette DX
02:33 - to this
02:36 - make sure the project is running
02:40 - and yeah that was easy so what about the
02:44 - palette d y
02:45 - we'll need to add that to the gidx again
02:49 - but as with all grid lists to move up
02:52 - and down we must multiply the Y palette
02:55 - d y by the number of tiles in a row and
02:59 - for this palette that is 18. okay so sum
03:03 - that all together
03:07 - and
03:09 - success we finally have access to all
03:12 - those nice costumes what fun and there's
03:15 - so many hey look here's a nice bed
03:17 - anyway you get the general idea
03:21 - now to make the panel scroll using the
03:24 - keyboard the main game world is
03:27 - controlled using the curse keys or wsd
03:29 - but if we are clever detecting which
03:32 - side of the screen the mouse is over we
03:34 - could switch the same keys to scroll the
03:37 - right hand tile Palette too we just need
03:39 - to know which side has the focus
03:42 - right scroll over to the when I receive
03:45 - paint background
03:47 - we'll make a new variable
03:49 - Focus palette
03:52 - for this Sprite only and before we check
03:55 - if we are in the editor set Focus
03:57 - palette to the empty value
04:00 - but then when we begin painting the
04:03 - editor here I'm using scratch add-ons
04:06 - devtools extension to quickly jump to
04:08 - the custom block
04:10 - paint palette
04:12 - we can add an if block after setting the
04:15 - palette width and check whether Mouse X
04:18 - is greater than
04:22 - 240 that's the right edge of the screen
04:25 - subtract the palette width
04:29 - great we know the mouse is over the tile
04:32 - panel so make a new custom block naming
04:36 - it scroll panel
04:38 - run without screen refresh
04:42 - and drop that into the new if
04:47 - for starters let's just set Focus
04:49 - palette to one
04:57 - then let's quickly test this is working
04:59 - fine and as I hover over the tile
05:01 - palette the focus variable toggles to
05:04 - one
05:05 - brilliant so click into the player
05:08 - Sprite and we'll use this to disable the
05:10 - player motion
05:12 - we'll find this in the when I receive
05:15 - tick player script we have a Joy X and
05:18 - joy y variable to represent our controls
05:21 - but do you notice how we don't move the
05:24 - player unless Joy dist is greater than
05:26 - zero we can use this fact come into the
05:30 - player controls custom block
05:33 - and where we set Joy dist surround it
05:36 - with an if else block
05:38 - with an equals comparator
05:41 - and we want the value of our new Focus
05:43 - palette variable so using the sensing
05:46 - thing of thing block
05:48 - for the tile Sprite
05:50 - select the focus palette variable
05:54 - and we compare it to the empty value
05:57 - great so when the focus palette is not
06:00 - set we continue as normal setting the
06:03 - joy dist but if the focus palette is set
06:06 - just set joydist to nothing that will
06:10 - disable the player movement
06:13 - we can test that out and confirm that as
06:16 - soon as the mouse is over the editor
06:18 - tile palette the player can no longer be
06:20 - moved with the keyboard that works
06:23 - perfectly great work click back into the
06:26 - tile Sprite and we'll activate the keys
06:28 - to scroll this area instead
06:32 - drag in a change palette DX by and we
06:36 - need that Joy X variable from the player
06:39 - Sprite so use that sensing thing of
06:42 - thing block again with the player Sprite
06:45 - and choose Joy X we can drop that right
06:50 - in here and give that a test with the
06:52 - mouse over the palette wow this Scrolls
06:55 - really fast too fast anyhow it works and
07:00 - when the mouse is over the game that
07:02 - Scrolls instead that's really cool I
07:05 - love that now we code the up and down
07:08 - scrolling 2. this time we need a change
07:11 - palette d y and of course changing the
07:14 - joy y
07:15 - however be careful here because you'll
07:18 - find that scrolling is inverted
07:21 - scrolling up in the game Scrolls us down
07:24 - in the palette with the same key why is
07:27 - that because we began drawing the tiles
07:31 - in the palette from the top and we work
07:33 - down but the level starts at the bottom
07:36 - and works up typical anyhow we just need
07:40 - to invert this Movement by subtracting
07:43 - Joy y from zero
07:45 - and now ah sweet order is restored cool
07:51 - but aren't we scrolling up a bit too far
07:53 - it should most certainly stop when we
07:56 - hit the top of the pallet tiles we need
07:58 - to fence it in now you've seen this all
08:00 - before if palette DX is less than zero
08:05 - then set palette DX
08:08 - 2-0
08:09 - and now the palette cannot go further
08:11 - left than zero
08:16 - do the same for palette d y
08:19 - setting Dy back to zero
08:23 - that sorts are scrolling past the top of
08:26 - the costumes
08:28 - next up the far extends the right and
08:31 - down
08:32 - if palette DX is greater than
08:36 - and then we need to subtract
08:38 - and I have 18 tiles in each row so pop
08:43 - that in there and we subtract from that
08:45 - the palette width of five tiles
08:48 - if we exceed this we set the palette DX
08:51 - back to yeah the same value 18 subtract
08:54 - 5. now we are restricted from scrolling
08:57 - too far to the right perfect one more to
09:01 - go
09:02 - if palette d y is greater than
09:10 - and set palette d y you know the value
09:12 - to use just enter 19. that's the right
09:16 - values for my tile set you can scroll
09:19 - down and check the current palette Dy to
09:21 - find the best values for you and this
09:23 - one seems great for me right now
09:26 - we'll address this more though later on
09:29 - okay I'm feeling pretty good that we're
09:32 - nicely fenced in and can see all the
09:34 - tiles what I don't like is that the
09:37 - panel Scrolls so fast there are so many
09:40 - ways I could fix this but to be more
09:43 - generally useful I'll add a tick timer
09:44 - into the player Sprite so click into
09:47 - there now
09:49 - then make a variable named tick this
09:53 - time for all Sprites
09:56 - we'll set it to zero in the green flag
09:58 - script
10:00 - and then when I receive tick player
10:04 - we change tick by one that will now
10:08 - serve as a quick reference to how many
10:10 - game ticks have passed since the project
10:12 - started
10:14 - and if we click back into the tile
10:16 - Sprite we can add an if Clause after
10:20 - setting the focus palette to 1 and check
10:22 - this tick variable
10:25 - I want to only allow scrolling every
10:27 - other tick use a greater than
10:30 - and a mod block
10:33 - if we mod tick by two then it will cycle
10:36 - between 0 and 1 each game frame so if
10:40 - it's greater than zero then we can stop
10:42 - this script and that prevents it running
10:45 - every other frame that should slow it
10:48 - down by half let's give that a test
10:51 - there we go so what do you think of the
10:55 - speed I'd say that's just about right
10:58 - now before we move on hide all those
11:01 - available reported variables to clear
11:03 - the Clutter
11:05 - so guys we can happily access any tile
11:09 - from our palette and begin laying them
11:10 - down into the game but the process of
11:13 - building up large multi-tile assets like
11:16 - this house is rather time consuming this
11:19 - is where we need to bring out the big
11:21 - guns and implement the Uber cool tile
11:24 - tracing feature yeah how this works is
11:28 - as soon as we press the space key we
11:31 - record the current grid position of the
11:33 - mouse on the map
11:35 - we'll call this drag X and drag y then
11:39 - when the mouse moves in any direction we
11:42 - can detect how far it moved and
11:44 - replicate that relative movement in the
11:47 - tile palette and ta-da we have our newly
11:51 - selected brush we can then update drag X
11:54 - and drag y to the new position and
11:57 - repeat the process again this shouldn't
11:59 - be so hard right
12:01 - so let's begin by finding the defined
12:04 - paint editor script this is where we are
12:07 - calculating the grid tile the mouse is
12:09 - over g x g y and also gidx2 separate
12:14 - these off and we'll put these in a new
12:17 - custom block
12:18 - naming it calculate brush position and
12:22 - run without screen refresh
12:24 - those three set blocks can go in there
12:26 - and drop the new calculate block where
12:29 - that came from
12:31 - the start of the drag begins when the
12:34 - space key is pressed if else
12:38 - checking for the space key
12:40 - okay to record the drag start position
12:43 - we make two new variables
12:47 - drag X for this Sprite only
12:52 - and drag y also for this Sprite only
12:57 - then set drag X to
13:00 - the current grid X of the mouse that's
13:03 - GX
13:04 - and likewise drag y
13:09 - to gy
13:11 - then when the space key is not pressed
13:13 - we reset these variables setting them
13:15 - both to the empty value
13:20 - cool if we run that you should find that
13:24 - when we hold down space we get the grid
13:27 - position appearing in the drag X and Y
13:28 - variable reporters here and when you
13:31 - release the space key the values
13:33 - disappear perfect
13:36 - so now we want to look for changes in
13:39 - drag positions bring in an if block
13:41 - putting it before the set drag X and Y
13:45 - right at the top here
13:47 - and we check if drag X is greater than
13:51 - the empty value
13:53 - so if we look at this the first time you
13:56 - press down the space key the drag X will
13:58 - be empty and so all we do is skip this
14:01 - if and set the drag X and Y variables
14:03 - but the next tick of our game we come in
14:06 - here again and we are still holding down
14:09 - the space key so drag X and Y will now
14:11 - have been set to the previous grid
14:13 - position
14:14 - but GX and gy are the current grid
14:18 - positions now they might have changed so
14:21 - if these are different then we can move
14:24 - our palette selection by the same
14:26 - difference
14:27 - so change brush that's our selected
14:30 - palette costume by the difference
14:31 - between drag X and GX that is GX
14:35 - subtract drag X
14:41 - now that is simple right that can't
14:44 - possibly work can it let's give it a
14:46 - shot first off we hold down space and
14:50 - try moving the mouse left and right and
14:52 - wow would you look at that it really was
14:55 - that simple
14:57 - now try holding space and then clicking
14:59 - the mouse down to paint the tiles too
15:02 - yeah that is beautiful I love that of
15:07 - course since we didn't yet include that
15:09 - drag why this doesn't yet work for up
15:12 - and down let's do that next
15:15 - duplicate the change brush only switch
15:18 - the GX for a g y and the drag X for a
15:23 - drag y That's not quite all though as
15:27 - you might expect every vertical movement
15:29 - in the grid space needs multiplying by
15:31 - the grid width or in this case the
15:33 - palette width
15:35 - and that is negative 18. mustn't forget
15:39 - that palette is flipped
15:41 - giving that test now
15:43 - and that is looking Sweet let's try that
15:48 - on a large house now
15:52 - oh yes very cool what else can we try
15:55 - how about a tree
15:58 - I'll just plonk it down by this pathway
16:01 - ah okay so that is so cool but did you
16:05 - see how the tree has replaced the nice
16:08 - edge of this path why is that because we
16:12 - still can only place one tile in each
16:14 - grid cell well one tile and the
16:17 - background grass anyway
16:19 - to fix this we will need to extend our
16:22 - tile engine further to support layers of
16:25 - tiles but rather than rushing into this
16:28 - now let's draw things to a close here
16:30 - and we can look forward to adding the
16:32 - tile layering in a very exciting episode
16:34 - six well I hope you enjoyed this video

Cleaned transcript:

foreign scratchers this is episode 5 of our amazing tutorial coding a Zelda style RPG in scratch and today we are covering some awesome topics split screen scrolling drawing two independent scrolling areas in a scratch project is tricky without leaving that thick border between them to get around this we'd need scratch support clip regions and it doesn't but if we limit the pallet tiles to scroll a tile at a time then we can get around this issue next we'll add keyboard control over the scrolling of the tile palette but rather than having yet another set of controls for both the level and the palette we'll use the mouse cursor to capture the editor focus when the mouse is over the left the keys control the level but when the mouse is over the right the pallet the keys control that instead very efficient and finally I'm super excited about this one Sprite sheet tracing where holding down the space key locks the movement of the editor and the palette cursors moving them in unison and allowing us to easily Trace large multicostume structures into our Maps that's cool right so stay tuned to the end for that what are we waiting for guys let's get scratching we begin with our projects form episode 4 and as always take the time to save your project as a new copy for this is RPG episode five right let's get this right hand palette scrolling click into the tile Sprite just like how we have a Chemex and Y for scrolling the main game map now we need similar variables for the palette make a new variable palette DX for this Sprite only and while we're at it make it into a slider on the stage then create another variable palette d y for this Sprite only and make it a slider too we'll start by making the palette slide to the right the palette drawing code is called from here the paint palette so find that custom block and yeah we begin painting tile number 20 set gdix to 20 here scroll it right we just add palette DX to this make sure the project is running and yeah that was easy so what about the palette d y we'll need to add that to the gidx again but as with all grid lists to move up and down we must multiply the Y palette d y by the number of tiles in a row and for this palette that is 18. okay so sum that all together and success we finally have access to all those nice costumes what fun and there's so many hey look here's a nice bed anyway you get the general idea now to make the panel scroll using the keyboard the main game world is controlled using the curse keys or wsd but if we are clever detecting which side of the screen the mouse is over we could switch the same keys to scroll the right hand tile Palette too we just need to know which side has the focus right scroll over to the when I receive paint background we'll make a new variable Focus palette

quickly jump to the custom block paint palette we can add an if block after setting the palette width and check whether Mouse X is greater than 240 that's the right edge of the screen subtract the palette width great we know the mouse is over the tile panel so make a new custom block naming it scroll panel run without screen refresh and drop that into the new if for starters let's just set Focus palette to one then let's quickly test this is working fine and as I hover over the tile palette the focus variable toggles to one brilliant so click into the player Sprite and we'll use this to disable the player motion we'll find this in the when I receive tick player script we have a Joy X and joy y variable to represent our controls but do you notice how we don't move the player unless Joy dist is greater than zero we can use this fact come into the player controls custom block and where we set Joy dist surround it with an if else block with an equals comparator and we want the value of our new Focus palette variable so using the sensing thing of thing block for the tile Sprite select the focus palette variable and we compare it to the empty value great so when the focus palette is not set we continue as normal setting the joy dist but if the focus palette is set just set joydist to nothing that will disable the player movement we can test that out and confirm that as soon as the mouse is over the editor tile palette the player can no longer be moved with the keyboard that works perfectly great work click back into the tile Sprite and we'll activate the keys to scroll this area instead drag in a change palette DX by and we need that Joy X variable from the player Sprite so use that sensing thing of thing block again with the player Sprite and choose Joy X we can drop that right in here and give that a test with the mouse over the palette wow this Scrolls really fast too fast anyhow it works and when the mouse is over the game that Scrolls instead that's really cool I love that now we code the up and down scrolling 2. this time we need a change palette d y and of course changing the joy y however be careful here because you'll find that scrolling is inverted scrolling up in the game Scrolls us down in the palette with the same key why is that because we began drawing the tiles in the palette from the top and we work down but the level starts at the bottom and works up typical anyhow we just need to invert this Movement by subtracting Joy y from zero and now ah sweet order is restored cool but aren't we scrolling up a bit too far it should most certainly stop when we hit the top of the pallet tiles we need to fence it in now you've seen this all before if palette DX is less than zero then set palette DX 20 and now the palette cannot go further left than zero do the same for palette d y setting Dy back to zero that sorts are scrolling past the top of the costumes next up the far extends the right and down if palette DX is greater than and then we need to subtract and I have 18 tiles in each row so pop that in there and we subtract from that the palette width of five tiles if we exceed this we set the palette DX back to yeah the same value 18 subtract 5. now we are restricted from scrolling too far to the right perfect one more to go if palette d y is greater than and set palette d y you know the value to use just enter 19. that's the right values for my tile set you can scroll down and check the current palette Dy to find the best values for you and this one seems great for me right now we'll address this more though later on okay I'm feeling pretty good that we're nicely fenced in and can see all the tiles what I don't like is that the panel Scrolls so fast there are so many ways I could fix this but to be

will cycle between 0 and 1 each game frame so if it's greater than zero then we can stop this script and that prevents it running every other frame that should slow it down by half let's give that a test there we go so what do you think of the speed I'd say that's just about right now before we move on hide all those available reported variables to clear the Clutter so guys we can happily access any tile from our palette and begin laying them down into the game but the process of building up large multitile assets like this house is rather time consuming this is where we need to bring out the

grid tile the mouse is over g x g y and also gidx2 separate these off and we'll put these in a new custom block naming it calculate brush position and run without screen refresh those three set blocks can go in there and drop the new calculate block where that came from the start of the drag begins when the space key is pressed if else checking for the space key okay to record the drag start

and Y variable reporters here and when you release the space key the values disappear perfect so now we want to look for changes in drag positions bring in an if block putting it before the set drag X and Y right at the top here and we check if drag X is greater than the empty value so if we look at this the first time you press down the space key the drag X will be empty and so all we do is skip this if and set the drag X and Y variables but the next tick of our game we come in here again and we are still holding down the space key so drag X and Y will now have been set to the previous grid position but GX and gy are the current grid positions now they might have changed so if these are different then we can move our palette selection by the same difference so change brush that's our selected palette costume by the difference between drag X and GX that is GX subtract drag X now that is simple right that can't possibly work can it let's give it a shot first off we hold down space and try moving the mouse left and right and wow would you look at that it really was that simple now try holding space and then clicking the mouse down to paint the tiles too yeah that is beautiful I love that of course since we didn't yet include that drag why this doesn't yet work for up and down let's do that next duplicate the change brush only switch the GX for a g y and the drag X for a drag y That's not quite all though as you might expect every vertical movement in the grid space needs multiplying by the grid width or in this case the palette width and that is negative 18. mustn't forget that palette is flipped giving that test now and that is looking Sweet let's try that on a large house now oh yes very cool what else can we try how about a tree I'll just plonk it down by this pathway ah okay so that is so cool but did you see how the tree has replaced the nice edge of this path why is that because we still can only place one tile in each grid cell well one tile and the background grass anyway to fix this we will need to extend our tile engine further to support layers of tiles but rather than rushing into this now let's draw things to a close here and we can look forward to adding the tile layering in a very exciting episode six well I hope you enjoyed this video if you did then please click the like button to show your appreciation and that means a lot as it
