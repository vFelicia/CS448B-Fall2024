00:02 - hello fellow scratch bug squishers for a
00:05 - few episodes of our classic platformer
00:07 - series i've been getting reports of a
00:09 - bug cropping up in the wall jumping code
00:12 - every now and again i've seen it too
00:13 - wait there did you see how many of you
00:16 - have seen this in your projects too yep
00:18 - once you know how to exploit it it can
00:20 - be a real game breaker and it's way
00:23 - overdue every visit to put a stop to
00:25 - this madness
00:27 - but wait right there if we are going to
00:29 - do this we should do it officially and
00:31 - we'll therefore break this up into five
00:34 - bug fixing phases are you ready
00:37 - phase one bug reproduction or repro for
00:40 - short before we can fix a bug it's
00:43 - vitally important to first be able to
00:45 - consistently reproduce the issue over
00:47 - and over again hopefully at will
00:50 - gather as much information as you can
00:52 - from the hints left in comments from
00:54 - fellow scratchers and then try to
00:56 - replicate it yourself
00:57 - in our case the main factors appear to
00:59 - be that while we are wall sliding we are
01:01 - then somehow able to jump back up the
01:03 - wall
01:04 - however just what steps this takes are
01:07 - not super clear so i put the tried and
01:09 - tested approach of wildly mashing my
01:11 - keyboard into practice
01:13 - aha i have a repro
01:15 - now i just need to work out exactly what
01:18 - i just did and then hopefully ensure it
01:20 - is consistently reproducible
01:23 - oh yeah i got it yeah
01:26 - yeah this is most certainly it wow i
01:29 - could really get to places with this bug
01:31 - that should be completely out of reach
01:33 - oh it's actually too fun but we've got
01:36 - to fix this really yeah we do do we
01:40 - seriously it breaks the game dude so we
01:42 - now proceed on to phase two the
01:45 - documenting phase this is where we list
01:47 - the steps that cause the bug so that
01:49 - anyone who follows them can reproduce
01:51 - the same issue this is mega important as
01:54 - later on we will need to be able to
01:56 - follow the same steps to confirm that
01:58 - the bug is fixed
01:59 - so we jump against a wall
02:02 - this triggers a wall slide
02:04 - now while still sliding down the wall we
02:06 - pull away by pressing the right arrow
02:08 - key
02:09 - and there did you see it i'll rewind and
02:11 - slow the video down
02:15 - there for one single frame our player is
02:18 - facing the wrong direction and now we
02:21 - immediately mash the jump key and then
02:23 - boing back up the wall we go
02:26 - so with these steps recorded we have an
02:28 - easy to reproduce bug report nice work
02:32 - phase three understanding why the bug
02:35 - occurs
02:36 - in our case we can start by asking why
02:39 - we ended up facing the wrong direction
02:41 - after pulling away from the wall
02:43 - well firstly we have to remember that
02:45 - when we jump against a wall we enter
02:47 - wall slide mode and importantly appear
02:50 - to turn around to face the opposite
02:51 - direction as we slide
02:53 - now if you look in the costumes you'll
02:56 - see that the wall slide costume actually
02:58 - points in the opposite direction to all
03:00 - the other costumes yeah so when wall's
03:03 - sliding we don't actually turn the
03:04 - sprite around at all the player is still
03:07 - facing towards the wall
03:09 - only the costume is flipped to face the
03:11 - other way
03:12 - but as we press the right arrow to pull
03:15 - away from the wall our player's
03:16 - direction is changed to face right
03:19 - it just so happens that the wall slide
03:21 - persists for just the briefest of
03:24 - moments and so the wall slide costume
03:26 - appears facing left oops
03:30 - so is this important well if our game
03:33 - thinks we are still wall sliding then we
03:35 - have a tiny but very exploitable
03:37 - opportunity to perform a wall jump just
03:40 - after leaving the wall but while facing
03:42 - the wrong way and that
03:45 - that is exactly the problem we are
03:47 - seeing splendid sherlock would be proud
03:50 - and we enter phase four where we get to
03:53 - actually fix this bug
03:55 - i feel that if we simply cancel the wall
03:58 - slide as soon as we change direction
04:00 - then the following wall jump exploit
04:02 - will just go away
04:04 - so to the code ensure that we are in the
04:07 - player sprite
04:09 - and find the define controls left and
04:12 - right script
04:14 - this as the name implies is all about
04:16 - handling the left and right controls
04:19 - the first if checks for when we are not
04:21 - pressing the left or right so key x is
04:23 - zero but what we are really interested
04:26 - in is below this within the else branch
04:29 - right here we go see this pointing
04:31 - direction block this is where we make
04:34 - the player face the direction being
04:35 - pressed
04:37 - now we only want to cancel this wall
04:38 - slide if the direction
04:40 - changes so we'll pop in an if block
04:44 - before we actually set the new direction
04:46 - just here
04:47 - make sure to move the point in direction
04:49 - and change frames blocks below this new
04:51 - if
04:53 - now to detect when a change is about to
04:55 - occur we can compare the current
04:56 - direction with the new direction
04:59 - if they are different that is not
05:03 - equal
05:04 - then we can cancel the wall slide
05:06 - the current direction can go on the left
05:09 - and the new direction is given just
05:11 - below in the point direction block key x
05:14 - multiplied by 90. so duplicate that in
05:16 - here
05:18 - excellent now we know when the direction
05:20 - is changing all we need to do now is
05:22 - cancel the wall slide bring in a set
05:25 - block
05:26 - and set wall slide
05:29 - to zero
05:30 - easy peasy when you know what you are
05:33 - doing
05:34 - right that brings us to the final phase
05:36 - of our bug fixing exercise phase 5 the
05:39 - testing phase to know whether the bug is
05:42 - completely gone we simply go over the
05:43 - exact same repro steps we originally
05:46 - documented in phase two
05:48 - if these steps no longer result in the
05:49 - same bug then by jove it means we've
05:51 - done our job and the bug is fixed so
05:54 - here goes nothing
05:56 - jump and slide
05:58 - pull away
05:59 - first impressions are good i didn't spot
06:01 - the player facing the wrong way this
06:03 - time
06:04 - so let's go full hog and try the wall
06:06 - jump back up the wall
06:08 - i'm trying
06:10 - i really am but no matter what i do
06:13 - nope
06:14 - no
06:15 - nope i cannot do it captain
06:18 - bug squashed
06:21 - excellent
06:22 - okay did i say there was only five
06:25 - phases yeah this is the unofficial sixth
06:27 - phase the jumping around party
06:29 - celebration phase
06:31 - right then that is it for this mini bug
06:33 - fixing video i hope you enjoyed the
06:35 - process those who want more don't worry
06:38 - the official episode 12 will be coming
06:40 - out next week and what i have planned is
06:43 - just so super cool rotating platforms
06:46 - yes as showcased in my mmo platformer i
06:49 - know right these are sweet and you just
06:51 - don't see them in scratch projects so i
06:53 - am so excited if you can't wait to get
06:56 - them too then you might want to consider
06:58 - joining my early access membership for
06:59 - the chance to catch it before everyone
07:02 - else
07:03 - okay you know the drill don't forget to
07:05 - love the video subscribe to the channel
07:07 - if you haven't already and until next
07:08 - time have a great week ahead and scratch
07:12 - on guys
07:20 - bye

hello fellow scratch bug squishers for a few episodes of our classic platformer series i've been getting reports of a bug cropping up in the wall jumping code every now and again i've seen it too wait

remember that when we jump against a wall we enter wall slide mode and importantly appear to turn around to face the opposite direction as we slide now if you look in the costumes you'll see that the wall slide costume actually points in the opposite direction to all the other costumes yeah so when wall's sliding we don't actually turn the sprite around at all the player is still facing towards the wall only the costume is flipped to face the other way but as we press the right arrow to pull away from the wall our player's direction is changed to face right it just so happens that the wall slide persists for just the briefest of moments and so the wall slide costume appears facing left oops so is this important well if our game thinks we are still wall sliding then we have a tiny but very exploitable opportunity to perform a wall jump just after leaving the wall but while facing the wrong way and that that is exactly the problem we are seeing splendid sherlock would be proud and we enter phase four where we get to actually fix this bug i feel that if we simply cancel the wall slide as soon as we change direction then the following wall jump exploit will just go away so to the

duplicate that in here excellent now we know when the direction is changing all we need to do now is cancel the wall slide bring in a set block and set wall slide to zero easy peasy when you know what you are doing right that brings us to the final phase of our bug fixing exercise phase 5 the testing phase to know whether the bug is completely gone we simply go over the exact same repro steps we
