00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - hello fellow scratchers we had a lot of
00:04 - fun adding the ship mode in last week's
00:07 - episode of our exciting Geometry Dash
00:09 - series and today we are going to finish
00:11 - the job in classic Geometry Dash when
00:14 - entering a portal the vertical scrolling
00:16 - level changes to become a sort of tunnel
00:19 - with a floor and ceiling and the
00:21 - position of this tunnel is centered
00:22 - around the portal that we last passed
00:24 - through so we are going to need some
00:27 - clever scrips to determine the vertical
00:29 - position of a portal on our level we'll
00:32 - need a new ceiling Sprite and we'll need
00:34 - to fix the vertical scrolling perfectly
00:36 - in place no problem we'll be doing this
00:40 - and More in today's episode so what are
00:43 - we waiting for load up your projects
00:45 - from episode 7 and we'll save them as a
00:48 - fresh new copy for this is episode 8
00:53 - guys let's get
00:56 - scratching now before we dive into
00:59 - adding these fantastic new features
01:01 - let's quickly address two little bugs
01:03 - that you may have experienced from the
01:05 - last episode yeah a lot of you noticed
01:08 - that we started to get excessive
01:10 - particles when starting our first game
01:13 - whoops even when jumping through the air
01:16 - now but as soon as we die and we start
01:19 - the particles go back to
01:21 - normal this little buglet was introduced
01:24 - in the player Sprite under the green
01:26 - flag script this forever Loop to
01:29 - generate tit screen particles needs to
01:31 - be stopped when the game begins not just
01:34 - on death so a simple fix when I receive
01:38 - reset level we stop other scripts in
01:42 - Sprite and that's it give that a run and
01:46 - all is well again no more particles
01:48 - while we're
01:50 - jumping now the second issue wasn't as
01:53 - widely reported and you have to be quick
01:55 - to see it I'm going to place the ship
01:57 - portal at the start of the level once
01:58 - more to show you
02:00 - now watch what happens when we
02:03 - die did you see it look
02:10 - closer yeah we are turning back into the
02:13 - cube costume so how many of you noticed
02:16 - that one if you did then comment saw
02:18 - that bug under the video and better
02:20 - still comment bug squashed if you have
02:23 - already fixed it right I'll show you how
02:26 - I do it scroll down with me to the game
02:28 - on script and look at the forever
02:31 - Loop When We Touch pale yellow that's
02:34 - our spikes then we broadcast game over
02:37 - and we end this forever Loop but that's
02:40 - before we set the rotation style and
02:42 - costume back to mode so duplicate those
02:47 - two blocks and then bring them downwards
02:49 - to our game over scripts and here we are
02:54 - switching costumes not to mode but to
02:57 - cube this is the culprit we remove moove
03:00 - the old switch costume and we'll replace
03:03 - it with the rotation and switch costume
03:05 - block from
03:06 - above nice it's testing time smash that
03:10 - green flag and
03:12 - now bug
03:14 - squashed great
03:17 - job and so we can commence with the meat
03:20 - of this episode creating that horizontal
03:23 - ship mode tunnel now when we're
03:26 - designing our levels we can place our
03:28 - portals at any height
03:30 - however when the player enters it the
03:32 - level is scrolled vertically so that the
03:34 - portal is perfectly centered on the
03:37 - screen from now on our camera is locked
03:41 - to a horizontal
03:43 - rail our problem then is finding that y
03:46 - value of this
03:48 - rail what I suggest is that on touching
03:51 - the portal we switch to use a new hitbox
03:54 - costume that we can slide down the
03:57 - screen until it no longer touches that
03:59 - port portal
04:00 - color now we know where the portal ends
04:03 - the bottom of the portal we can easily
04:05 - calculate its Center too and we'll store
04:08 - that result in a new variable rail
04:11 - y well then let's make that new variable
04:15 - right away rail Y and it's for all
04:19 - Sprites now we should make sure to reset
04:22 - it in the green flag script setting rail
04:25 - y to the empty value however I'll
04:30 - duplicate it as we're going to need two
04:32 - of these one when the project
04:35 - starts and the other right down here in
04:39 - the game on script so it resets each
04:42 - time the level
04:44 - Starts Now to detecting the center of
04:46 - the portal we'll need that new hitbox
04:49 - costume duplicate the first hitbox and
04:53 - we'll name the new one hitbox portal to
04:57 - ensure it stays in contact with the
04:59 - rounded portal right to the very bottom
05:02 - we need it to be relatively wide so hold
05:05 - down the ALT key and stretch it sideways
05:08 - to a width of
05:10 - 72 then move it downwards while holding
05:14 - shift to keep it centered until its top
05:17 - is level with the center of the costume
05:19 - canvas just there good now we can script
05:23 - this
05:24 - up find the Define check portal
05:28 - script
05:31 - now just for a moment I'm going to
05:33 - separate off the existing three blocks
05:35 - from within here as they want to happen
05:38 - last and we switch to the new hitbox
05:41 - portal costume to do our detection
05:44 - sweep we are repeating until we are no
05:48 - longer that is not touching the portal
05:53 - color but until then we move down change
05:57 - y by negative 2
06:01 - pixels okay we should now be clear of
06:04 - the portal let's record the position
06:07 - with a set rail Y
06:10 - 2 and we'll need a couple of addition
06:15 - blocks the middle of the portal is
06:17 - located at the current y position of the
06:20 - hitbox plus 50 that's half the portal
06:25 - height and finally add to that the
06:28 - current camera y value that we are
06:30 - already scrolled to perfect we found the
06:35 - center of the portal so return those
06:38 - previous scripts to the end of this
06:40 - if but hold on having moved the hit box
06:44 - down to the bottom of the portal our
06:46 - player will now be out of position we
06:49 - need to restore them back up to where
06:50 - they were before luckily that's exactly
06:54 - why we added the player y input here so
06:58 - set the player's y position back to the
07:00 - player y
07:02 - input nice and also we need to switch
07:05 - the costume back to the hitbox spike
07:07 - costume
07:08 - too so does this work let's find out hit
07:13 - that green flag and head for the portal
07:17 - 27 huh well that does sound about right
07:20 - since the portal is close to the middle
07:21 - of the screen already and subsequent
07:24 - attempts all come in with values roughly
07:26 - around the same Mark so that's good
07:30 - our next job is to scroll our level to
07:32 - the value in our rail y variable so can
07:36 - you find the defined camera tracking
07:40 - script we only want to change this when
07:42 - we are on a camera rail so if else
07:46 - inserted after setting the last camera
07:49 - Y and what we're going to check is if
07:51 - rail Y is greater
07:54 - than if rail Y is greater than the empty
07:58 - value then all these original cameras
08:01 - tracking scripts can be placed in the
08:03 - else Branch that's what we do when we're
08:05 - not on the rail but if we are on a
08:09 - camera rail then it's very simple
08:11 - duplicate one of those change camera y
08:14 - blocks and remove the Y
08:17 - position so we want to scroll the camera
08:19 - towards the rail y
08:23 - value and we are scrolling from the
08:26 - previous camera y this should smoothly
08:29 - bring our camera to our rail y value
08:32 - shall we take a look jumping through the
08:34 - portal oh nice did you see the level
08:38 - scroll up a touch and now we can no
08:41 - longer bring the screen up any higher we
08:43 - are indeed locked at the current portal
08:46 - height another test is to bring the
08:48 - portal up a little higher and try
08:52 - again this time we should see the level
08:54 - Scrolls up even higher with a rail of 55
08:58 - good job
09:00 - so as well as fixing the camera to this
09:02 - rail we also need to move the floor down
09:05 - so that it is only just visible on the
09:08 - stage okay then click into the floor
09:11 - Sprite and make it visible on the stage
09:15 - we can manually drag the floor costume
09:17 - down until it's at the height we are
09:20 - after even lower than this
09:23 - lower yeah so I guess for me a value of
09:27 - around -1 100 in the Y will be perfect
09:32 - it could be a little different for you
09:33 - depending on the height of your floor
09:35 - costume we'll make a new variable to
09:38 - hold this value name it floor shimmy and
09:43 - leave it for all
09:44 - Sprites right away set floor shimmy to
09:47 - not negative 100 but positive 100 or
09:53 - again whatever value you found looked
09:55 - best here then to actually move the
09:57 - floor down find the when I start as
10:00 - clone forever Loop we just want to
10:02 - adjust the set y depending whether we
10:04 - are on Rails or not so we need an if
10:08 - else everything else goes under that
10:11 - except the set Y block that goes inside
10:15 - the then branch and duplicate it into
10:18 - the else Branch
10:20 - too now fill out the if condition are we
10:23 - on a rail that's rail Y is greater than
10:27 - the empty value
10:29 - if we are then we position the floor at
10:32 - the current rail y but shimming it down
10:36 - by subtracting floor
10:39 - shimmy and finally drop that into the
10:41 - top set Y
10:43 - block oh yeah let's test I'm expecting
10:47 - the floor to drop away now as I enter
10:49 - the portal but oh it did but we have two
10:53 - floors visible I left the main floor
10:55 - Sprite visible on the stage that's why
10:57 - turn that off and try
11:00 - again and there we go so cool that's
11:04 - exactly where we want it on the screen
11:06 - but obviously something else is a miss
11:08 - here since we can now fly under the
11:11 - original
11:12 - level what we'll need to do is place a
11:15 - lower limit on how low this camera rail
11:18 - can be defined click back with me into
11:21 - our player Sprite and find the check
11:24 - portal custom block here we are setting
11:27 - the rail y draw in a simple if block
11:31 - beneath we want to check for when the
11:34 - rail y value is less
11:39 - than our floor
11:42 - shimmy if it is then it's just too low
11:45 - down and we set rail y back to floor
11:50 - shimmy if all is well when we jump
11:53 - through our portal the screen jumps up
11:55 - and is left with the whole level floor
11:58 - locked to the bottom of the screen that
12:00 - is perfect I'm really pleased with how
12:03 - that is looking now we just need to
12:05 - replicate this floor Sprite as a ceiling
12:08 - Sprite too to close the player
12:10 - in well then we'll duplicate the floor
12:16 - Sprite and name it
12:19 - ceiling we want to flip this costume
12:22 - perfectly upside down now you might
12:24 - think that tapping the flip vertical
12:26 - would do the job but sadly it's not
12:29 - relative to the canvas but the local
12:32 - costume I do have a fix for that though
12:35 - start by drawing a rectangle over the
12:37 - entire stage and then make sure it's
12:40 - snapped to the center of the canvas
12:43 - that's dead important then oh hold on
12:46 - let me make this shape an outline so
12:48 - that you can see this in action but you
12:50 - don't need to do this step now deselect
12:53 - everything by clicking in some free
12:55 - space and then flip vertic
12:59 - taada a perfect flip all you need to do
13:03 - now is then select and delete the large
13:05 - rectangle how cool is
13:08 - that next up a little bit of coding make
13:12 - sure we are still editing the ceiling
13:14 - Sprite we don't want to be setting these
13:17 - Global variables in the ceiling Sprite
13:19 - as well as the floor Sprite so remove
13:21 - them all including the one under the
13:24 - reset level hat
13:26 - block now we're not on a rail this
13:29 - ceiling wants to be hidden so we can
13:31 - just scroll it out of view set y to
13:36 - 999 we can test that that works by
13:38 - making the ceiling Sprite
13:40 - visible and then click that reset level
13:43 - script cool it vanishes well off the
13:47 - screen so coming down to the when I
13:50 - start as clone script when we are not on
13:53 - a rail that's the second set y here we
13:56 - want the ceiling to remain off screen
13:58 - green so once again set y
14:03 - 2999 but when it is on a rail rather
14:06 - than moving the Sprite down by floor
14:08 - shimmy we want to move it up by the same
14:10 - amount to move it to the top edge of the
14:13 - stage so that's rail y plus floor
14:18 - shimmy and pop that back in the set Y
14:20 - block like so you know what time it is
14:24 - it's testing
14:26 - time well that's interesting why have we
14:29 - got a ceiling visible on the title
14:31 - screen after all rail Y is not
14:35 - set oh I know I didn't hide the main
14:38 - floor Sprite
14:41 - don't okay here we
14:45 - go here we
14:47 - go and yes we have a ceiling and man it
14:51 - is nicely positioned the perfect mirror
14:54 - of the floor this is spoton and the
14:57 - player nicely bumps up against it when
14:59 - we fly to the top again and I love how
15:02 - the screen Scrolls up smoothly to reveal
15:04 - the new ceiling that is so
15:07 - cool so I'm really enjoying flying
15:10 - around the level but in all honesty we
15:12 - do need to introduce that second portal
15:14 - type to switch us back to a cube again
15:18 - what do you say we look into that next
15:21 - if you want to Simply recolor my
15:23 - existing portal then that's no problem
15:25 - but otherwise I have updated my geometry
15:28 - dash asset project to include the extra
15:30 - portal if you want it oh and while we
15:33 - are here you may also notice that there
15:35 - are some other new additions just in
15:37 - case I've started playing with some nice
15:39 - costumes for use as the background and
15:42 - the foreground scrolling areas but I
15:44 - don't expect us to use them this episode
15:46 - but I'll snag them anyhow into my
15:50 - backpack okay so back in our episode 8
15:52 - projects I'll remove the previous level
15:55 - asset Sprite and replace it with the new
15:58 - one from my
16:00 - backpack then we shall copy that new
16:02 - green portal so I'm going to place it On
16:05 - My Level Sprite perhaps on costume
16:10 - 3 yeah that is looking good we just need
16:15 - to trigger a change back to our Cube
16:18 - form back into the player Sprite and we
16:22 - want the check portal script which just
16:24 - happens to be the last one we looked at
16:26 - nice a new if
16:29 - to detect a new color we do need to make
16:32 - that portal visible on the stage though
16:34 - yep let's
16:36 - see there they are so in the player
16:39 - script carefully pick that green color
16:42 - from the
16:44 - stage and we don't need to do much to
16:46 - get back into the cube form a simple set
16:51 - mode to Cube for starters and then reset
16:55 - the rail y by setting it back to the
16:58 - empty
16:59 - value that will allow us to scroll
17:01 - vertically up and down once more and
17:04 - that is all amazing drag that down to
17:07 - the bottom of this script and pop it on
17:09 - the end as always as we run the project
17:13 - we need to ensure we hide that initial
17:15 - level costume are you ready for
17:18 - this ship the green portal and we are
17:23 - back to being a cube and we're dead but
17:26 - yeah this is excellent imagine what we
17:29 - can do with this we could almost finish
17:31 - making our stereo Madness level now and
17:36 - when I have a bit more time I most
17:37 - certainly will but right now I'm afraid
17:40 - that this is all we've got time for this
17:43 - episode I'm very much looking forward to
17:45 - adding in a proper scrolling background
17:47 - perhaps some wandering background
17:49 - particles and even better an actual
17:52 - ending to our level now that will be
17:55 - epic what are you most looking forward
17:57 - to
17:59 - so if you enjoyed watching this episode
18:01 - then please set that like button to a
18:03 - value of one and make sure you subscribe
18:06 - to the channel and enable that Bell icon
18:08 - so as not to miss my next exciting video
18:11 - the moment it drops until then though
18:15 - have a great week ahead and scratch on
18:27 - guys

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers we had a lot of fun adding the ship mode in last week's episode of our exciting Geometry Dash series and today we are going to finish the job in classic Geometry Dash when entering a portal the vertical scrolling level changes to become a sort of tunnel with a floor and ceiling and the position of this tunnel is centered around the portal that we last passed through so we are going to need some clever scrips to determine the vertical position of a portal on our level we'll need a new ceiling Sprite and we'll need to fix the vertical scrolling perfectly in place no problem we'll be doing this and More in today's episode so what are we waiting for load up your projects from episode 7 and we'll save them as a fresh new copy for this is episode 8 guys let's get scratching now before we dive into adding these fantastic new features let's quickly address two little bugs that you may have experienced from the last episode yeah a lot of you noticed that we started to get excessive particles when starting our first game whoops even when jumping through the air now but as soon as we die and we start the particles go back to normal this little buglet was introduced in the player Sprite under the green flag script this forever Loop to generate tit screen particles needs to be stopped when the game begins not just on death so a simple fix when I receive reset level we stop other scripts in Sprite and that's it give that a run and all is well again no more particles while we're jumping now the second issue wasn't as widely reported and you have to be quick to see it I'm going to place the ship portal at the start of the level once more to show you now watch what happens when we die did you see it look closer yeah we are turning back into the cube costume so how many of you noticed that one if you did then comment saw that bug under the video and better still comment bug squashed if you have already fixed it right I'll show you how I do it scroll down with me to the game on script and look at the forever Loop When We Touch pale yellow that's our spikes then we broadcast game over and we end this forever Loop but that's before we set the rotation style and costume back to mode so duplicate those two blocks and then bring them downwards to our game over scripts and here we are switching costumes not to mode but to cube this is the culprit we remove moove the old switch costume and we'll replace it with the rotation and switch costume block from above nice it's testing time smash that green flag and now bug squashed great job and so we can commence with the meat of this episode creating that horizontal ship mode tunnel now when we're designing our levels we can place our portals at any height however when the player enters it the level is scrolled vertically so that the portal is perfectly centered on the screen from now on our camera is locked to a horizontal rail our problem then is finding that y value of this rail what I suggest is that on touching the portal we switch to use a new hitbox costume that we can slide down the screen until it no longer touches that port portal color now we know where the portal ends the bottom of the portal we can easily calculate its Center too and we'll store that result in a new variable rail y well then let's make that new variable right away rail Y and it's for all Sprites now we should make sure to reset it in the green flag script setting rail y to the empty value however I'll duplicate it as we're going to need two of these one when the project starts and the other right down here in the game on script so it resets each time the level Starts Now to detecting the center of the portal we'll need that new hitbox costume duplicate the first hitbox and we'll name the new one hitbox portal to ensure it stays in contact with the rounded portal right to the very bottom we need it to be relatively wide so hold down the ALT key and stretch it sideways to a width of 72 then move it downwards while holding shift to keep it centered until its top is level with the center of the costume canvas just there good now we can script this up find the Define check portal script now just for a moment I'm going to separate off the existing three blocks from within here as they want to happen last and we switch to the new hitbox portal costume to do our detection sweep we are repeating until we are no longer that is not touching the portal color but until then we move down change y by negative 2 pixels okay we should now be clear of the portal let's record the position with a set rail Y 2 and we'll need a couple of addition blocks the middle of the portal is located at the current y position of the hitbox plus 50 that's half the portal height and finally add to that the current camera y value that we are already scrolled to perfect we found the center of the portal so return those previous scripts to the end of this if but hold on having moved the hit box down to the bottom of the portal our player will now be out of position we need to restore them back up to where they were before luckily that's exactly why we added the player y input here so set the player's y position back to the player y input nice and also we need to switch the costume back to the hitbox spike costume too so does this work let's find out hit that green flag and head for the portal 27 huh well that does sound about right since the portal is close to the middle of the screen already and subsequent attempts all come in with values roughly around the same Mark so that's good our next job is to scroll our level to the value in our rail y variable so can you find the defined camera tracking script we only want to change this when we are on a camera rail so if else inserted after setting the last camera Y and what we're going to check is if rail Y is greater than if rail Y is greater than the empty value then all these original cameras tracking scripts can be placed in the else Branch that's what we do when we're not on the rail but if we are on a camera rail then it's very simple duplicate one of those change camera y blocks and remove the Y position so we want to scroll the camera towards the rail y value and we are scrolling from the previous camera y this should smoothly bring our camera to our rail y value shall we take a look jumping through the portal oh nice did you see the level scroll up a touch and now we can no longer bring the screen up any higher we are indeed locked at the current portal height another test is to bring the portal up a little higher and try again this time we should see the level Scrolls up even higher with a rail of 55 good job so as well as fixing the camera to this rail we also need to move the floor down so that it is only just visible on the stage okay then click into the floor Sprite and make it visible on the stage we can manually drag the floor costume down until it's at the height we are after even lower than this lower yeah so I guess for me a value of around 1 100 in the Y will be perfect it could be a little different for you depending on the height of your floor costume we'll make a new variable to hold this value name it floor shimmy and leave it for all Sprites right away set floor shimmy to not negative 100 but positive 100 or again whatever value you found looked best here then to actually move the floor down find the when I start as clone forever Loop we just want to adjust the set y depending whether we are on Rails or not so we need an if else everything else goes under that except the set Y block that goes inside the then branch and duplicate it into the else Branch too now fill out the if condition are we on a rail that's rail Y is greater than the empty value if we are then we position the floor at the current rail y but shimming it down by subtracting floor shimmy and finally drop that into the top set Y block oh yeah let's test I'm expecting the floor to drop away now as I enter the portal but oh it did but we have two floors visible I left the main floor Sprite visible on the stage that's why turn that off and try again and there we go so cool that's exactly where we want it on the screen but obviously something else is a miss here since we can now fly under the original level what we'll need to do is place a lower limit on how low this camera rail can be defined click back with me into our player Sprite and find the check portal custom block here we are setting the rail y draw in a simple if block beneath we want to check for when the rail y value is less than our floor shimmy if it is then it's just too low down and we set rail y back to floor shimmy if all is well when we jump through our portal the screen jumps up and is left with the whole level floor locked to the bottom of the screen that is perfect I'm really pleased with how that is looking now we just need to replicate this floor Sprite as a ceiling Sprite too to close the player in well then we'll duplicate the floor Sprite and name it ceiling we want to flip this costume perfectly upside down now you might think that tapping the flip vertical would do the job but sadly it's not relative to the canvas but the local costume I do have a fix for that though start by drawing a rectangle over the entire stage and then make sure it's snapped to the center of the canvas that's dead important then oh hold on let me make this shape an outline so that you can see this in action but you don't need to do this step now deselect everything by clicking in some free space and then flip vertic taada a perfect flip all you need to do now is then select and delete the large rectangle how cool is that next up a little bit of coding make sure we are still editing the ceiling Sprite we don't want to be setting these Global variables in the ceiling Sprite as well as the floor Sprite so remove them all including the one under the reset level hat block now we're not on a rail this ceiling wants to be hidden so we can just scroll it out of view set y to 999 we can test that that works by making the ceiling Sprite visible and then click that reset level script cool it vanishes well off the screen so coming down to the when I start as clone script when we are not on a rail that's the second set y here we want the ceiling to remain off screen green so once again set y 2999 but when it is on a rail rather than moving the Sprite down by floor shimmy we want to move it up by the same amount to move it to the top edge of the stage so that's rail y plus floor shimmy and pop that back in the set Y block like so you know what time it is it's testing time well that's interesting why have we got a ceiling visible on the title screen after all rail Y is not set oh I know I didn't hide the main floor Sprite don't okay here we go here we go and yes we have a ceiling and man it is nicely positioned the perfect mirror of the floor this is spoton and the player nicely bumps up against it when we fly to the top again and I love how the screen Scrolls up smoothly to reveal the new ceiling that is so cool so I'm really enjoying flying around the level but in all honesty we do need to introduce that second portal type to switch us back to a cube again what do you say we look into that next if you want to Simply recolor my existing portal then that's no problem but otherwise I have updated my geometry dash asset project to include the extra portal if you want it oh and while we are here you may also notice that there are some other new additions just in case I've started playing with some nice costumes for use as the background and the foreground scrolling areas but I don't expect us to use them this episode but I'll snag them anyhow into my backpack okay so back in our episode 8 projects I'll remove the previous level asset Sprite and replace it with the new one from my backpack then we shall copy that new green portal so I'm going to place it On My Level Sprite perhaps on costume 3 yeah that is looking good we just need to trigger a change back to our Cube form back into the player Sprite and we want the check portal script which just happens to be the last one we looked at nice a new if to detect a new color we do need to make that portal visible on the stage though yep let's see there they are so in the player script carefully pick that green color from the stage and we don't need to do much to get back into the cube form a simple set mode to Cube for starters and then reset the rail y by setting it back to the empty value that will allow us to scroll vertically up and down once more and that is all amazing drag that down to the bottom of this script and pop it on the end as always as we run the project we need to ensure we hide that initial level costume are you ready for this ship the green portal and we are back to being a cube and we're dead but yeah this is excellent imagine what we can do with this we could almost finish making our stereo Madness level now and when I have a bit more time I most certainly will but right now I'm afraid that this is all we've got time for this episode I'm very much looking forward to adding in a proper scrolling background perhaps some wandering background particles and even better an actual ending to our level now that will be epic what are you most looking forward to so if you enjoyed watching this episode then please set that like button to a value of one and make sure you subscribe to the channel and enable that Bell icon so as not to miss my
