00:02 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch
00:05 - and can you believe it this is my 100th
00:08 - official youtube video wow it's amazing
00:11 - what's more it's been almost four months
00:13 - since i last posted an update on our
00:15 - tile scrolling akka mario tutorial that
00:17 - just won't do so for the many of you who
00:20 - are desperately thirsting for another
00:22 - episode prepare to be quenched can i
00:25 - just take a moment to plug my channel's
00:27 - inner circle membership because with
00:29 - that level you actually get full access
00:31 - to the finished projects it is also an
00:33 - awesome way to catch up before starting
00:35 - the next episode what we are going to be
00:36 - adding today are mario's star power
00:39 - power-ups yeah this is a really fun one
00:42 - because for a limited time mario
00:43 - transforms into a colorful killing
00:46 - machine no goomba koopa or piranha can
00:48 - stand in our path
00:50 - and as well as this most excellent
00:52 - edition we'll also be adding a whole
00:54 - raft of other niggling bugs wait what no
00:58 - we'll also be addressing a whole raft of
01:00 - other niggling bugs and missing features
01:02 - that we never really got around to
01:03 - sorting until now
01:06 - but before we begin if you remix the
01:09 - starter asset project before this
01:11 - episode came out then you'll need to
01:13 - find the asset project now it's linked
01:15 - under this video
01:16 - and in the sound sprite take a look at
01:19 - the sounds tab
01:20 - if you scroll down to the bottom you'll
01:22 - find two new sounds
01:24 - star power
01:27 - oh yeah we need that
01:29 - so make sure your backpack is open and
01:31 - drag that sound in
01:33 - and the other new sound is the course
01:35 - clear jingle and we need that too drag
01:38 - it into your backpack
01:40 - okay guys here we go open up your tile
01:43 - scrolling project from episode 19 and
01:46 - we'll begin as we always do by saving
01:48 - this as a new copy for this is episode
01:51 - 20. wow
01:53 - are you ready okay then let's get
01:56 - scratching
01:58 - so first let's add a missing feature
02:01 - it's been often pointed out to me that
02:03 - these mushroom power-ups should not be
02:05 - standing still no after they sprout they
02:08 - have a life of their own and should
02:10 - shoot off across the level well we have
02:13 - enemy movement scripts already in place
02:15 - so this shouldn't be hard click into the
02:17 - enemy sprite and find the define tick
02:21 - goomba script
02:22 - so these scripts here from the change
02:24 - speed y to the move sprite x are all
02:27 - handling enemy movements this is all
02:30 - very generic movement across all walking
02:32 - enemy types so let's wrap it up in a
02:34 - custom block to make it easy to use
02:36 - again
02:38 - make a new block named general move
02:41 - with an input accelerate x i'm going to
02:44 - abbreviate that to ack x for short
02:47 - a label maxx followed by another input
02:51 - max
02:52 - now run without screen refresh and we
02:54 - are done
02:55 - so the movement scripts can be stuffed
02:58 - on the end of this new define block and
03:00 - we'll make use of the new block from
03:02 - where we took these scripts a moment ago
03:08 - okay so let's match up the block input
03:10 - values
03:12 - the acceleration is given by the change
03:14 - speed x by 0.1 there so plug that value
03:18 - 0.1 into the general move block here
03:21 - next drag the input x accelerate x over
03:25 - the 0.1 in the define script
03:29 - great now this less than one is the
03:31 - maximum speed of the enemy plug that
03:34 - value into the max x of the move block
03:37 - and again pop the max input variable
03:40 - over the less than one
03:43 - okay that's almost done but we need to
03:45 - account for the other half of the script
03:47 - where the same numbers are negative
03:50 - just get two subtract blocks ready and
03:53 - drop the akkx input and the max input
03:56 - under the right hand sides of each
03:58 - and then carefully to plug in the right
04:00 - ones the negative x in the change block
04:04 - and the negative max in the speed x
04:07 - greater than check
04:09 - yay
04:09 - if we didn't make any mistakes then that
04:12 - should now work just the same as before
04:14 - [Music]
04:17 - no problems there
04:19 - excellent so now we can try to make use
04:22 - of this movement code in our mushroom
04:24 - life powerup code too
04:26 - find the define tick life script
04:29 - this is responsible for all the
04:30 - collectible power-ups the top part is to
04:33 - do with animating the sprouting of the
04:35 - power-up so scroll down until you find
04:37 - the if touching mario here it is
04:40 - so just before we do this check put in
04:43 - our new general move block the touching
04:45 - check can go right back in below it
04:48 - this little mushroom wants to move
04:50 - really quickly so set an acceleration of
04:53 - 3
04:54 - and a max x of one i want them just to
04:57 - zoom off right away
04:59 - here we go
05:00 - hit the block and it sprouts
05:03 - and off it goes brilliant yes that's how
05:06 - it should work
05:06 - [Music]
05:09 - okay oh but there's a problem yes
05:12 - only the mushrooms are supposed to be
05:14 - pushing off not these other power-ups
05:16 - right
05:17 - no problem we just need to surround the
05:20 - general move block with an if check
05:24 - and we'll check the costume root
05:26 - variable and make sure it's only equal
05:29 - to life
05:30 - that should do it don't you think
05:33 - firepower
05:34 - stays put great and the mushroom
05:39 - off it goes fantastic
05:40 - [Music]
05:42 - okay though hold on now we have movement
05:45 - i can see another mistake did you know
05:47 - that the mushroom power up should always
05:50 - rush off in the opposite direction to
05:52 - mario
05:53 - mine is rushing off in the same
05:54 - direction that mario is pointing
05:57 - find the define move enemy script
06:00 - and scroll down
06:04 - down until you see the if bump index is
06:07 - equal to spawn index this is where we
06:10 - bump a mystery block and here is where
06:12 - we set our enemy's direction
06:14 - we just want to flip this round so set
06:16 - it to zero subtract the direction of
06:19 - mario instead
06:21 - so if we face left before we bump this
06:23 - block
06:26 - off goes the mushroom to the right so
06:28 - cool
06:30 - and now for something more exciting
06:32 - let's add the new star power power up
06:35 - click into the tile sprite and look at
06:38 - the costumes you'll find the star
06:40 - costume is at costume of 46.
06:44 - there it is
06:45 - now we don't need to change the tile
06:47 - keymap list as we already added a 9 in
06:50 - there earlier for item 46
06:52 - but we do need to copy the costume into
06:54 - the enemy sprite like so
06:58 - click into the enemy sprite
07:01 - right to spawn the star power up find
07:04 - the define spawn type block
07:08 - now a tile type of 30 was our life power
07:12 - up we'll duplicate that if check just
07:14 - below
07:18 - only switch it to look for costume 46
07:22 - that's our star costume
07:24 - and then this costume name
07:26 - life switch that for star great
07:31 - plug it all back together and run the
07:33 - project
07:35 - we are going to need to enter the level
07:37 - editor and cycle through the enemy types
07:39 - with the nine key
07:41 - here's the star i'll drop it in the free
07:43 - gap between these other two power-ups
07:46 - and gosh while i'm at it i'll remove
07:48 - these other tiles as they are always
07:50 - getting in my way goodbye cooper
07:53 - testing a game
07:58 - and there it is yeah that's exciting to
08:00 - see now we just need to think what
08:03 - should happen when we collect it
08:06 - we'll need to find the tick life script
08:08 - again
08:10 - scroll down
08:12 - and here is where we handle the
08:13 - collection of each power-up if touching
08:16 - mario check the type of the power-up and
08:18 - we do something
08:20 - the first if is for the fire mario so in
08:24 - the l-side we'll add another if else
08:26 - check
08:27 - and compare the root costume with star
08:32 - okay then so this broadcast wants to be
08:35 - in the else as this is for when it's a
08:37 - mushroom type powerup
08:39 - but if it is a star then we will still
08:41 - broadcast a new message and name it
08:44 - collect star powerup
08:48 - nice
08:50 - okay so how about we trigger something
08:52 - off this perhaps the star power music
08:55 - for this we need to click into the sound
08:57 - sprite
08:58 - and the main game music loop is going
09:00 - off in here but we will want to stop
09:02 - that and start up a new loop when the
09:05 - power is collected but first click into
09:07 - the sounds tab open your backpack and
09:10 - drag in the two backpack sounds did you
09:13 - think i'd forgotten
09:14 - right back into the code tab
09:19 - when i receive collect star power
09:25 - start by stopping the other scripts in
09:27 - this sprite this will cut the music
09:29 - short nice
09:30 - now before we begin the new music track
09:33 - let's do something to let the game know
09:35 - star power is enabled
09:37 - make a new variable naming it star power
09:41 - and keep it for all sprites
09:44 - then we set star power to hmm
09:47 - a thousand but it doesn't really matter
09:49 - at present any number larger than zero
09:52 - will do
09:53 - and then we'll play sound
09:55 - until
09:56 - done that's important and choose the
09:58 - star power theme
10:00 - oh yeah this is gonna be cool
10:03 - now when the track finishes i want a
10:05 - little warning jingle to let us know
10:07 - that the time is coming to an end
10:09 - i don't think i have the right one but
10:11 - if we play the level select sound until
10:15 - done again
10:17 - i think that sounds pretty fit for
10:19 - purpose so pop that in right afterwards
10:22 - now once the music stops we can end the
10:25 - star power by setting star power back to
10:27 - the empty value and finish off by
10:30 - starting the main music again using our
10:33 - music block
10:35 - great are you ready for this
10:40 - [Music]
10:43 - now that
10:44 - is time to start dashing around the
10:46 - level dealing out some sweet goomba
10:48 - payback
10:49 - but let's just hear it end and watch
10:51 - that our star power variable reporter
10:53 - gets reset and there we go
10:57 - so next up we need to get mario's
11:00 - flashing rainbow colors to show he's in
11:02 - his special mode
11:04 - we'll need to click into the mario
11:06 - sprite
11:07 - and find the define reset player script
11:11 - we should make sure to reset the new
11:13 - star power variable to zero when the
11:15 - game begins don't forget that
11:22 - and then find the define paint sprite
11:25 - script
11:26 - this is where we change mario's costume
11:28 - now we want to trigger color changes too
11:32 - bring in an if-else block and we'll
11:34 - begin by looking for when star power is
11:36 - greater than zero
11:42 - and the best way to cycle rainbow colors
11:44 - is with a change color effect by
11:48 - and a value of 10 seems to work well for
11:51 - me
11:52 - in the else this is when the star power
11:54 - is over so use a set color effect to
11:58 - block
11:59 - and set it to zero
12:02 - that's pretty straightforward shall we
12:04 - just give that a test
12:09 - oh yes psychedelic nice right
12:13 - but at present this is really just shiny
12:16 - wrapping paper what about the actual
12:18 - present making mario invulnerable oh
12:21 - yeah
12:22 - no problemo click into the enemy sprite
12:25 - once more and we'll search out the
12:27 - defined tick goomba script
12:30 - look for where we are checking for
12:31 - touching mario
12:33 - now when we have star power all enemies
12:35 - just flip out of our path like they do
12:38 - when they get hit by a fireball
12:40 - in which case if star power is greater
12:43 - than zero
12:48 - we simply use the flip block
12:53 - then make sure to stop this script as
12:55 - this is the last thing we do this frame
12:58 - before we drop this in i'm going to make
13:00 - a copy of the script as we'll need to
13:02 - gain in a moment
13:04 - then drop it right in at the top under
13:07 - the touching mario check
13:10 - so that covers goomba and koopas but we
13:13 - also need to handle the piranha plant so
13:16 - find the defined tick piranha
13:18 - and again right after the touching mario
13:21 - check paste in the same star power check
13:23 - flip and stop this script blocks
13:26 - there we go
13:28 - so when you add new enemies we need to
13:30 - ensure we add the code to handle star
13:32 - power too most enemies will be beaten by
13:35 - this but enough talk we should give this
13:37 - a test right
13:38 - i'll pop up the power ups
13:40 - and then we can see how the star power
13:43 - feels now
13:45 - take this goomba yes it works perfectly
13:47 - the pavana oh yes no problem i wonder
13:51 - how long this will last scooting around
13:52 - the level now to take out as many
13:54 - goombas as i can oh no no i ran out just
13:58 - as i touched this last goomba and that
14:00 - cost me my super mario status too but no
14:03 - worries this is a super mechanic and
14:06 - it's working so well i just know you're
14:09 - gonna love getting this into your games
14:12 - right
14:13 - in the last part of this video let's fix
14:15 - up a few more little niggles that exist
14:17 - in the game
14:19 - firstly the end of level lack of music
14:23 - there's supposed to be a little end of
14:24 - level jingle here and we never got
14:26 - around to adding it
14:28 - that's of course in the sound sprite we
14:31 - already have an event we can trigger off
14:33 - to
14:34 - when i receive
14:35 - mario level complete
14:38 - so again we stop other scripts in this
14:41 - sprite
14:43 - before playing sound until done
14:46 - and choose the course clear jingle
14:50 - that's all we needed don't believe me
14:52 - give it a test
14:57 - [Music]
15:00 - oh man so much better
15:03 - now next up i have an interesting one
15:05 - for you did you know that when mario
15:07 - stands right next to a piranha infested
15:10 - pipe
15:11 - the piranha is not supposed to come out
15:13 - any longer
15:15 - the same is true for when you stand on
15:16 - top of it
15:17 - okay then so we'll need some kind of
15:20 - proximity check
15:22 - click into the enemy sprite and look for
15:24 - the define tick piranha script this is
15:27 - where we look for the piranha popping up
15:29 - yes as they reach stage four of their
15:32 - temp variable
15:33 - so what we'll do is insert a new if
15:36 - check for when the floor of temp is less
15:39 - than
15:40 - four
15:44 - that is they haven't yet popped up
15:47 - now we should check how close mario is
15:49 - to the pipe
15:51 - if less than
15:53 - and we'll want to be closer than say 45
15:56 - pixels that's a bit more than a tile so
15:59 - we can be up against the pipe and it
16:01 - will trigger
16:02 - to calculate the horizontal distance
16:04 - we'll use an abs that's the absolute
16:06 - with a subtract and we want the distance
16:09 - between this piranha's x variable
16:11 - and not the x position but the x
16:14 - variable
16:19 - of the player sprite
16:22 - so if the distance is less than 45 then
16:25 - we set frame
16:28 - back to one
16:29 - this holds the piranha in the pipe until
16:31 - we are no longer too close by
16:34 - let's test that again so firstly you'll
16:37 - notice the enemy can be out of the pipe
16:39 - when we get close
16:40 - aha you'll note a distinct lack of
16:43 - parana if i move a little away i hope
16:46 - yes there they are super last check is
16:49 - to jump on top and just wait a moment
16:53 - looking great
16:55 - so what else remains unfixed i hear you
16:58 - ask
16:59 - how about this little gem you must have
17:02 - seen this one if i obtain the fireball
17:04 - power-up did you know that you can blast
17:06 - away the other power-ups
17:08 - yes look this one is just too funny and
17:11 - that's not the best of them you can also
17:13 - blast away the end-of-level box yeah
17:16 - that really is messed up oh so funny
17:19 - look hilarious yes but we should really
17:22 - fix this one too
17:24 - this isn't quite so simple though well
17:26 - it is and it isn't find the when i
17:29 - receive player after enemy this is where
17:32 - all enemies get flipped by killer
17:35 - enemies
17:36 - like cooper shells or fireballs
17:38 - but you'll note enemies that are already
17:41 - flipped are excluded from being flipped
17:44 - well we can extend this list of
17:46 - unaffected types the fastest way is to
17:48 - use a contains block with the type on
17:51 - the right
17:53 - and then on the left write flip as
17:56 - before but to add more just add a space
17:59 - and then life
18:01 - and also a space and end box that's
18:05 - inbox as one word
18:07 - so long term this may not be the best
18:09 - way to do it as the list of types will
18:11 - get longer and longer but i don't think
18:13 - it'll be a problem right now
18:15 - let's see how that holds up
18:17 - grab the fire flower and try blasting
18:19 - the level end
18:21 - oh man it's fixed what a shame right
18:25 - next up shooting another power
18:28 - nope these are invulnerable too
18:31 - but this does show up the single flaw to
18:33 - this approach and that is that these
18:35 - power-ups are blocking the passageway of
18:37 - the fireballs this is a bit of a shame
18:39 - as it would be nice if they just passed
18:41 - on through but the way we have things
18:43 - set up that's getting a little too
18:45 - tricky to sort out without a lot more
18:47 - work so i think we'll just have to be
18:49 - happy with what we've got here it's not
18:51 - so bad right
18:54 - hey hold on a second did you see that
18:57 - that mushroom powerup just went and slid
18:59 - behind a jump through platform oh gosh
19:02 - that is only happening since we allowed
19:05 - them to move
19:06 - fix one thing break another right i
19:09 - think this should have an easy fix
19:10 - though if we find the define tick life
19:13 - script in the enemy sprite
19:16 - so here when the frame is less than 48
19:19 - the power-up is sprouting upwards at
19:21 - which point it is behind the other
19:23 - sprites so that it appears from behind
19:25 - them
19:26 - so last thing as it sprouts we need to
19:28 - bring it to the front
19:30 - um if frame equals 47
19:34 - that's one before 48 pop in a go-to
19:38 - front block
19:40 - and this can go in here last thing when
19:43 - frame is still less than 48
19:46 - i think that will sort this out
19:48 - hold on
19:50 - here we go
19:53 - there perfect the mushroom is nicely in
19:56 - front of the background blocks now phew
20:00 - well here we are the end of another
20:02 - episode the next step for this tutorial
20:04 - would be to add more enemy types but
20:07 - more important working warp pipes i
20:11 - would so love to have these but the
20:13 - problem we face is that this tutorial
20:14 - series didn't start out intending to be
20:16 - a mario clone so the level grid system
20:19 - we used was not designed to easily fit
20:22 - this purpose hmm
20:24 - what are we going to do about that then
20:27 - anyhow that's all i have for you today i
20:30 - hope you enjoyed this video if you want
20:32 - more mario then you must smash the like
20:34 - button and comment under the video to
20:36 - give it your support do subscribe to
20:38 - this channel so as not to miss the next
20:40 - exciting video i expect it will be
20:42 - either the next episode of our raycaster
20:44 - or something completely different who
20:46 - knows i don't yet
20:48 - well that's it thanks for watching have
20:51 - a great week ahead and scratch on guys
20:59 - [Music]
21:02 - you

hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch and can you believe it this is my 100th official youtube video wow it's amazing what's more it's been almost four months since i last posted an update on our tile scrolling akka mario tutorial that just won't do so for the many of you who are desperately thirsting for another episode prepare to be quenched can i just take a moment to plug my channel's inner circle membership because with that level you actually get full access to the finished projects it is also an awesome way to catch up before starting the next episode what we are going to be adding today are mario's star power powerups yeah this is a really fun one because for a limited time mario transforms into a colorful killing machine no goomba koopa or piranha can stand in our path and as well as this most excellent edition we'll also be adding a whole raft of other niggling bugs wait what no we'll also be addressing a whole raft of other niggling bugs and missing features that we never really got around to sorting until now but before we begin if you remix the starter asset project before this episode came out then you'll need to find the asset project now it's linked under this video and in the sound sprite take a look at the sounds tab if you scroll down to the bottom you'll find two new sounds star power oh yeah we need that so make sure your backpack is open and drag that sound in and the other new sound is the course clear jingle and we need that too drag it into your backpack okay guys here we go open up your tile scrolling project from episode 19 and we'll begin as we always do by saving this as a new copy for this is episode 20. wow are you ready okay then let's get scratching so first let's add a missing feature it's been often pointed out to me that these mushroom powerups should not be standing still no after they sprout they have a life of their own and should shoot off across the level well we have enemy movement scripts already in place so this shouldn't be hard click into the enemy sprite and find the define tick goomba script so these scripts here from the change speed y to the move sprite x are all handling enemy movements this is all very generic movement across all walking enemy types so let's wrap it up in a custom block to make it easy to use again make a new block named general move with an input accelerate x i'm going to abbreviate that to ack x for short a label maxx followed by another input max now run without screen refresh and we are done so the movement scripts can be stuffed on the end of this new define block and we'll make use of the new block from where we took these scripts a moment ago okay so let's match up the block input values the acceleration is given by the change speed x by 0.1 there so plug that value 0.1 into the general move block here next drag the input x accelerate x over the 0.1 in the define script great now this less than one is the maximum speed of the enemy plug that value into the max x of the move block and again pop the max input variable over the less than one okay that's almost done but we need to account for the other half of the script where the same numbers are negative just get two subtract blocks ready and drop the akkx input and the max input under the right hand sides of each and then carefully to plug in the right ones the negative x in the change block and the negative max in the speed x greater than check yay if we didn't make any mistakes then that should now work just the same as before no problems there excellent so now we can try to make use of this movement code in our mushroom life powerup code too find the define tick life script this is responsible for all the collectible powerups the top part is to do with animating the sprouting of the powerup so scroll down until you find the if touching mario here it is so just before we do this check put in our new general move block the touching check can go right back in below it this little mushroom wants to move really quickly so set an acceleration of 3 and a max x of one i want them just to zoom off right away here we go hit the block and it sprouts and off it goes brilliant yes that's how it should work okay oh but there's a problem yes only the mushrooms are supposed to be pushing off not these other powerups right no problem we just need to surround the general move block with an if check and we'll check the costume root variable and make sure it's only equal to life that should do it don't you think firepower stays put great and the mushroom off it goes fantastic okay though hold on now we have movement i can see another mistake did you know that the mushroom power up should always rush off in the opposite direction to mario mine is rushing off in the same direction that mario is pointing find the define move enemy script and scroll down down until you see the if bump index is equal to spawn index this is where we bump a mystery block and here is where we set our enemy's direction we just want to flip this round so set it to zero subtract the direction of mario instead so if we face left before we bump this block off goes the mushroom to the right so cool and now for something more exciting let's add the new star power power up click into the tile sprite and look at the costumes you'll find the star costume is at costume of 46. there it is now we don't need to change the tile keymap list as we already added a 9 in there earlier for item 46 but we do need to copy the costume into the enemy sprite like so click into the enemy sprite right to spawn the star power up find the define spawn type block now a tile type of 30 was our life power up we'll duplicate that if check just below only switch it to look for costume 46 that's our star costume and then this costume name life switch that for star great plug it all back together and run the project we are going to need to enter the level editor and cycle through the enemy types with the nine key here's the star i'll drop it in the free gap between these other two powerups and gosh while i'm at it i'll remove these other tiles as they are always getting in my way goodbye cooper testing a game and there it is yeah that's exciting to see now we just need to think what should happen when we collect it we'll need to find the tick life script again scroll down and here is where we handle the collection of each powerup if touching mario check the type of the powerup and we do something the first if is for the fire mario so in the lside we'll add another if else check and compare the root costume with star okay then so this broadcast wants to be in the else as this is for when it's a mushroom type powerup but if it is a star then we will still broadcast a new message and name it collect star powerup nice okay so how about we trigger something off this perhaps the star power music for this we need to click into the sound sprite and the main game music loop is going off in here but we will want to stop that and start up a new loop when the power is collected but first click into the sounds tab open your backpack and drag in the two backpack sounds did you think i'd forgotten right back into the code tab when i receive collect star power start by stopping the other scripts in this sprite this will cut the music short nice now before we begin the new music track let's do something to let the game know star power is enabled make a new variable naming it star power and keep it for all sprites then we set star power to hmm a thousand but it doesn't really matter at present any number larger than zero will do and then we'll play sound until done that's important and choose the star power theme oh yeah this is gonna be cool now when the track finishes i want a little warning jingle to let us know that the time is coming to an end i don't think i have the right one but if we play the level select sound until done again i think that sounds pretty fit for purpose so pop that in right afterwards now once the music stops we can end the star power by setting star power back to the empty value and finish off by starting the main music again using our music block great are you ready for this now that is time to start dashing around the level dealing out some sweet goomba payback but let's just hear it end and watch that our star power variable reporter gets reset and there we go so next up we need to get mario's flashing rainbow colors to show he's in his special mode we'll need to click into the mario sprite and find the define reset player script we should make sure to reset the new star power variable to zero when the game begins don't forget that and then find the define paint sprite script this is where we change mario's costume now we want to trigger color changes too bring in an ifelse block and we'll begin by looking for when star power is greater than zero and the best way to cycle rainbow colors is with a change color effect by and a value of 10 seems to work well for me in the else this is when the star power is over so use a set color effect to block and set it to zero that's pretty straightforward shall we just give that a test oh yes psychedelic nice right but at present this is really just shiny wrapping paper what about the actual present making mario invulnerable oh yeah no problemo click into the enemy sprite once more and we'll search out the defined tick goomba script look for where we are checking for touching mario now when we have star power all enemies just flip out of our path like they do when they get hit by a fireball in which case if star power is greater than zero we simply use the flip block then make sure to stop this script as this is the last thing we do this frame before we drop this in i'm going to make a copy of the script as we'll need to gain in a moment then drop it right in at the top under the touching mario check so that covers goomba and koopas but we also need to handle the piranha plant so find the defined tick piranha and again right after the touching mario check paste in the same star power check flip and stop this script blocks there we go so when you add new enemies we need to ensure we add the code to handle star power too most enemies will be beaten by this but enough talk we should give this a test right i'll pop up the power ups and then we can see how the star power feels now take this goomba yes it works perfectly the pavana oh yes no problem i wonder how long this will last scooting around the level now to take out as many goombas as i can oh no no i ran out just as i touched this last goomba and that cost me my super mario status too but no worries this is a super mechanic and it's working so well i just know you're gonna love getting this into your games right in the last part of this video let's fix up a few more little niggles that exist in the game firstly the end of level lack of music there's supposed to be a little end of level jingle here and we never got around to adding it that's of course in the sound sprite we already have an event we can trigger off to when i receive mario level complete so again we stop other scripts in this sprite before playing sound until done and choose the course clear jingle that's all we needed don't believe me give it a test oh man so much better now next up i have an interesting one for you did you know that when mario stands right next to a piranha infested pipe the piranha is not supposed to come out any longer the same is true for when you stand on top of it okay then so we'll need some kind of proximity check click into the enemy sprite and look for the define tick piranha script this is where we look for the piranha popping up yes as they reach stage four of their temp variable so what we'll do is insert a new if check for when the floor of temp is less than four that is they haven't yet popped up now we should check how close mario is to the pipe if less than and we'll want to be closer than say 45 pixels that's a bit more than a tile so we can be up against the pipe and it will trigger to calculate the horizontal distance we'll use an abs that's the absolute with a subtract and we want the distance between this piranha's x variable and not the x position but the x variable of the player sprite so if the distance is less than 45 then we set frame back to one this holds the piranha in the pipe until we are no longer too close by let's test that again so firstly you'll notice the enemy can be out of the pipe when we get close aha you'll note a distinct lack of parana if i move a little away i hope yes there they are super last check is to jump on top and just wait a moment looking great so what else remains unfixed i hear you ask how about this little gem you must have seen this one if i obtain the fireball powerup did you know that you can blast away the other powerups yes look this one is just too funny and that's not the best of them you can also blast away the endoflevel box yeah that really is messed up oh so funny look hilarious yes but we should really fix this one too this isn't quite so simple though well it is and it isn't find the when i receive player after enemy this is where all enemies get flipped by killer enemies like cooper shells or fireballs but you'll note enemies that are already flipped are excluded from being flipped well we can extend this list of unaffected types the fastest way is to use a contains block with the type on the right and then on the left write flip as before but to add more just add a space and then life and also a space and end box that's inbox as one word so long term this may not be the best way to do it as the list of types will get longer and longer but i don't think it'll be a problem right now let's see how that holds up grab the fire flower and try blasting the level end oh man it's fixed what a shame right next up shooting another power nope these are invulnerable too but this does show up the single flaw to this approach and that is that these powerups are blocking the passageway of the fireballs this is a bit of a shame as it would be nice if they just passed on through but the way we have things set up that's getting a little too tricky to sort out without a lot more work so i think we'll just have to be happy with what we've got here it's not so bad right hey hold on a second did you see that that mushroom powerup just went and slid behind a jump through platform oh gosh that is only happening since we allowed them to move fix one thing break another right i think this should have an easy fix though if we find the define tick life script in the enemy sprite so here when the frame is less than 48 the powerup is sprouting upwards at which point it is behind the other sprites so that it appears from behind them so last thing as it sprouts we need to bring it to the front um if frame equals 47 that's one before 48 pop in a goto front block and this can go in here last thing when frame is still less than 48 i think that will sort this out hold on here we go there perfect the mushroom is nicely in front of the background blocks now phew well here we are the end of another episode the next step for this tutorial would be to add more enemy types but more important working warp pipes i would so love to have these but the problem we face is that this tutorial series didn't start out intending to be a mario clone so the level grid system we used was not designed to easily fit this purpose hmm what are we going to do about that then anyhow that's all i have for you today i hope you enjoyed this video if you want more mario then you must smash the like button and comment under the video to give it your support do subscribe to this channel so as not to miss the next exciting video i expect it will be either the next episode of our raycaster or something completely different who knows i don't yet well that's it thanks for watching have a great week ahead and scratch on guys you
