00:00 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff batch
00:03 - and today we're going to get excited
00:04 - about the project that i'm working on
00:06 - right now um it's been three months in
00:08 - the making and
00:09 - still going strong but um you might have
00:12 - seen on my profile
00:14 - did someone say apple um some of you
00:16 - know who apple is some don't
00:18 - apple was invented by a guy called
00:21 - legobauer9
00:23 - apple is a bit of a legend in many
00:25 - circles and
00:26 - you may have noticed that he featured in
00:28 - my getting over it game
00:30 - at the very top of the level and some
00:32 - people thought that was a sign that
00:34 - maybe i was going to use him in another
00:35 - game
00:36 - and well they were right so let's have a
00:39 - look
00:39 - where we're at so switching to
00:42 - my project in the making you'll see we
00:45 - have this guy apple
00:48 - okay let's jump straight in
00:51 - so this is apple and he's on a tile
00:53 - based
00:54 - system here so i can rush along it's
00:57 - very very
00:58 - very straight level so the aim of this
01:02 - is to make it all really nice and smooth
01:04 - and a lot of fun to play the
01:08 - platforming scripts are very similar to
01:10 - the ones i've released on youtube
01:12 - um except for these are
01:15 - working on a tile-based system now i
01:17 - haven't done a tutorial on that yet but
01:19 - i surely will at some point
01:21 - but it's like the minecraft strategy so
01:23 - we have
01:24 - a grid of tiles and the benefit of this
01:27 - is that you can have the
01:29 - editor kind of in-game so i can actually
01:31 - go ahead and start building levels
01:34 - on the fly in the game and then have a
01:35 - play on it and see what it's like
01:37 - and it also means of course then other
01:39 - scratchers can join in the fun too of
01:40 - designing levels
01:42 - so this is apple he can jump and do
01:45 - little jumps
01:47 - he also has the ability to use his hat
01:50 - as a wall slide so his hat is a bit
01:53 - sticky
01:54 - um which is quite interesting because it
01:57 - also means
01:58 - if i was to overhang like this and jump
02:01 - up
02:02 - i can stick to the ceiling but just be
02:04 - careful because i can't actually walk on
02:06 - the ceiling so his hat is sticky
02:08 - but only temporarily he can slide a
02:11 - little bit but he can't walk
02:13 - okay so his jump height is not enough to
02:16 - get me up here
02:18 - i can also crouch which is really cute
02:23 - but we have this problem that tile sizes
02:29 - are really quite tall so what is the
02:30 - point of being on a crouch if tiles are
02:32 - this big
02:34 - well because our tiles are not all full
02:37 - squares
02:38 - i toggle to a second tile look at this i
02:40 - have half height
02:42 - tiles and i can rotate it
02:45 - and i can pop it in there like this and
02:48 - now
02:49 - crouching suddenly becomes useful so
02:52 - that's great
02:53 - what else have we got
02:57 - so let's have a look different types of
03:00 - tiles
03:01 - crunched tiles
03:04 - and this one i love this one let's put
03:06 - two of them here
03:08 - okay now for this to work i need to
03:09 - restart the game
03:11 - aha look at that it's like the level is
03:15 - watching you
03:17 - i really like that and this is a high
03:19 - feature of the game
03:20 - is that the level itself is kind of
03:22 - against you
03:24 - okay so let's just delete this
03:29 - what other things can you have in the
03:30 - game so we've got like obstacles to jump
03:33 - over
03:34 - what about some pits to jump over so we
03:36 - could have
03:37 - a spike pit let me just delete
03:40 - these blocks here switch
03:43 - to spikes again i can rotate these
03:46 - different angles
03:48 - pop them in like that okay
03:51 - now those eyeballs are still there
03:53 - because they are spawned separately let
03:55 - me run the game again and it'll
03:56 - disappear
03:57 - there we go and here's our spikes which
04:00 - i can jump over
04:01 - and i've gone for the geometry dash
04:03 - style ending like that
04:05 - there'll be lots of particle effects and
04:08 - a nice big
04:09 - bang and shake screen i like that
04:13 - right what else have we got
04:17 - let's have a look through the sprites
04:18 - shall we say we've got blocks
04:20 - eyeballs half size blocks
04:24 - little blocks corner blocks crack blocks
04:26 - uh let's look at this one
04:28 - so this is a special block because it
04:30 - goes with an enemy let's put it in here
04:32 - like this
04:34 - let's look for our enemies right so we
04:35 - have this the first type of enemy i'll
04:37 - just show you those two
04:39 - before we do any more um yeah okay i'll
04:42 - show you these
04:44 - here they are and these guys
04:47 - walk around turn around and they
04:50 - run towards me and i see them i can jump
04:52 - on their heads
04:55 - and now the next type of enemy i'll show
04:57 - you
04:58 - is this guy this is a masher
05:02 - so i'll just put a block above it and
05:03 - you'll see how it works first
05:07 - let me start
05:10 - okay so this thing crunches down
05:14 - there's a few particle effects which is
05:15 - nice and cool i'll try and squash you
05:18 - and it stops on that block above
05:22 - but you can see how it's working because
05:24 - you can see it going through so it's
05:25 - important when this is designed
05:27 - that you cover it up with these like
05:30 - that
05:31 - generally it would be like part of the
05:34 - ceiling
05:35 - so it looked like this
05:42 - and it's also a platform so it takes you
05:46 - up
05:47 - that wouldn't be a very good thing to do
05:48 - if you wouldn't want to die that is
05:51 - of course i could take out one side
05:56 - and then the theory i can stick to it
06:02 - oh yeah i want to do that to you
06:05 - so to go along with these other baddies
06:07 - i've got
06:09 - lifts and platforms so this is a lift
06:12 - it'll go up and down let's try adding
06:15 - one in here
06:16 - and i shall stop it from moving now
06:19 - we've got a special block where is it
06:22 - gonna find it oh that was it that cross
06:25 - now this is invisible to the player but
06:28 - it helps to stop things from moving so
06:30 - if i put it
06:31 - there level with the top of the building
06:33 - there
06:34 - and then run this game now
06:38 - this little lift will go up to the top
06:41 - of the building
06:41 - and then come down again like that
06:50 - now i can also stick to it of course i'm
06:52 - not walking so i can still stick when
06:53 - it's going up and down
06:56 - oh i'd like me um
07:00 - and so we have those sort of blocks we
07:03 - also have
07:07 - trampolines so we have a look at all
07:08 - those in action i'll just pop it down
07:10 - there
07:12 - there we go
07:21 - um yeah so as you can see there's an
07:24 - awful lot of stuff
07:25 - all coming together in this game let me
07:28 - uh
07:28 - what should we do what else have we got
07:31 - should we have a look at some other
07:32 - enemies
07:33 - the blade saw so if i point this at the
07:36 - ground
07:37 - uh let's do it over here i'll do it on
07:40 - this wall here so if i point it towards
07:41 - the wall
07:42 - like that and then i have to put in some
07:45 - of those special
07:47 - these ones here to stop it from going
07:48 - past the edges
07:50 - like that run that
07:56 - there you go so now we have a blade saw
08:00 - that went up and down the edge
08:02 - so this level edge is all designed so
08:04 - that you can quickly
08:06 - create enemies and trains
08:09 - it all hangs together nice and stably
08:12 - so that you can enjoy the game um
08:15 - it's anything we haven't covered i
08:17 - wonder there's a few other things oh let
08:19 - me show you one of the big
08:21 - one of the big bosses so well
08:24 - this one actually isn't a boss this is
08:25 - just
08:27 - ah there he is i just like him because
08:30 - he's so big
08:32 - so this is more just of a part of the
08:37 - part of what the characters that you'll
08:39 - meet he rolls
08:41 - towards you
08:44 - he mustn't be squashed but because he's
08:46 - so nice and big you can walk on him and
08:48 - use him as a platform
08:50 - so he's both an obstacle and a can be a
08:54 - help you might need to use him to get to
08:57 - places
09:00 - okay and just to finish off here is the
09:02 - level i've been
09:03 - constructing as i test my game to test
09:06 - that all the different
09:07 - mechanics are working together it's nice
09:10 - just to
09:11 - make sure that things are working as
09:13 - intended
09:14 - um and so this was testing all the
09:16 - different aspects of the game that i had
09:19 - i'll just do a quick run-through checks
09:22 - that i can bounce on the heads i can
09:24 - make gaps i can fit down holes
09:27 - all the different enemy types working
09:32 - wall jumping check squishing
09:36 - checkpoints
09:40 - so this game is all coming together
09:42 - quite nicely um as you expect there's
09:44 - still a little bit of work to be done
09:46 - but i'm really excited to be sharing
09:47 - this with you as soon as i can
09:49 - if you've enjoyed this little update
09:51 - then please like the video
09:52 - and subscribe let me know in the
09:55 - comments what you think of the game so
09:56 - far and whether you can see anything
09:58 - that i could improve
09:59 - or anything you like let me know it'd be
10:01 - really good
10:02 - i hope to catch you again soon on
10:04 - scratch and scratch on
10:27 - you
