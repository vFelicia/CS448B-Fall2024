00:00 - hi I'm Griff patch and welcome to this
00:02 - new series on creating cloud multiplayer
00:04 - games in scratch I really love cloud
00:06 - games for me there's nothing quite like
00:08 - actually seeing other players playing in
00:10 - your own scratch game in the background
00:12 - here you can see one of my most
00:14 - successful cloud projects in action this
00:16 - is of course my slither I o port
00:18 - featuring up to 8 players with drop in
00:20 - and out gameplay behind the scenes we
00:23 - have a game host negotiation or two
00:25 - disconnection timeouts for word
00:26 - prediction of player positions to reduce
00:28 - latency and far more but fear not we are
00:32 - going to start simple and build things
00:34 - up over the course of the next few
00:36 - videos before we begin can I just bring
00:39 - your attention to the fact that to
00:40 - create and play cloud games and scratch
00:42 - you need to have full scratcher status
00:45 - you can check this out on your profile
00:47 - here if you're still a new scratcher
00:50 - then I'm really sorry but you'll have to
00:52 - do a little more scratching before you
00:54 - can join in with this tutorial right
00:56 - let's go cloud variable basics let's
01:00 - start by creating our first cloud
01:01 - variable simply click the make available
01:03 - button as normal give it a name I've
01:06 - chosen p1 X this stands for player 1x
01:09 - and tick the cloud variable box before
01:11 - pressing ok we get a warning about cloud
01:14 - variables popping up just dismiss that
01:16 - it's just letting us know that cloud
01:18 - verbals can only store numbers not
01:20 - letters and words we'll talk about that
01:22 - in the next video and there it is our
01:25 - new cloud available but what does it do
01:27 - well simply put if we changed the value
01:30 - of this variable in our project then any
01:33 - other scratch are playing your project
01:34 - will see the variable change in their
01:35 - game too the value is stored in the
01:38 - cloud the internet for every one share
01:40 - to be able to show you this in action I
01:42 - need to be editing a shared project I'll
01:46 - split my screen in half the left side I
01:48 - shall log in as Grif patch tutor and the
01:50 - right
01:51 - I shall log in on my main Grif match
01:52 - account I just need to make sure my left
01:56 - side project is saved and that the right
01:58 - one is reloaded to bring in the latest
01:59 - changes now when I change the value of
02:02 - the cloud variable on the left by
02:03 - clicking the change variable block to
02:05 - run it you can see that the right-hand
02:07 - project also changes value this is cloud
02:10 - variables in action
02:12 - right let's make this a little more fun
02:14 - add another cloud variable P 1y and tick
02:18 - the cloud verbal box and create one last
02:21 - variable this time not a cloud variable
02:23 - naming it player so when the green flag
02:26 - is clicked let's set the player variable
02:29 - to 0 at the beginning of the game we
02:31 - don't want to be player 1 yet to allow
02:34 - the player to set themselves as player 1
02:35 - we add a when key pressed hat block
02:38 - choosing the number one key and set the
02:41 - player to 1 now back to the green flag
02:43 - block stack we add a forever loop this
02:46 - is our game loop and within that an if
02:48 - statement that runs when player is equal
02:50 - to 1 the idea is that when we have
02:53 - become player 1 we want to record our
02:55 - mouse position for the other players to
02:57 - see on their screens so set the two
03:00 - cloud variables P 1 X and y 2 mouse x
03:03 - and mouse Y finally under the if block
03:07 - but still within the forever loop add a
03:09 - go to X Y that positions our sprite at P
03:13 - 1 X and P 1 Y the position of player
03:15 - ones Mouse so let's give this a try I'll
03:19 - switch back to having my to web browsers
03:21 - open side by side and here we go click
03:23 - the green flag on both sides now without
03:26 - pressing the one key nothing happens as
03:28 - both players are still player zero not
03:31 - playing but on the left hand side now I
03:34 - press the 1 key and you can see that the
03:36 - player variable has changed to a 1 and
03:38 - the cap is now following my mouse what's
03:40 - more on the right side we are able to
03:43 - see player ones cap moving to almost
03:45 - mimicking the left hand cat this is
03:48 - really exciting to see in action but I
03:50 - have to say it can be a little bit of a
03:51 - letdown at first because as you can see
03:53 - the movement of the right hand sprite is
03:56 - anything but smooth so why is this let
04:01 - me slow this down for you well although
04:03 - we are changing the value of both the X
04:04 - and y cloud variables very fast the
04:07 - cloud servers that transmit these values
04:09 - to other projects only allow one
04:11 - available change every tenth of a second
04:13 - in our case either the X or the Y one
04:17 - but not both at once so the position of
04:20 - the sprite moves in steps sideways
04:23 - either up or down or left and right
04:26 - diagonally because it's only changing
04:28 - either the X or the Y and these changes
04:31 - come through in drips like one after the
04:33 - other
04:33 - so what can be done well the first thing
04:36 - to do is address the fact that we are
04:37 - trying to send to cloud veil was at once
04:39 - so in the next video we shall
04:42 - investigate a technique to reduce this
04:44 - to a single cloud update using variable
04:47 - encoding and decoding but for this video
04:49 - that's it so please subscribe love the
04:52 - video watch out for part two in a series
04:53 - it's going to be fun I'm Griff patch
04:56 - thank you for watching bye guys
05:05 - you

hi I'm Griff patch and welcome to this new series on creating cloud multiplayer games in scratch I really love cloud games for me there's nothing quite like actually seeing other players playing in your own scratch game in the background here you can see one of my most successful cloud projects in action this is of course my slither I o port featuring up to 8 players with drop in and out gameplay behind the scenes we have a game host negotiation or two disconnection timeouts for word prediction of player positions to reduce latency and far more but fear not we are going to start simple and build things up over the course of the next few videos before we begin can I just bring your attention to the fact that to create and play cloud games and scratch you need to have full scratcher status you can check this out on your profile here if you're still a new scratcher then I'm really sorry but you'll have to do a little more scratching before you can join in with this tutorial right let's go cloud variable basics let's start by creating our first cloud variable simply click the make available button as normal give it a name I've chosen p1 X this stands for player 1x and tick the cloud variable box before pressing ok we get a warning about cloud variables popping up just dismiss that it's just letting us know that cloud verbals can only store numbers not letters and words we'll talk about that in the next video and there it is our new cloud available but what does it do well simply put if we changed the value of this variable in our project then any other scratch are playing your project will see the variable change in their game too the value is stored in the cloud the internet for every one share to be able to show you this in action I need to be editing a shared project I'll split my screen in half the left side I shall log in as Grif patch tutor and the right I shall log in on my main Grif match account I just need to make sure my left side project is saved and that the right one is reloaded to bring in the latest changes now when I change the value of the cloud variable on the left by clicking the change variable block to run it you can see that the righthand project also changes value this is cloud variables in action right let's make this a little more fun add another cloud variable P 1y and tick the cloud verbal box and create one last variable this time not a cloud variable naming it player so when the green flag is clicked let's set the player variable to 0 at the beginning of the game we don't want to be player 1 yet to allow the player to set themselves as player 1 we add a when key pressed hat block choosing the number one key and set the player to 1 now back to the green flag block stack we add a forever loop this is our game loop and within that an if statement that runs when player is equal to 1 the idea is that when we have become player 1 we want to record our mouse position for the other players to see on their screens so set the two cloud variables P 1 X and y 2 mouse x and mouse Y finally under the if block but still within the forever loop add a go to X Y that positions our sprite at P 1 X and P 1 Y the position of player ones Mouse so let's give this a try I'll switch back to having my to web browsers open side by side and here we go click the green flag on both sides now without pressing the one key nothing happens as both players are still player zero not playing but on the left hand side now I press the 1 key and you can see that the player variable has changed to a 1 and the cap is now following my mouse what's more on the right side we are able to see player ones cap moving to almost mimicking the left hand cat this is really exciting to see in action but I have to say it can be a little bit of a letdown at first because as you can see the movement of the right hand sprite is anything but smooth so why is this let me slow this down for you well although we are changing the value of both the X and y cloud variables very fast the cloud servers that transmit these values to other projects only allow one available change every tenth of a second in our case either the X or the Y one but not both at once so the position of the sprite moves in steps sideways either up or down or left and right diagonally because it's only changing either the X or the Y and these changes come through in drips like one after the other so what can be done well the first thing to do is address the fact that we are trying to send to cloud veil was at once so in the next video we shall investigate a technique to reduce this to a single cloud update using variable encoding and decoding but for this video that's it so please subscribe love the video watch out for part two in a series it's going to be fun I'm Griff patch thank you for watching bye guys you
