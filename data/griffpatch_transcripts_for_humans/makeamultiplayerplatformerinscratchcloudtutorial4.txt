00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - hello fellow purple scratchers you've
00:05 - all seen and played these awesome online
00:07 - scratch games and who hasn't wanted to
00:09 - make their own well today that dream
00:11 - comes true as we take our powerful Cloud
00:13 - Player Sprite developed over the last
00:15 - three episodes of this series and drop
00:17 - it into our own games you can choose any
00:21 - game you like but today I'm going to
00:23 - show you step by step how we can add it
00:25 - to our classic platformer games
00:26 - instantly transforming them into online
00:29 - Platformers supporting 100 players and
00:32 - up due to popular demand I've opened an
00:35 - official scratch studio for the series
00:36 - linked under the video and it's already
00:38 - filling up with your crazy awesome MMO
00:41 - projects very cool so when you have
00:44 - something fun to share do visit the
00:46 - studio and ask a curator to have the
00:48 - project added too I cannot wait to play
00:51 - them okay so Wow Let's just address the
00:54 - purple elephant in the room yes purple
00:57 - is the new blue and love it or hate it I
01:00 - think the color scheme is here to stay
01:03 - and so my friends we load up our
01:06 - completed episode 3 Cloud purples I mean
01:09 - projects we're going to get it backpack
01:12 - ready all are important and backpackable
01:15 - scripts are already in the cloud player
01:17 - Sprite and here they are and to make
01:20 - them work with our projects we just need
01:23 - a few scripts to be present in our main
01:25 - game Sprite to be specific that would be
01:28 - a broadcast to Cloud setup and then in a
01:31 - game Loop the add position X and Y to my
01:34 - values and a broadcast to Cloud tick
01:38 - that's not much right and to make it
01:40 - even easier to remember we can drag this
01:42 - small block of code into the Cloud
01:45 - Player Sprite too
01:47 - okay great so these scripts will now be
01:51 - included in our backpackable Sprite so
01:53 - open up your backpack now and drop the
01:56 - entire Cloud Player Sprite in there
01:59 - excellent time to dig out our old
02:02 - classic platformer projects I hope you
02:05 - can find them I love this platforming
02:07 - game engine because it has so many cool
02:09 - features and is really easy to extend
02:12 - and make any number of cool games with
02:13 - and now we'll make it Cloud play
02:16 - compatible the least that we want to
02:18 - achieve is to bring other players into
02:20 - the game they should move around animate
02:22 - just like our player and move from
02:24 - screen to screen so we'll begin as
02:27 - always we do by Saving oops watch out
02:30 - the file menu has moved position
02:32 - saving as a new copy because this is oh
02:36 - what this isn't going so well please try
02:38 - again okay saving as a new copy for this
02:42 - is the cloud enabled scratch platformer
02:45 - oh yeah
02:47 - Step One open our backpacks and drag in
02:50 - the cloud player Sprite I'm going to
02:53 - move mine up to the top of the Sprite
02:55 - list for convenience as I like it next
02:57 - to the main player Sprite
03:00 - okay so notice along with our Cloud
03:02 - Player Sprite scratch is also helpfully
03:05 - brought in the cloud variables and other
03:07 - required lists or at least that's what
03:10 - we are led to believe sadly though these
03:13 - Cloud variables look the part but they
03:15 - are imposters they're fake and they
03:18 - don't work at all and you can tell
03:21 - they're fake because even after
03:22 - reloading the project doesn't show as
03:24 - being cloud enabled on the project page
03:27 - so to fix this we must remove and re-add
03:31 - each of these Cloud variables but hold
03:34 - on there we have to be careful because
03:36 - well watch this if I delete Cloud 1 from
03:40 - my project scratch also deletes the
03:42 - variables from my scripts this is
03:44 - terrible and this will cause all sorts
03:47 - of problems so let me undo that with
03:49 - Ctrl Z
03:51 - and now the way to safely do this is to
03:53 - click into the stage Sprite and now
03:57 - delete all of the cloud variables one
04:00 - through eight
04:02 - and without going back into the other
04:04 - Sprite create a new variable oh my this
04:07 - purple and blue is a little clashy and
04:10 - we add Cloud one back into our project
04:12 - remember to mark it as a cloud variable
04:15 - brilliant and of course do the same for
04:18 - Cloud 2 3 4 5 6 7 and Cloud eight all
04:24 - Cloud variables and as long as you
04:26 - delete and create them from the stage
04:28 - none of the other Sprite variables get
04:30 - messed up and everything will work as
04:32 - expected great hide all them variable
04:36 - reporters and find those orphaned game
04:39 - Loop scripts we prepared a moment ago
04:41 - those are the ones we want to copy into
04:44 - the main player Sprite now so drag them
04:47 - over
04:48 - and the fun begins click into the player
04:51 - Sprite and let's see where these new
04:53 - scripts should go well the initial
04:56 - broadcaster set up the cloud scripts
04:58 - should only run once so we'll drop that
05:01 - under the when green flag clicked but
05:03 - before we launched the main menu
05:06 - this leaves us with the scripts that
05:07 - record the player's position and
05:09 - broadcast to run the cloud Scripts
05:11 - these will need to go into the main game
05:13 - Loop so bring them down here's the main
05:16 - game Loop as you can see we already have
05:20 - a forever Loop here we can transfer our
05:22 - scripts over to the existing one we just
05:25 - want to ensure we broadcast Cloud tick
05:27 - after moving the player but before that
05:29 - tick Last Broadcast
05:31 - Splendid that's the initial integration
05:33 - complete and so it's already testing
05:37 - time make sure the project is saved and
05:40 - from the project page size the window to
05:42 - the left side of the screen
05:44 - then we're going to duplicate the tab
05:46 - and pop it over to the right this makes
05:48 - testing easy okay running the left
05:51 - project
05:52 - good and the right project
05:55 - cool wow oh my have my scratch cat just
05:59 - swelled in size yeah so there was a
06:03 - large cat sat in front of me but my
06:05 - actual player is still displaying as
06:06 - usual but look over to the other project
06:09 - and you'll notice the large second
06:10 - player is moving around following my
06:12 - actions this is actually really cool
06:14 - that's all we coded the multiplayer
06:16 - Sprite to be able to do if we want extra
06:19 - functionality like player animations and
06:22 - direction of movement which obviously we
06:24 - do then we have a little bit of extra
06:26 - work to do but don't worry it's
06:28 - surprisingly easy at present we only
06:31 - send a player's X and Y position through
06:33 - the cloud we just need to add to this
06:35 - the player's costume and their Direction
06:37 - too
06:38 - add to my values the costume number
06:43 - and again the Sprites Direction
06:47 - simple
06:49 - drop that in after adding the X and Y
06:51 - position
06:52 - indeed these two properties of a Sprite
06:54 - are so commonly needed in a multiplayer
06:56 - game we might consider adding them to
06:58 - the backpackable Sprite itself for the
07:00 - next time in fact I'll just copy these
07:02 - blocks now and clicking into the cloud
07:04 - player's bright I'll paste them in
07:06 - adding them to the orphaned mini script
07:08 - here just like we do in the Real Player
07:10 - Sprite now
07:11 - next scroll over to the Define player
07:15 - clone tick script
07:16 - and then down at the bottom this is
07:19 - where the Cloud Player receives the
07:21 - messages that we just sent
07:23 - at present we're just expecting an X and
07:26 - Y position but of course we will now be
07:28 - receiving a costume number and a
07:31 - Direction
07:32 - so duplicate the bottom four blocks and
07:34 - we'll start by reading in a new value
07:37 - and so we switch costume two that vowel
07:40 - variable we just decoded then we read in
07:43 - the next value this should be the
07:45 - direction so point in direction again
07:48 - using the decoded vowel variable awesome
07:52 - just tidy that up drop those scripts
07:55 - after the others and we've read in all
07:57 - four values and updated the Sprite
07:59 - accordingly so I think you can give that
08:02 - another test
08:03 - now don't forget save and then reload
08:05 - the right hand window to get the latest
08:07 - scripts and then smash those green flags
08:11 - so did we miss something this looks
08:15 - exactly the same well no not exactly the
08:18 - second player is now animating
08:20 - kind of and they do change direction
08:23 - only they flip upside down well both
08:27 - completely explainable firstly flipping
08:30 - upside down That's a classic case of not
08:32 - having set the direction mode to Left
08:34 - Right living and as for the costume
08:37 - animation looking wrong well the player
08:40 - Sprite has all these costumes but the
08:43 - Cloud Player Sprite just has these two
08:46 - and that is never gonna work we need
08:49 - them to share the exact same set of
08:51 - costumes
08:52 - so we'll start by removing all the
08:55 - costumes from the Cloud Player Sprite
08:57 - well we can't remove the first so
08:59 - instead name it delete me for later
09:03 - then we'll click back into the first
09:04 - Sprite and we'll begin dragging each
09:06 - costume one at a time into the cloud
09:08 - player's bright I find it easiest if I
09:11 - count them off as I go so as not to copy
09:13 - the same one twice or to miss one
09:15 - costumes three four five and then scroll
09:20 - down and continue with 6 7 8 you get the
09:24 - picture and yes we even copy those
09:26 - hitbox costumes not because they're used
09:29 - in the cloud Sprite but just because
09:31 - keeping the costume numbers the same is
09:33 - super important and that makes it easier
09:36 - oh hello guy you didn't want to be left
09:39 - out did you so the last costume was
09:41 - costume number 36 so when we now click
09:44 - into the Cloud Player Sprite we should
09:46 - find there are 37 costumes yes that's
09:49 - one more why because we still need to
09:52 - scroll up and delete the leftover delete
09:55 - me costume and feel free to just double
09:58 - check the costume numbers all match up
09:59 - and if they do then splendid we can give
10:03 - that another test to confirm the
10:04 - animations are now playing back
10:06 - correctly not forgetting to reload that
10:08 - right hand project then here we go
10:12 - and scratchtastic we have some gorgeous
10:15 - running animations now this just proves
10:17 - that the costumes were all copied
10:19 - correctly between our Sprites
10:21 - so I can see just two issues remaining
10:23 - now the turning upside down and our
10:25 - oversized cat Sprite no problem click
10:29 - into the Cloud Player Sprite and enter
10:31 - the direction dialog then switch the
10:34 - mode from all around to left right and
10:38 - then if we check the size of the
10:40 - original player Sprite it's set to 40.
10:43 - so back in our Cloud plus bright and set
10:46 - size to 40 to match and save again this
10:49 - is going to be good I've reloaded the
10:51 - right hand project and that is beautiful
10:54 - finally the player is moving animating
10:56 - and turning just like they are on the
10:59 - first screen this is so neat so are we
11:03 - done well almost
11:05 - look what happens when a player moves
11:07 - from one screen to the next oh dear all
11:11 - the players remain on the same screen
11:13 - with you it looks so weird seeing them
11:15 - floating around on non-existent
11:16 - platforms so to fix this we must only
11:19 - display Cloud Player clones when they
11:22 - are on the same scene number as the main
11:24 - player that's the scene hash available
11:26 - shown down here
11:28 - so that we'll need adding to the growing
11:30 - list available sent over the cloud
11:33 - back into the player Sprite then and
11:36 - that game Loop receiver will pop in one
11:39 - more add to list block
11:41 - adding in the current players scene hash
11:43 - variable as the fifth item added to the
11:46 - list
11:48 - and then back into the Cloud Player
11:50 - Sprite find the player clone tick script
11:53 - and scroll down to the bottom we need to
11:57 - read in that fifth value the cloud
11:59 - player's scene number
12:02 - and using an if else
12:05 - check if that value is equal to the main
12:08 - players scene hash variable
12:12 - great because if it is then this clone
12:15 - is on the same scene and we can show
12:17 - this Sprite otherwise let's just hide it
12:21 - sounds simple enough shall we give it a
12:24 - try so here we are on scene one and both
12:27 - players are visible so I'll wander onto
12:30 - scene two
12:31 - oh man this is not what I was hoping for
12:34 - the second player should be hidden now
12:36 - but instead we are toggling between
12:38 - hidden and visible erratically this is
12:41 - most certainly a bug in my script what
12:43 - did I miss
12:45 - so I'm showing and hiding down here but
12:47 - tell you what scroll up further and uh
12:51 - yes okay there's another show block up
12:53 - here this triggers when reading in a new
12:56 - cloud value and it's no longer required
12:58 - if we are controlling the visibility
13:00 - lower down so remove that carefully but
13:03 - make sure to leave in the hide block
13:04 - here for when the player times out after
13:07 - leaving the game
13:09 - right I'm feeling good about this so
13:12 - we'll give it another try
13:13 - walking to scene two
13:16 - brilliant and the second player is
13:18 - correctly hidden then coming back scene
13:21 - one and there they are just where we
13:23 - left them so this is really cool but you
13:27 - know what I've just noticed this scene
13:29 - switching is still not quite perfect you
13:32 - might note that cloud players still hang
13:33 - around on a previous scene as we change
13:35 - over and this bugs me something rotten
13:38 - and after a bit of faffing around I got
13:41 - to the bottom of it to tighten things up
13:43 - we need to Simply keep track of the
13:45 - scene each player clone was last seen on
13:47 - and when we change scene in sure we
13:50 - quickly update the visibility to match
13:52 - so scroll down and make a new variable
13:56 - naming it clone scene hash making sure
14:00 - to create it for this Sprite only so
14:02 - that each clone can have their own scene
14:04 - number recorded then after reading in
14:07 - the last vowel that's the scene number
14:09 - we set clone scene hash to Val
14:14 - then for clarity replace this vowel with
14:17 - the new clone scene hash bearable
14:20 - right if you had a dig into the player
14:24 - code you'd find that the Last Broadcast
14:26 - in our Loop is the tick last
14:30 - and this one checks for the player
14:32 - moving off the scene and if they do we
14:34 - broadcast about to change scene followed
14:37 - by the actual change scene event we'll
14:40 - use this to clean up the player clones
14:42 - as the scene changes so back in the
14:45 - cloud player Sprite
14:46 - when I receive change the scene
14:49 - and then to ensure we don't mess with
14:52 - the Clone Factory check if player hash
14:55 - is greater than the empty value
14:58 - and if it is then hurray just duplicate
15:00 - that if else script we made a moment ago
15:03 - to correct the visibility of any clones
15:04 - as the scene switches over and if all is
15:08 - well we should now have pretty perfect
15:10 - scene changing at last let's see
15:14 - switching scene now
15:16 - did it work I think so hold on checking
15:20 - it out in slow motion and by jove I
15:24 - think we've got it what a relief so as
15:27 - you can tell sometimes these scripts
15:29 - need a little tweaking to get the most
15:31 - out of them up until now I'd only use
15:34 - them on scrolling games so the scene
15:36 - changing was a little new to me but we
15:38 - got there in the end and so that's it we
15:41 - have cloud enabled the classic
15:43 - platformer what you do next is up to you
15:47 - as I mentioned earlier I've opened up a
15:49 - scratch studio for your finished
15:50 - projects and they don't need to be from
15:52 - the classic platformer I'd be even more
15:54 - excited to see what other projects you
15:56 - are able to Cloud enable using these
15:58 - scripts if there's any other Concepts
16:00 - you'd like covering like displaying
16:02 - players usernames above their heads or
16:04 - how to find projectiles that everyone
16:06 - can see then drop me a comment under the
16:08 - video letting me know what you find most
16:10 - helpful but that's all we've got time
16:13 - for today if you've enjoyed the video
16:15 - then please smash that like button and
16:17 - if you haven't already remember to

16:26 - until next time I hope you have a great
16:28 - week ahead and scratch on guys
16:33 - beautiful purple

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow purple scratchers you've all seen and played these awesome online scratch games and who hasn't wanted to make their own well today that dream comes true as we take our powerful Cloud Player Sprite developed over the last three episodes of this series and drop it into our own games you can choose any game you like but today I'm going to show you step by step how we can add it to our classic platformer games instantly transforming them into online Platformers supporting 100 players and up due to popular demand I've opened an official scratch studio for the series linked under the video and it's already filling up with your crazy awesome MMO projects very cool so when you have something fun to share do visit the studio and ask a curator to have the project added too I cannot wait to play them okay so Wow Let's just address the purple elephant in the room yes purple is the new blue and love it or hate it I think the color scheme is here to stay and so my friends we load up our completed episode 3 Cloud purples I mean projects we're going to get it backpack ready all are important and backpackable scripts are already in the cloud player Sprite and here they are and to make them work with our projects we just need a few scripts to be present in our main game Sprite to be specific that would be a broadcast to Cloud setup and then in a game Loop the add position X and Y to my values and a broadcast to Cloud tick that's not much right and to make it even easier to remember we can drag this small block of code into the Cloud Player Sprite too okay great so these scripts will now be included in our backpackable Sprite so open up your backpack now and drop the entire Cloud Player Sprite in there excellent time to dig out our old classic platformer projects I hope you can find them I love this platforming game engine because it has so many cool features and is really easy to extend and make any number of cool games with and now we'll make it Cloud play compatible the least that we want to achieve is to bring other players into the game they should move around animate just like our player and move from screen to screen so we'll begin as always we do by Saving oops watch out the file menu has moved position saving as a new copy because this is oh what this isn't going so well please try again okay saving as a new copy for this is the cloud enabled scratch platformer oh yeah Step One open our backpacks and drag in the cloud player Sprite I'm going to move mine up to the top of the Sprite list for convenience as I like it next to the main player Sprite okay so notice along with our Cloud Player Sprite scratch is also helpfully brought in the cloud variables and other required lists or at least that's what we are led to believe sadly though these Cloud variables look the part but they are imposters they're fake and they don't work at all and you can tell they're fake because even after reloading the project doesn't show as being cloud enabled on the project page so to fix this we must remove and readd each of these Cloud variables but hold on there we have to be careful because well watch this if I delete Cloud 1 from my project scratch also deletes the variables from my scripts this is terrible and this will cause all sorts of problems so let me undo that with Ctrl Z and now the way to safely do this is to click into the stage Sprite and now delete all of the cloud variables one through eight and without going back into the other Sprite create a new variable oh my this purple and blue is a little clashy and we add Cloud one back into our project remember to mark it as a cloud variable brilliant and of course do the same for Cloud 2 3 4 5 6 7 and Cloud eight all Cloud variables and as long as you delete and create them from the stage none of the other Sprite variables get messed up and everything will work as expected great hide all them variable reporters and find those orphaned game Loop scripts we prepared a moment ago those are the ones we want to copy into the main player Sprite now so drag them over and the fun begins click into the player Sprite and let's see where these new scripts should go well the initial broadcaster set up the cloud scripts should only run once so we'll drop that under the when green flag clicked but before we launched the main menu this leaves us with the scripts that record the player's position and broadcast to run the cloud Scripts these will need to go into the main game Loop so bring them down here's the main game Loop as you can see we already have a forever Loop here we can transfer our scripts over to the existing one we just want to ensure we broadcast Cloud tick after moving the player but before that tick Last Broadcast Splendid that's the initial integration complete and so it's already testing time make sure the project is saved and from the project page size the window to the left side of the screen then we're going to duplicate the tab and pop it over to the right this makes testing easy okay running the left project good and the right project cool wow oh my have my scratch cat just swelled in size yeah so there was a large cat sat in front of me but my actual player is still displaying as usual but look over to the other project and you'll notice the large second player is moving around following my actions this is actually really cool that's all we coded the multiplayer Sprite to be able to do if we want extra functionality like player animations and direction of movement which obviously we do then we have a little bit of extra work to do but don't worry it's surprisingly easy at present we only send a player's X and Y position through the cloud we just need to add to this the player's costume and their Direction too add to my values the costume number and again the Sprites Direction simple drop that in after adding the X and Y position indeed these two properties of a Sprite are so commonly needed in a multiplayer game we might consider adding them to the backpackable Sprite itself for the next time in fact I'll just copy these blocks now and clicking into the cloud player's bright I'll paste them in adding them to the orphaned mini script here just like we do in the Real Player Sprite now next scroll over to the Define player clone tick script and then down at the bottom this is where the Cloud Player receives the messages that we just sent at present we're just expecting an X and Y position but of course we will now be receiving a costume number and a Direction so duplicate the bottom four blocks and we'll start by reading in a new value and so we switch costume two that vowel variable we just decoded then we read in the next value this should be the direction so point in direction again using the decoded vowel variable awesome just tidy that up drop those scripts after the others and we've read in all four values and updated the Sprite accordingly so I think you can give that another test now don't forget save and then reload the right hand window to get the latest scripts and then smash those green flags so did we miss something this looks exactly the same well no not exactly the second player is now animating kind of and they do change direction only they flip upside down well both completely explainable firstly flipping upside down That's a classic case of not having set the direction mode to Left Right living and as for the costume animation looking wrong well the player Sprite has all these costumes but the Cloud Player Sprite just has these two and that is never gonna work we need them to share the exact same set of costumes so we'll start by removing all the costumes from the Cloud Player Sprite well we can't remove the first so instead name it delete me for later then we'll click back into the first Sprite and we'll begin dragging each costume one at a time into the cloud player's bright I find it easiest if I count them off as I go so as not to copy the same one twice or to miss one costumes three four five and then scroll down and continue with 6 7 8 you get the picture and yes we even copy those hitbox costumes not because they're used in the cloud Sprite but just because keeping the costume numbers the same is super important and that makes it easier oh hello guy you didn't want to be left out did you so the last costume was costume number 36 so when we now click into the Cloud Player Sprite we should find there are 37 costumes yes that's one more why because we still need to scroll up and delete the leftover delete me costume and feel free to just double check the costume numbers all match up and if they do then splendid we can give that another test to confirm the animations are now playing back correctly not forgetting to reload that right hand project then here we go and scratchtastic we have some gorgeous running animations now this just proves that the costumes were all copied correctly between our Sprites so I can see just two issues remaining now the turning upside down and our oversized cat Sprite no problem click into the Cloud Player Sprite and enter the direction dialog then switch the mode from all around to left right and then if we check the size of the original player Sprite it's set to 40. so back in our Cloud plus bright and set size to 40 to match and save again this is going to be good I've reloaded the right hand project and that is beautiful finally the player is moving animating and turning just like they are on the first screen this is so neat so are we done well almost look what happens when a player moves from one screen to the next oh dear all the players remain on the same screen with you it looks so weird seeing them floating around on nonexistent platforms so to fix this we must only display Cloud Player clones when they are on the same scene number as the main player that's the scene hash available shown down here so that we'll need adding to the growing list available sent over the cloud back into the player Sprite then and that game Loop receiver will pop in one more add to list block adding in the current players scene hash variable as the fifth item added to the list and then back into the Cloud Player Sprite find the player clone tick script and scroll down to the bottom we need to read in that fifth value the cloud player's scene number and using an if else check if that value is equal to the main players scene hash variable great because if it is then this clone is on the same scene and we can show this Sprite otherwise let's just hide it sounds simple enough shall we give it a try so here we are on scene one and both players are visible so I'll wander onto scene two oh man this is not what I was hoping for the second player should be hidden now but instead we are toggling between hidden and visible erratically this is most certainly a bug in my script what did I miss so I'm showing and hiding down here but tell you what scroll up further and uh yes okay there's another show block up here this triggers when reading in a new cloud value and it's no longer required if we are controlling the visibility lower down so remove that carefully but make sure to leave in the hide block here for when the player times out after leaving the game right I'm feeling good about this so we'll give it another try walking to scene two brilliant and the second player is correctly hidden then coming back scene one and there they are just where we left them so this is really cool but you know what I've just noticed this scene switching is still not quite perfect you might note that cloud players still hang around on a previous scene as we change over and this bugs me something rotten and after a bit of faffing around I got to the bottom of it to tighten things up we need to Simply keep track of the scene each player clone was last seen on and when we change scene in sure we quickly update the visibility to match so scroll down and make a new variable naming it clone scene hash making sure to create it for this Sprite only so that each clone can have their own scene number recorded then after reading in the last vowel that's the scene number we set clone scene hash to Val then for clarity replace this vowel with the new clone scene hash bearable right if you had a dig into the player code you'd find that the Last Broadcast in our Loop is the tick last and this one checks for the player moving off the scene and if they do we broadcast about to change scene followed by the actual change scene event we'll use this to clean up the player clones as the scene changes so back in the cloud player Sprite when I receive change the scene and then to ensure we don't mess with the Clone Factory check if player hash is greater than the empty value and if it is then hurray just duplicate that if else script we made a moment ago to correct the visibility of any clones as the scene switches over and if all is well we should now have pretty perfect scene changing at last let's see switching scene now did it work I think so hold on checking it out in slow motion and by jove I think we've got it what a relief so as you can tell sometimes these scripts need a little tweaking to get the most out of them up until now I'd only use them on scrolling games so the scene changing was a little new to me but we got there in the end and so that's it we have cloud enabled the classic platformer what you do next is up to you as I mentioned earlier I've opened up a scratch studio for your finished projects and they don't need to be from the classic platformer I'd be even more excited to see what other projects you are able to Cloud enable using these scripts if there's any other Concepts you'd like covering like displaying players usernames above their heads or how to find projectiles that everyone can see then drop me a comment under the video letting me
