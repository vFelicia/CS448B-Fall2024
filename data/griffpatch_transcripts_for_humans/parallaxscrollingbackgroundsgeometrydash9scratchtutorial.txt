00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers today I want to
00:05 - quickly dive back into our Geometry Dash
00:07 - series because oh no some of you may
00:11 - well have experienced this horrendous
00:14 - bug if that is you then I am so sorry
00:18 - and I'll explain why and how to fix it
00:21 - in just a moment but for the rest of you
00:24 - fear not we also have some new content
00:28 - do you see what it is oh man yes The
00:31 - Parallax scrolling background At Last I
00:35 - really really wanted to get this in
00:38 - before the next episode when we will
00:40 - introduce end portals and that is going
00:44 - to be just too cool so right off the bat
00:47 - the horrendous bug well everything may
00:51 - have seemed to be working fine but if I
00:54 - was to click on the level Sprite make it
00:57 - visible and then happen to drag it on
01:01 - the stage well that would bring the
01:03 - level Sprite in front of the player as
01:06 - it always does and this has an
01:09 - unforeseen consequence run the project
01:12 - oh sorry uh hide the level Sprite again
01:15 - first now things look okay at first but
01:19 - as soon as you start the game
01:22 - disaster no music no particles no
01:25 - collisions or jumping indeed no Gameplay
01:28 - at all if this has happened to you then
01:30 - I can imagine you would have pulled out
01:32 - your hair trying to solve it so let me
01:35 - help you now click back into the player
01:39 - Sprite now remember how we added this
01:41 - when I receive reset level receiver
01:44 - specifically to stop the particles when
01:46 - we started a new game well sadly if the
01:50 - level is ordered in front of the player
01:53 - Sprite then this reset level also stops
01:56 - the main game Loop to it's all all down
02:00 - to the execution order the simple fix is
02:03 - to ensure the main Sprite is in front so
02:07 - drop in a go to front block up here
02:09 - under the green flag script Let's test
02:12 - that
02:14 - theory yes music particles I can jump
02:18 - and just a sanity check I'll bring the
02:20 - level back in front and try that
02:23 - again yeah we got it bug squashed and
02:27 - that was a real Corker I'm just glad
02:30 - it's now
02:32 - fixed right then on we go how about we
02:35 - work on adding that scrolling
02:38 - background now you can draw this
02:40 - yourself but if you prefer to snag my
02:43 - pre-drawn background assets they're
02:44 - linked under the video then it's found
02:46 - under the purple sprite here just open
02:49 - your backpack and drop it
02:54 - in so back in our episode 9 projects we
02:58 - now have access to the purple sprite and
03:01 - this includes both a new floor and
03:03 - ceiling costume should you wish to use
03:05 - them then you can but also the new
03:08 - background costume this should be 720 by
03:12 - 360 pixels in size and it's actually
03:16 - made up of two identical 360 by 360
03:20 - halves side by side I just fused them
03:23 - together to ensure that there be no
03:25 - seams now having the two images as part
03:28 - of the same costume means that if we
03:30 - size this background up real big we can
03:34 - create our infinite scroller without the
03:37 - need to create any extra clones and that
03:40 - just makes things that little bit easier
03:42 - to
03:43 - manage so we'll Begin by making a new
03:46 - Sprite for this naming IT
03:49 - background and we either drag in the
03:52 - purple background costume or we spend
03:53 - the time to draw this ourselves just
03:56 - make sure it is 2 360x 360 TI
04:00 - side by side we keep the name of the
04:03 - costume as
04:04 - backround but also we need a second
04:08 - blank costume and that I'm going to name
04:12 - tiny let me show you why we need this if
04:15 - I reselect the background costume now we
04:18 - need this to be even larger than 100% so
04:21 - that half of the costume fills the
04:23 - entire stage but if we try to enlarge it
04:26 - to say 150% scratch is having none of it
04:29 - and it keeps it set to 100 nope it
04:32 - doesn't want your costume to become
04:34 - bigger than the stage bother well this
04:37 - isn't a problem for the tiny costume the
04:40 - costume is quite happy being set to 150%
04:43 - since it's already really small but the
04:46 - crazy thing is once the Sprite is at
04:48 - 150% if we switch back to our large
04:51 - background costume it doesn't get down
04:54 - size this time staying at the 150% that
04:56 - we wanted well how fortunate
05:00 - let's formalize that in
05:02 - code when green flag
05:05 - clicked
05:07 - show and then switch costume to
05:11 - Tiny before then setting the Sprite size
05:15 - to
05:17 - 150 and then we can switch the costume
05:20 - back to the background costume now we
05:24 - need to ensure that we move this
05:25 - background right to the back behind
05:28 - everything else go to back
05:31 - layer however there is one more Sprite
05:34 - the particle Sprite that is already
05:36 - trying to go to the back so to ensure
05:39 - that the background one wins We'll add a
05:42 - weight zero just before sending it back
05:46 - that way the particle goes first and
05:48 - then this one second if you hit the
05:50 - green flag we can confirm this is
05:52 - working and that the background looks
05:55 - fantastic especially with the new floor
05:57 - colors what we need to do next is get it
06:01 - scrolling along with the level no
06:05 - problem
06:07 - forever and we'll change X
06:10 - by but we'll need to
06:13 - divide so we divide scroll
06:17 - speed by 10 this is so that the
06:20 - background moves 10 times slower than
06:23 - the foreground this is called The
06:25 - Parallax effect and it gives it that 3D
06:28 - depth that we're looking for
06:30 - yeah that is really cool but the only
06:33 - problem is sooner or later we are going
06:35 - to hit the end of this costume so now we
06:40 - need to cycle it around into an infinite
06:44 - Loop if and a less
06:48 - than if the X position is less than H
06:53 - what value exactly well our cycle wants
06:56 - to loop from here to here
07:00 - that's the length of 1 half of the
07:03 - costume the costume is 720 pixels wide
07:07 - but we sized it to 150% so that now
07:10 - makes it
07:12 - 1,80 pixels
07:14 - across half of that is 540 pixels and
07:19 - half again is
07:20 - 270 pixels so whenever we move left
07:24 - below - 270 we add back 540 to continue
07:30 - the perfect
07:31 - Loop okay then 720 scaled by 1.5 divided
07:38 - 2 is 540 the amount to scroll by that is
07:41 - change X by
07:45 - 540 to keep the cycle going and the less
07:48 - value above that's half of that number
07:51 - again
07:53 - 270 only remember it must be negative so
07:56 - that's
07:58 - 270 let's run this thing and this time
08:03 - it just keeps on scrolling
08:06 - forever excellent that's exactly what we
08:10 - wanted and you know that might just do
08:13 - but I would prefer to also give us a bit
08:15 - of vertical movement too as we move up
08:18 - and down the level so as you might
08:20 - expect that requires not a change y
08:22 - actually but a set y position block
08:25 - because it's based directly off the
08:27 - camera y now so first we need that
08:30 - subtract block as the camera Y is always
08:34 - inverted and then we'll pop in the value
08:37 - 100 on the left if I do set the position
08:40 - to 100 over here you'll see this brings
08:42 - the background right up so that we even
08:44 - see a bit of a gap at the bottom this is
08:47 - okay though because it will always be
08:48 - hidden behind the floor and it maximizes
08:51 - our scroll height now on to the right we
08:54 - want another divide block dividing
08:56 - camera y Again by 10 10 and that's for
09:00 - that Parallax effect and that should be
09:03 - that let's give it a
09:06 - test H I got to say it's hard to tell
09:09 - that it changed did you see anything
09:12 - perhaps better to try it on some stairs
09:15 - later on in the
09:17 - level ah yes if you watch the top of the
09:20 - screen you can see that it's slowly
09:22 - making its way down with us now
09:24 - hurah so that is pretty much it except
09:29 - the really observant ones among us might
09:32 - have noticed that when we die and
09:33 - respawn the background is left one frame
09:37 - behind the
09:38 - level we can fix that OCD nightmare by
09:42 - introducing a when I
09:44 - receive reset level and then simply drop
09:48 - in a copy of the set Y2 script from down
09:51 - here and that should ensure the position
09:53 - is set as soon as the level resets just
09:56 - need to get back to a high point to test
09:58 - it
10:04 - and yes that was much better great job
10:09 - and as much as I hate to say it that is
10:12 - where I'm going to have to leave you
10:14 - today but fear not I have a stoning next
10:18 - episode already in the works where we
10:20 - will finally be bringing our level to an
10:23 - end in glorious Geometry Dash style
10:26 - would you look at that awesome
10:29 - so please hit the like button and
10:31 - subscribe to the channel now checking
10:33 - the Bell icon to ensure that you get
10:35 - notified the moment my next video drops
10:38 - yeah I couldn't help but notice that
10:40 - most of the scratchers commenting on my
10:42 - videos haven't publicly at least
10:45 - subscribed so if that is you do consider
10:48 - subbing as I would absolutely love to
10:50 - get closer to that amazing golden play
10:52 - button you know you want to see me unbox
10:55 - that too don't you ha so that is it

hello fellow scratchers today I want to quickly dive back into our Geometry Dash series because oh no some of you may well have experienced this horrendous bug if that is you then I am so sorry and I'll explain why and how to fix it in just a moment but for the rest of you fear not we also have some new content do you see what it is oh man yes The Parallax scrolling background At Last I really
