00:01 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff batch
00:04 - and we're back for the second part of
00:05 - episode 19 of the mario tile scrolling
00:08 - series we have made great progress
00:10 - adding fire flowers to this game we've
00:12 - got the power-up collectible via mario
00:14 - costumes we can power up we can fire the
00:17 - projectiles only well they appear more
00:19 - like fireball cannons at present so our
00:22 - next step is clear let's get scratching
00:27 - right so they are supposed to be
00:29 - bouncing right
00:30 - so they need gravity we've certainly
00:32 - covered this enough times before to know
00:35 - what to do first check that the
00:36 - fireballs are not falling at their
00:38 - maximum speed already if speed y is
00:41 - greater than minus 12
00:44 - then we can apply gravity to them by
00:46 - changing speed y by negative 1.5 feel
00:50 - free to play with these numbers to get a
00:52 - good feel to the bounce of the
00:53 - projectiles
00:55 - then we use our handcrafted move sprite
00:57 - y block to do the job
01:04 - okay wow we've created something special
01:08 - here they certainly like to hug the
01:10 - floor don't they
01:11 - what we need here is some bounce
01:14 - now we could look for speed y being zero
01:16 - like we did with the speed x but we need
01:18 - to watch out for bounces off the ceiling
01:20 - too
01:21 - so instead we'll use an if falling
01:24 - equals zero as this is only set to zero
01:26 - when we are physically on the floor and
01:29 - not a ceiling
01:31 - then to bounce back up we set speed y to
01:34 - 11.
01:35 - where do i get these numbers from
01:37 - they are just trial and error nothing
01:39 - scientific or complex just playing
01:41 - around with them like i encourage you to
01:42 - do too
01:43 - smash the green flag and bask in the
01:46 - wonder of our fantastic bouncing
01:48 - fireballs oh yeah fire mario is turning
01:51 - out great what do you think so far have
01:54 - you noticed anything missing
01:56 - yes a few things perhaps but right off
01:59 - what about mario's throw animation it
02:01 - looks like he's just popping fireballs
02:03 - out of his head
02:07 - take a look in our mario costumes
02:10 - scrolling down into the bottom costumes
02:12 - 29 and 30 are the special throwing
02:15 - costumes i was talking about we can
02:17 - certainly use these
02:19 - come back into the mario code and we'll
02:21 - make a new variable named throw
02:25 - for this sprite only
02:26 - we will use this to keep track of when
02:28 - to play back the throwing animation
02:31 - find the define handle keys fire script
02:34 - now after changing fireballs by one we
02:36 - can also set throw to two this is
02:40 - because we have two costumes to animate
02:42 - over when we throw a fireball
02:44 - next up find the define paint sprite
02:47 - script this is where we do all the
02:49 - costume switching
02:51 - we'll try adding this right near the top
02:52 - as it overrides most of the other
02:54 - actions
02:56 - so if throw is greater than zero
03:02 - then well change throw by negative um
03:06 - i'm gonna say negative 0.25 that would
03:09 - take four frames to move on to the next
03:11 - throwing costume
03:13 - right
03:14 - put a switch costume to block before the
03:16 - change throw block and borrow the same
03:19 - join as we always do here
03:21 - but because we want the costume frame
03:23 - number add another join on the right
03:26 - hand side and write throw with a capital
03:29 - t on the left and on the right we want
03:31 - the number one or two
03:33 - for that we'll use the ceiling of throw
03:36 - the ceiling operator rounds numbers up
03:38 - to the nearest whole number so 1.1 would
03:41 - still round up to 2.
03:43 - nearly forgot pop in a stop this script
03:46 - at the end so we don't continue on and
03:48 - set the costume to something else
03:51 - testing the throwing animation now
03:56 - it works yes and it looks great hoorah
04:00 - right i wonder who of you has spotted
04:02 - one other issue we have been having
04:05 - that the projectiles can actually
04:07 - sometimes double register a hit
04:09 - you can hear it sometimes as the
04:11 - collision sound gets played multiple
04:12 - times
04:13 - this has actually been an issue for some
04:15 - time where a flipped enemy is able to be
04:17 - flipped over and over especially using
04:20 - koopa shells this is such a quick fix
04:23 - why don't we squish that now we just
04:25 - need to prevent already flipping enemies
04:27 - from being flipped again
04:29 - click into the enemy sprite and find the
04:31 - when i receive move player after enemy
04:34 - script this is where we check for
04:36 - collisions that will cause an enemy to
04:37 - be flipped
04:38 - so slip a new if at the top of the
04:41 - script
04:44 - and check if type equals flip
04:49 - this is true when the sprite is already
04:51 - flipping so simply stop this script to
04:54 - prevent us from even checking for a flip
04:56 - again against this sprite
04:58 - i want to try to give that a test
05:03 - the trick is hitting the same enemy
05:04 - twice
05:06 - okay that looked good just a few more
05:08 - tests i'm not sure i hit on that time
05:12 - yeah that was a direct hit and it looked
05:14 - good
05:15 - bug squashed
05:18 - so next bug
05:20 - and that's if enemies drop off the
05:22 - bottom of the level they don't despawn
05:25 - this is not the end of the world but it
05:27 - does now cause a problem if one of our
05:29 - fireballs falls off the bottom can you
05:31 - guess why
05:32 - yes because our fireballs count we'll
05:35 - never go back down we need to despawn
05:37 - these fireballs
05:39 - in the enemy sprite find the define move
05:41 - enemy script
05:45 - then after the initial check for a type
05:47 - of flip we'll add in a new if checking
05:50 - if y is less than
05:52 - negative 32 that should be just enough
05:55 - off the bottom of the screen for most
05:56 - situations
05:57 - and we use our new delete clone custom
06:00 - block that ensures it counts down the
06:02 - fireballs do
06:04 - you know while we are here let's replace
06:06 - these other two usages of delete this
06:08 - sprite with our new delete clone custom
06:10 - block phew good catch there
06:14 - and lastly since we are talking about
06:16 - sprites going out of range let's find
06:18 - the define tick fireball script
06:21 - our fireballs should not keep on flying
06:23 - across the level once they move off the
06:25 - left or right side of the screen either
06:27 - after moving in the x direction down
06:29 - here
06:30 - let's check if the abs the absolute
06:32 - value
06:38 - of x
06:39 - subtract
06:41 - camera x
06:43 - is greater than
06:44 - 240
06:46 - that means it's gone off the left or
06:48 - right side of the screen
06:49 - then also delete clone using the new
06:53 - custom block
06:55 - that's easy to test we just need to fire
06:57 - rapidly off the edge of the screen like
06:59 - so and if we can keep firing then yay it
07:02 - has worked
07:03 - [Music]
07:04 - splendid are you feeling as good about
07:07 - this as me
07:09 - well then is now a good time for me to
07:11 - share with you a potential spanner in
07:13 - the works perhaps you've also been
07:16 - noticing one other flaw in our fireball
07:18 - implementation and that is that a single
07:21 - fireball can kill a whole screen of
07:24 - enemies if you fire it off in just the
07:26 - right place
07:28 - a cool perk perhaps but not how mario's
07:30 - fireballs are supposed to work these
07:32 - ones are supposed to destroy one enemy
07:35 - but also be destroyed themselves in the
07:37 - impact
07:38 - so how do we pull that one off
07:41 - well i tried a number of different ways
07:43 - of doing this before i settled on my
07:45 - favorite solution it was especially
07:47 - difficult to get the projectiles to
07:48 - detect they had collided with an enemy
07:50 - but not trigger when two projectiles hit
07:53 - each other wiping each other out but
07:55 - this is a similar issue to our deadly
07:57 - enemy problem from the cooper shell
07:59 - episode
08:00 - and so you may not be surprised that i
08:02 - have a similar solution if you can't
08:04 - remember how we did that i advise you to
08:06 - go re-watch that episode
08:08 - here are the position tiles and move
08:11 - player after enemy event receivers that
08:13 - we set up to hide the non-deadly enemies
08:15 - while keeping the deadly koopa shells
08:17 - visible all time
08:19 - to explain my thinking let's click into
08:21 - the mario sprite and find the highest
08:24 - the define game loop script
08:27 - at present all sprites are visible after
08:30 - the move player event has run but then
08:32 - in the move enemy event all non-deadly
08:35 - enemy sprites are hidden
08:37 - next up the move player after enemy
08:39 - event runs and this is also used in the
08:42 - enemy's sprite to detect when a deadly
08:44 - enemy touches a non-deadly one killing
08:46 - the enemy this is now including
08:48 - fireballs hitting enemies
08:51 - and lastly in the position tile script
08:53 - all the sprites are made fully visible
08:55 - again end of game tick and good job
08:59 - but we now want to detect when an enemy
09:01 - fireball collides with a non-deadly
09:03 - enemy for that we need to hide all the
09:06 - fireballs but show all the other enemy
09:09 - sprites
09:12 - we'll broadcast a new event for this
09:16 - naming it hide fireballs
09:22 - then we'll broadcast another new event
09:24 - naming it check fireballs
09:27 - in which we can check for collisions
09:30 - so drop both of these before the
09:32 - broadcast position tiles
09:34 - excellent now we just need to make this
09:37 - work click back into the enemy sprite
09:42 - we start with the when i receive hide
09:45 - fireballs
09:49 - if type equals fireball
09:58 - then we hide it of course
10:03 - then stop this script because there's a
10:05 - little more to do
10:07 - if this is any other visible enemy then
10:10 - we actually want to show it
10:12 - just borrow that script from the
10:13 - position tiles event receiver it should
10:16 - say if visible is greater than zero then
10:18 - show
10:20 - this sets us up to detect collisions
10:22 - between the fireballs and any other
10:24 - enemy if you need a refresher as to why
10:27 - then do re-watch the previous episode
10:30 - want to give that a quick test just to
10:32 - ensure things are working as before
10:39 - great but to delete the fireballs
10:41 - correctly on impact we need to code the
10:43 - when i receive check viable script
10:48 - again if type equals fireball
10:57 - and now we can borrow the scripts from
10:59 - the move player after enemy event
11:02 - show the single fireball
11:04 - check if it touches any other visible
11:06 - enemy
11:07 - do something and then hide it again
11:09 - ready for the next fireball to be
11:11 - checked
11:12 - this showing and re-hiding is what stops
11:14 - the two fireballs from destroying each
11:16 - other as you will never have more than
11:18 - one visible at a time
11:20 - but we don't want to cause a fireball
11:22 - enemy to flip so remove that
11:24 - instead we want to use our delete clone
11:27 - custom block
11:28 - right
11:29 - that felt both simple and complex at the
11:32 - same time i guess it's not much coding
11:34 - but you have to get things set up just
11:37 - right in order for it to work let's give
11:39 - it a test are you ready for this one
11:42 - fireball one enemy test coming up
11:44 - boom that is what i'm talking about so
11:47 - let's test a bit more
11:54 - [Music]
12:00 - this sure is fun but it's hard to test
12:02 - whether two fireballs can collide with
12:04 - each other so let's temporarily up the
12:07 - maximum number of fireballs
12:09 - that's in the mario sprite under handle
12:12 - keys fire
12:14 - i'll just up the fireballs to 20
12:21 - and look at this this is crazy
12:23 - satisfying why doesn't mario have a 20
12:26 - fireball limit
12:28 - anyway certainly overlapping fireballs
12:31 - is not a problem here
12:32 - yeah well that brings a whole new
12:35 - dimension to the game doesn't it
12:37 - now although that was far too much fun
12:39 - i'm going to pop the maximum fireballs
12:41 - back down to 2.
12:43 - so there's not a lot left to do here the
12:46 - final remaining tweak is to simply fix
12:48 - what happens when mario gets hurt as
12:50 - fire mario at present we shrink back to
12:52 - classic mario size but in reality at
12:55 - least in smb3 we should only downgrade
12:58 - as far as the main super mario player
13:00 - state
13:01 - we have an event receiver for this in
13:03 - the main mario sprite
13:05 - find that when i receive mario hurt
13:07 - script the top script is handling
13:09 - invulnerability and losing a life if you
13:11 - are mini mario so scroll down
13:15 - and here we set invulnerability to 70.
13:18 - we now check for which mario we
13:20 - currently are
13:21 - using if else
13:23 - and check for mario equals fire
13:28 - so the existing loop transformations can
13:31 - go in the else but pop the broadcast to
13:34 - continue the game loop to after the if
13:37 - as we'll want this in both cases
13:40 - right to downgrade from fire mario to
13:43 - super mario we set the mario variable to
13:46 - mario with the capital m
13:48 - and then force them to update their
13:50 - costume using a paint sprite
13:53 - now i want to pause the game and flash
13:55 - the player to indicate the change of
13:56 - state that's easy we use repeat 30 and
14:00 - keep the broadcast position tiles
14:03 - the flashing is already accounted for by
14:05 - the invulnerability available that we
14:06 - set
14:08 - and here we go so as fire mario we just
14:12 - need to touch
14:14 - oh hey come back
14:15 - oh man never trust a gumba to do what
14:18 - you want fine let's face off with a
14:20 - piranha plant
14:22 - brilliant that was just what i was
14:24 - hoping it would look like
14:27 - just what i needed
14:28 - [Music]
14:40 - ah another bug oh the purple square
14:45 - when we downgrade while still throwing a
14:48 - fireball
14:49 - no
14:55 - quickly back to the mario hurt receiver
15:00 - we can prevent this easily by adding a
15:02 - set throw to zero after setting the
15:04 - invulnerability to zero but before the
15:06 - animation plays
15:08 - phew
15:10 - [Music]
15:24 - and that is such good news because my
15:26 - fellow scratchers this is most
15:28 - definitely the end of today's episode i
15:31 - feel like we've had to do such a lot of
15:32 - scripting and i hope i didn't lose you
15:34 - the end result though is so satisfying
15:37 - and i think we are ever closer to having
15:39 - covered almost everything that you will
15:41 - need to make the most incredible games
15:43 - of your own
15:44 - be it mario or any other tile-based

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers i'm griff batch and we're back for the second part of episode 19 of the mario tile scrolling series we have made great progress adding fire flowers to this game we've got the powerup collectible via mario costumes we can power up we can fire the projectiles only well they appear more like fireball cannons at present so our next step is clear let's get scratching right so they are supposed to be bouncing right so they need gravity we've certainly covered this enough times before to know what to do first check that the fireballs are not falling at their maximum speed already if speed y is greater than minus 12 then we can apply gravity to them by changing speed y by negative 1.5 feel free to play with these numbers to get a good feel to the bounce of the projectiles then we use our handcrafted move sprite y block to do the job okay wow we've created something special here they certainly like to hug the floor don't they what we need here is some bounce now we could look for speed y being zero like we did with the speed x but we need to watch out for bounces off the ceiling too so instead we'll use an if falling equals zero as this is only set to zero when we are physically on the floor and not a ceiling then to bounce back up we set speed y to 11. where do i get these numbers from they are just trial and error nothing scientific or complex just playing around with them like i encourage you to do too smash the green flag and bask in the wonder of our fantastic bouncing fireballs oh yeah fire mario is turning out great what do you think so far have you noticed anything missing yes a few things perhaps but right off what about mario's throw animation it looks like he's just popping fireballs out of his head take a look in our mario costumes scrolling down into the bottom costumes 29 and 30 are the special throwing costumes i was talking about we can certainly use these come back into the mario code and we'll make a new variable named throw for this sprite only we will use this to keep track of when to play back the throwing animation find the define handle keys fire script now after changing fireballs by one we can also set throw to two this is because we have two costumes to animate over when we throw a fireball next up find the define paint sprite script this is where we do all the costume switching we'll try adding this right near the top as it overrides most of the other actions so if throw is greater than zero then well change throw by negative um i'm gonna say negative 0.25 that would take four frames to move on to the next throwing costume right put a switch costume to block before the change throw block and borrow the same join as we always do here but because we want the costume frame number add another join on the right hand side and write throw with a capital t on the left and on the right we want the number one or two for that we'll use the ceiling of throw the ceiling operator rounds numbers up to the nearest whole number so 1.1 would still round up to 2. nearly forgot pop in a stop this script at the end so we don't continue on and set the costume to something else testing the throwing animation now it works yes and it looks great hoorah right i wonder who of you has spotted one other issue we have been having that the projectiles can actually sometimes double register a hit you can hear it sometimes as the collision sound gets played multiple times this has actually been an issue for some time where a flipped enemy is able to be flipped over and over especially using koopa shells this is such a quick fix why don't we squish that now we just need to prevent already flipping enemies from being flipped again click into the enemy sprite and find the when i receive move player after enemy script this is where we check for collisions that will cause an enemy to be flipped so slip a new if at the top of the script and check if type equals flip this is true when the sprite is already flipping so simply stop this script to prevent us from even checking for a flip again against this sprite i want to try to give that a test the trick is hitting the same enemy twice okay that looked good just a few more tests i'm not sure i hit on that time yeah that was a direct hit and it looked good bug squashed so next bug and that's if enemies drop off the bottom of the level they don't despawn this is not the end of the world but it does now cause a problem if one of our fireballs falls off the bottom can you guess why yes because our fireballs count we'll never go back down we need to despawn these fireballs in the enemy sprite find the define move enemy script then after the initial check for a type of flip we'll add in a new if checking if y is less than negative 32 that should be just enough off the bottom of the screen for most situations and we use our new delete clone custom block that ensures it counts down the fireballs do you know while we are here let's replace these other two usages of delete this sprite with our new delete clone custom block phew good catch there and lastly since we are talking about sprites going out of range let's find the define tick fireball script our fireballs should not keep on flying across the level once they move off the left or right side of the screen either after moving in the x direction down here let's check if the abs the absolute value of x subtract camera x is greater than 240 that means it's gone off the left or right side of the screen then also delete clone using the new custom block that's easy to test we just need to fire rapidly off the edge of the screen like so and if we can keep firing then yay it has worked splendid are you feeling as good about this as me well then is now a good time for me to share with you a potential spanner in the works perhaps you've also been noticing one other flaw in our fireball implementation and that is that a single fireball can kill a whole screen of enemies if you fire it off in just the right place a cool perk perhaps but not how mario's fireballs are supposed to work these ones are supposed to destroy one enemy but also be destroyed themselves in the impact so how do we pull that one off well i tried a number of different ways of doing this before i settled on my favorite solution it was especially difficult to get the projectiles to detect they had collided with an enemy but not trigger when two projectiles hit each other wiping each other out but this is a similar issue to our deadly enemy problem from the cooper shell episode and so you may not be surprised that i have a similar solution if you can't remember how we did that i advise you to go rewatch that episode here are the position tiles and move player after enemy event receivers that we set up to hide the nondeadly enemies while keeping the deadly koopa shells visible all time to explain my thinking let's click into the mario sprite and find the highest the define game loop script at present all sprites are visible after the move player event has run but then in the move enemy event all nondeadly enemy sprites are hidden next up the move player after enemy event runs and this is also used in the enemy's sprite to detect when a deadly enemy touches a nondeadly one killing the enemy this is now including fireballs hitting enemies and lastly in the position tile script all the sprites are made fully visible again end of game tick and good job but we now want to detect when an enemy fireball collides with a nondeadly enemy for that we need to hide all the fireballs but show all the other enemy sprites we'll broadcast a new event for this naming it hide fireballs then we'll broadcast another new event naming it check fireballs in which we can check for collisions so drop both of these before the broadcast position tiles excellent now we just need to make this work click back into the enemy sprite we start with the when i receive hide fireballs if type equals fireball then we hide it of course then stop this script because there's a little more to do if this is any other visible enemy then we actually want to show it

you need a refresher as to why then do rewatch the previous episode want to give that a quick test just to ensure things are working as before great but to delete the fireballs correctly on impact we need to code the when i receive check viable script again if type equals fireball and now we can borrow the scripts from the move player after enemy event show the single fireball check if it touches any other visible enemy do something and then hide it again ready for the next fireball to be checked this showing and rehiding is what stops the two fireballs from destroying each other as you will never have more than one visible at a time but we don't want to cause a fireball enemy to flip so remove that instead we want to use our delete clone custom block right that felt both simple and complex at the same time i guess it's not much coding but you have to get things set up just right in order for it to work let's give it a test are you ready for this one fireball one enemy test coming up boom that is what i'm talking about so let's test a bit more this sure is fun but it's hard to test whether two fireballs can collide with each other so let's temporarily up the maximum number of fireballs that's in the mario sprite under handle keys fire i'll just up the fireballs to 20 and look at this this is crazy satisfying why doesn't mario have a 20 fireball limit anyway certainly overlapping fireballs is not a problem here yeah well that brings a whole new dimension to the game doesn't it now although that was far too much fun i'm going to pop the maximum fireballs back down to 2. so there's not a lot left to do here the final remaining tweak is to simply fix what happens when mario gets hurt as fire mario at present we shrink back to classic mario size but in reality at least in smb3 we should only downgrade as far as the main super mario player state we have an event receiver for this in the main mario sprite find that when i receive mario hurt script the top script is handling invulnerability and losing a life if you are mini mario so scroll down and here we set invulnerability to 70. we now check for which mario we currently are using if else and check for mario equals fire so the existing loop transformations can go in the else but pop the broadcast to continue the game loop to after the if as we'll want this in both cases right to downgrade from fire mario to super mario we set the mario variable to mario with the capital m and then force them to update their costume using a paint sprite now i want to pause the game and flash the player to indicate the change of state that's easy we use repeat 30 and keep the broadcast position tiles the flashing is already accounted for by the invulnerability available that we set and here we go so as fire mario we just need to touch oh hey come back oh man never trust a gumba to do what you want fine let's face off with a piranha plant brilliant that was just what i was hoping it would look like just what i needed ah another bug oh the purple square when we downgrade while still throwing a fireball no quickly back to the mario hurt receiver we can prevent this easily by adding a set throw to zero after setting the invulnerability to zero but before the animation plays phew and that is such good news because my fellow scratchers this is most definitely the end of today's episode i feel like we've had to do such a lot of scripting and i hope i didn't lose you the end result though is so satisfying and i think we are ever closer to having covered almost everything that you will
