00:01 - hi and welcome back to part 8 of my
00:05 - scratch tutorial on creating a scrolling
00:09 - platformer now today we are going to
00:11 - look at vertical scrolling so this is
00:14 - level 2 which is in the final version of
00:17 - the software and you'll notice as we
00:19 - jump up here we're able to move up the
00:22 - level now that we can't do at the moment
00:24 - in the current version that we've worked
00:25 - on so far so this is what we're going to
00:27 - look at now so let me just close this
00:30 - and we'll go back to where we left off
00:31 - last time so where we left it last time
00:36 - we can scroll left and right and just
00:39 - quickly go off the end of this level and
00:41 - you'll see that we have our next level
00:44 - coming which is great but absolutely no
00:47 - movement up and down so let's first of
00:49 - all just tidy up the project just to get
00:51 - us before we start doing anything new
00:53 - let's get rid of this clicked max
00:55 - because we don't need to see that
00:56 - anymore so in variables we can just get
00:58 - rid of that by clicking the box there
01:01 - and also on the start this level we've
01:04 - still got this little bit of lava left
01:05 - over from when we were testing let's
01:07 - just tidy that up as well by going into
01:10 - danger and level 1 and let's just remove
01:15 - both those bits of lava with the Delete
01:18 - key like that and that's good we're now
01:21 - ready to get going so first of all let's
01:24 - make it so when we play this game what
01:27 - we can do at the moment you can walk
01:28 - left and right let's stop us from
01:30 - walking too far to the left so if you go
01:34 - into the scripts of player 1 into the
01:38 - TIC custom block and we scroll down to
01:45 - the part where we're doing the scrolling
01:47 - we've got the set scroll X here all we
01:50 - need to do is say that we don't want
01:52 - scroll X to be less than 0 because 0 is
01:54 - where we're starting here where this
01:55 - green starts at scroll 0 and you can
01:59 - simply do that by adding in an if
02:01 - statement after we set the scroll just
02:03 - there like that and
02:08 - compared using a less than operator and
02:12 - we need the variable scroll X on the
02:17 - left hand side and 0 on the right so we
02:21 - set the scroll to be the position of the
02:22 - player and then check to see whether
02:24 - it's moved less than 0 and if it has
02:27 - what we need to do is set it back to 0
02:31 - again this is the effect of never
02:35 - letting score let's go less than 0 so if
02:37 - it sets the small X less than 0 it
02:39 - compares it and then we'll move it back
02:41 - to 0 again if it's bigger than 0 it just
02:43 - let it be
02:44 - so that allowance should mean that now
02:47 - we can scroll right if we go left stop
02:50 - scrolling see that it's not neat really
02:55 - easy ok so let's work on movement in the
03:02 - up direction to do that let's move on to
03:06 - level 2 because level 2 is going to be
03:08 - the one that lets us do the up and down
03:10 - movement so or to do that quickly in our
03:13 - when we start this again the play game a
03:15 - receiver set level 2 2 to start with and
03:19 - I when we start our game we'll be
03:20 - starting on level 2 see it makes life
03:23 - easy to test so let's put a little bit
03:29 - of height in this level first just so we
03:30 - can test it so go into the costumes of
03:33 - platforms and let's just add in another
03:36 - bit of platform we can use copy and
03:38 - paste on this just to quickly duplicate
03:41 - it like that and put it a bit higher up
03:44 - we'll make it smaller
03:46 - ok so there's something for us to jump
03:48 - onto hopefully we can reach that yeah
03:51 - let's just give that a quick go to make
03:53 - sure we can
03:54 - oh no too high
03:57 - let's slow it down a bit like eights try
03:59 - that yeah that's good ok and now let's
04:05 - make another one a little bit higher up
04:07 - again like that okay so now
04:15 - to the top of the screen now but we're
04:18 - not scrolling okay so back to the code
04:19 - and this is in again the player sprite
04:22 - in the tick just where we had the other
04:24 - scrolling instructions so the simplest
04:27 - way of doing it is simply to have
04:31 - another set just before the position
04:33 - down here set scroll Y to the Y position
04:40 - of the character pretty obvious really
04:43 - let's give it a go there we go already
04:47 - it Scrolls both directions but you
04:49 - notice that easy did you maybe you did
04:50 - maybe you tried it if you did good for
04:52 - you now that's great but upon with
04:56 - jumping is that it means that the screen
04:58 - is gonna be bouncing up and down up and
05:01 - down up and down all the time and that's
05:04 - a little bit irritating for the user and
05:06 - they might get a bit dizzy after playing
05:08 - it too long so it'd be better if we were
05:10 - able to not bounce the screen around
05:12 - quite so much and for that you need
05:14 - smooth scrolling and what that means is
05:18 - it doesn't just suddenly jump exactly to
05:21 - where the player is moving to the screen
05:23 - will scroll slightly behind the player
05:24 - kind of averaging out his movement now
05:28 - to do this we can just change the way
05:29 - our sets while Y works okay
05:32 - oh stop did game now so a little bit of
05:36 - information first at the moment we're
05:37 - setting scroll Y to Y now if we were to
05:40 - instead use a change
05:42 - scroll Y in here instead of the set okay
05:49 - now if we score it change it by one of
05:52 - course we were in the game it's gonna
05:54 - slowly smoothly scroll up the screen
05:56 - because we're changing the scroll the
05:58 - whole time okay but that's not what we
06:01 - want to do what we want to change the Y
06:03 - by is the amount that it will take to
06:07 - get us to where the player is now now to
06:10 - do that you need to know that the
06:11 - distance between the player and the
06:13 - current scrolling position now up to do
06:16 - that it's quite easy all you need is the
06:20 - position that you want it to scroll to
06:22 - which is the current player position
06:24 - take away the
06:26 - of the scroll at the moment so if we're
06:30 - scrolling at the moment was at the
06:31 - middle of the screen at zero and we were
06:33 - hundred higher we want to change the
06:35 - scroll by a hundred to get to where
06:37 - where the player is now so a hundred is
06:40 - where is now Scrolls at zero 100 taker a
06:43 - zero is a hundred so if we change scroll
06:46 - by a hundred we will actually get back
06:47 - to where we were meant to be so if you
06:49 - were not now we get exactly the same as
06:52 - setting scroll Y to the play position so
06:58 - that's no different but it sets this up
07:01 - to do smooth scrolling because rather
07:05 - than saying we want to move by the whole
07:07 - distance between the player and the
07:09 - current score position we want to say we
07:11 - want to move it a bit of the distance
07:13 - and that can be done with division or
07:16 - multiplication you can choose if we use
07:18 - division be easier to understand so we
07:22 - want to move by the distance between the
07:25 - player and the scroll but we want to do
07:27 - it over ten game frames so if we were
07:33 - now on watch it might see how the
07:37 - scrolling up is now slower than the
07:39 - player jumping so the player can jump
07:41 - and it's not such a harsh and jump on
07:45 - the user it's not licking around all
07:47 - over the place now one more change I
07:53 - would suggest we do is rather than just
07:55 - allowing us to be moving by this amount
07:59 - divided by ten the problem we have here
08:01 - is if we're dividing by ten on numbers
08:04 - are no longer than it be whole numbers
08:06 - not me one two three they're going to be
08:07 - one point two one point seven and when
08:11 - you're positioning scratch sprites in
08:13 - scratch it's better to keep them rounded
08:15 - to the nearest whole number so I would
08:19 - advise using this round and putting that
08:24 - around the entire change scroll like
08:27 - that so we're changing it by the rounded
08:29 - value of the distance between the player
08:32 - and the scroll divided by ten and that
08:34 - just keeps things all nice and a level
08:36 - it'll help with the cage detection and
08:39 - various things like that I'm not
08:40 - entirely sure how relevant that isn't
08:42 - scratched three it might be better to
08:43 - scratch Li than to button to definitely
08:45 - needed to do that so I suggest I would
08:47 - suggest doing that now anyway
08:49 - okay next thing then now that we can
08:53 - scroll up and down what about when we
08:55 - fall off the edge because you don't want
08:56 - to really see yourself die like that
08:59 - because you no longer touching the
09:00 - bottom so what we can do here is stop
09:03 - the player at this level from scrolling
09:05 - down any further down the starting
09:07 - position just like we did for moving too
09:09 - far left so again in the tick custom
09:13 - block just before we do the position
09:15 - added another if just like this one like
09:21 - this and this time we'll check scroll Y
09:25 - being less than 0 and if it is set
09:29 - scroll Y to 0 yeah that say if I will
09:32 - just try that again
09:34 - that should mean now if I fall off it
09:37 - doesn't scroll down but it does scroll
09:41 - up and that's really nice now smooth
09:47 - scrolling you could of course do the
09:49 - same smooth scrolling on the left and
09:50 - right as well at the moment it perfectly
09:53 - Scrolls after my character but you could
09:56 - if you wanted instead of having this set
09:59 - small X to X you could do a change for
10:01 - all X by round of X takeaways for all X
10:04 - divided by 10 or by another number the
10:07 - bigger this number the longer it takes
10:08 - the screen to catch up the smallest
10:10 - number the more it will be just stick
10:13 - stuck to the player sounds up to you in
10:15 - this particular game I quite like it
10:17 - being stuck in the middle so I'm going
10:18 - to leave it like that but you can choose
10:19 - to try that out if you like so what does
10:23 - that leave for this tutorial not much
10:25 - really all that I really want to do is
10:27 - actually build upon this level and make
10:29 - it a bigger level so why not have some
10:32 - fun changing the costumes and adding
10:34 - some more to this level so let's have a
10:37 - look that's in the platforms in the
10:42 - costumes let's just stop this now
10:45 - let's change this level a little bit so
10:49 - we've already started to build up this
10:51 - little jumping thing slow why not let's
10:53 - just stay with that shall we
10:55 - but let's add in a next part that's
10:57 - duplicate this sprite and we're gonna
11:00 - build up above this level here so to do
11:03 - that we're going to have to pretend that
11:07 - we're down here and we're jumping up
11:09 - from below so we've just got to this one
11:12 - here which was gonna be around here ish
11:14 - so let's make him jump maybe to the left
11:17 - to a platform down here like this and
11:22 - then back maybe a bit further jump to
11:25 - here okay let's just give that a go so
11:30 - let's see what we need to do is this is
11:31 - level 2 2 which is great then I'm doing
11:33 - this all nicely in line with how we
11:36 - wanted to do it so in the platform
11:40 - scripts we moved down to where we're
11:44 - starting level 2 in the setup what we
11:47 - need is there one of these clone blocks
11:49 - to create the second part of the level
11:52 - above the last one so for that to work
11:54 - we have to position it at 0 which means
11:57 - we're not moving across and then this
11:59 - one here is for moving up so let's move
12:01 - it up by I'm not quite sure what to do
12:03 - at the moment so let's just choose a
12:04 - number like 200 and just see what
12:06 - happens ok let's run that ok it was not
12:11 - anywhere near enough so it's actually
12:13 - still quite low down so let's move it up
12:15 - let's try 400 run that ok better bit too
12:22 - high now so let's move it down a little
12:23 - bit more let's try 350 ok
12:30 - that's more like it and look with this
12:33 - jump here we can actually afford to make
12:35 - it quite a bit further we can jump quite
12:37 - far there so let's just tweak that level
12:40 - and move it further across like that
12:45 - let's add a little bit
12:47 - more level on them says duplicate to
12:49 - this costume so now let's make a bit to
12:51 - the right of this that's of a circle to
12:54 - jump on to okay and I'll just oops I'll
13:00 - just delete these this levels really
13:04 - very white isn't it we can do so about
13:07 - that later on just copy and paste these
13:11 - circles naturally what I really want is
13:14 - some danger on these levels so things
13:17 - that can kill you let's add in hey yeah
13:21 - big nasty red lava like so inside these
13:32 - ones and I'm gonna multi select these
13:35 - heading shift and fill them in white as
13:37 - well and then move them to the front
13:45 - okay so let's position this on our game
13:48 - now so we're going to put it here to the
13:53 - right of the other sprites 11 this level
13:56 - so go into the code I'll duplicate that
14:00 - and I want it to be to the right of this
14:02 - so I'll move it along by I'll do 360
14:07 - just to see how that works I don't want
14:09 - it to be any higher so let's just run
14:14 - now to see what happens okay it's not
14:22 - bad I'd actually prefer to
14:24 - more to the right so let's just tweak
14:25 - that and add in 152 I say oh yes good
14:33 - now the moment course we will not die on
14:36 - the red because we changed our scripts
14:38 - so that our red parts have to be in
14:40 - danger so let's just fix that so if we
14:44 - go into the costumes first of all what
14:48 - have we got in danger let's just check
14:49 - level 2 1 so we've got that bit
14:53 - we need this bit and we need this new
14:58 - bit as well so to go into there so we've
15:01 - got the same sprites but we can clear
15:05 - this because we don't want this bit of
15:06 - level to be dangerous delete that and in
15:09 - this sprite we want to remove the white
15:13 - parts leaving the danger okay and then
15:18 - go back into your platforms and remove
15:21 - the red bit okay and now once we've
15:23 - deleted that go into your code and we
15:27 - need to duplicate the level cloning from
15:31 - level 2 into the danger too so just drag
15:34 - that part of the cloning into the danger
15:38 - and this needs to move in to level 2 to
15:43 - exactly the same positions so now when
15:45 - we play the game we should find that the
15:52 - danger is there again and now we can die
15:54 - in it great
15:57 - now I'm noticing that we are starting up
15:59 - here that's curious isn't it sped again
16:03 - now why is that
16:05 - are we not setting our scroll X at the
16:07 - beginning of the game let's call Y sorry
16:09 - let's see where's the race set so we're
16:13 - setting we really aren't
16:18 - that's bad ok we need to fix that we
16:22 - need to set our scroll X and scroll Y
16:24 - the beginning here in game on otherwise
16:27 - the game will not start at night
16:32 - position so set scroll X
16:36 - and setscore y20 just here now when we
16:46 - die it repositions it's at the stars
16:51 - level so the only thing left to do is to
16:54 - put the exit this exit here at the end
16:59 - oh not the only thing what one thing to
17:01 - do we've also got to do the collectables
17:02 - - they've got to get the exit to be here
17:05 - at the end of the game so how do we do
17:07 - that
17:07 - you remember you put your mouse where
17:09 - you want it to be while the game is
17:10 - running and you press M it gives us the
17:14 - position that we need to set it to click
17:16 - in to exit and in the level 2 part which
17:21 - is this one we need to enter in that
17:23 - number so 7 4 4 by 1 4 7 8 4 7 8 ok hide
17:34 - the mouse just check that that
17:36 - positioned correctly yep there it is
17:44 - and so one more thing to do is adding
17:47 - some more nice collectables to get while
17:49 - you were playing the game so let's just
17:50 - start the level again and we're putting
17:53 - some collectibles so let's put one in
17:55 - over here on the left so where's our
18:00 - collectibles right there it is so let's
18:03 - add in duplicate this level part into
18:06 - the second part of the if and get rid of
18:10 - that
18:10 - so if level equals 2 we want to add a
18:14 - dot at -1 1 6 by 14 and then we'll have
18:21 - another collectible here we're not
18:25 - running anymore yeah M which is 1 3 7 by
18:32 - 68 okay and we'll have a collectable
18:38 - here which is minus 6 by 1 4 9
18:46 - collectable yeah -
18:49 - one to eight by two to eight and we'll
18:56 - put one here which is 109 by 303 okay
19:06 - let's give that a go
19:09 - okay what I'm going to do now is just
19:12 - add on for a level three just so when it
19:14 - gets the end of this level we will be
19:16 - able to see it progress on to the next
19:17 - level so in your platform costumes
19:21 - simply duplicate the first level it's a
19:25 - good idea let's just pop that right down
19:27 - to the bottom Oh cam how do I do that
19:30 - here we go like that and it's going to
19:33 - be there for three space one so let's
19:38 - just put some text in the top here
19:40 - saying the end question mark like that
19:45 - okay
19:46 - and in the code let's make sure that we
19:50 - have a we don't need anything so let's
19:52 - just switch the costume in the last else
19:55 - to be level three one and I think just
20:02 - check danger could be careful if we
20:04 - don't change costume will end up being
20:05 - the last costume you have which is that
20:06 - which is not a good idea so again let's
20:09 - let's create a costume three one myself
20:14 - and I'll switch to that costume at the
20:18 - end collectibles we're fine exit at the
20:25 - moment we haven't got the right level
20:28 - two checks let's add that into so that
20:32 - just means having another if in here ah
20:39 - scratched three I cannot get it there so
20:42 - yeah I cannot get it into that top it so
20:44 - I'll have to just move this side and pop
20:47 - it in like that okay that's better so
20:50 - checking the level to doing that and at
20:54 - the end so let's just set the X to be
20:57 - far away
21:00 - so set X to minus nine nine nine nine
21:06 - nine
21:06 - okay so that I'll just pop the portal
21:08 - file off the screen so that should mean
21:10 - we can get now to the let's just make
21:14 - sure we collect all of the stars go to
21:20 - the end it's completed so if we go on to
21:22 - level sorry ah almost except for we got
21:28 - a constant death loop we must have
21:30 - forgotten something in danger we're
21:32 - changing to level three one oh yeah I
21:34 - did I did not delete the danger from
21:36 - levels who you want here it is delete
21:39 - that there the end good not dying at the
21:42 - end perfect so now all we need to do is
21:47 - go back to the code in the play game
21:51 - start us off on level one by setting
21:53 - level two one and when we run it now
21:56 - back to level one and we should have a
21:58 - complete run-through of the levels that
22:01 - we just created with a nice vertical
22:05 - scrolling implemented oops
22:08 - no excellent like this into the exit and
22:17 - [Music]
22:18 - the end question mark who knows let's
22:22 - see what happens in next times tutorial
22:25 - thank you for watching see you next time
22:27 - bye now

Cleaned transcript:

hi and welcome back to part 8 of my scratch tutorial on creating a scrolling platformer now today we are going to look at vertical scrolling so this is level 2 which is in the final version of the software and you'll notice as we jump up here we're able to move up the level now that we can't do at the moment in the current version that we've worked on so far so this is what we're going to look at now so let me just close this and we'll go back to where we left off last time so where we left it last time we can scroll left and right and just quickly go off the end of this level and you'll see that we have our next level coming which is great but absolutely no movement up and down so let's first of all just tidy up the project just to get us before we start doing anything new let's get rid of this clicked max because we don't need to see that anymore so in variables we can just get rid of that by clicking the box there and also on the start this level we've still got this little bit of lava left over from when we were testing let's just tidy that up as well by going into danger and level 1 and let's just remove both those bits of lava with the Delete key like that and that's good we're now ready to get going so first of all let's make it so when we play this game what we can do at the moment you can walk left and right let's stop us from walking too far to the left so if you go into the scripts of player 1 into the TIC custom block and we scroll down to the part where we're doing the scrolling we've got the set scroll X here all we need to do is say that we don't want scroll X to be less than 0 because 0 is where we're starting here where this green starts at scroll 0 and you can simply do that by adding in an if statement after we set the scroll just there like that and compared using a less than operator and we need the variable scroll X on the left hand side and 0 on the right so we set the scroll to be the position of the player and then check to see whether it's moved less than 0 and if it has what we need to do is set it back to 0 again this is the effect of never letting score let's go less than 0 so if it sets the small X less than 0 it compares it and then we'll move it back to 0 again if it's bigger than 0 it just let it be so that allowance should mean that now we can scroll right if we go left stop scrolling see that it's not neat really easy ok so let's work on movement in the up direction to do that let's move on to level 2 because level 2 is going to be the one that lets us do the up and down movement so or to do that quickly in our when we start this again the play game a receiver set level 2 2 to start with and I when we start our game we'll be starting on level 2 see it makes life easy to test so let's put a little bit of height in this level first just so we can test it so go into the costumes of platforms and let's just add in another bit of platform we can use copy and paste on this just to quickly duplicate it like that and put it a bit higher up we'll make it smaller ok so there's something for us to jump onto hopefully we can reach that yeah let's just give that a quick go to make sure we can oh no too high let's slow it down a bit like eights try that yeah that's good ok and now let's make another one a little bit higher up again like that okay so now to the top of the screen now but we're not scrolling okay so back to the code and this is in again the player sprite in the tick just where we had the other scrolling instructions so the simplest way of doing it is simply to have another set just before the position down here set scroll Y to the Y position of the character pretty obvious really let's give it a go there we go already it Scrolls both directions but you notice that easy did you maybe you did maybe you tried it if you did good for you now that's great but upon with jumping is that it means that the screen is gonna be bouncing up and down up and down up and down all the time and that's a little bit irritating for the user and they might get a bit dizzy after playing it too long so it'd be better if we were able to not bounce the screen around quite so much and for that you need smooth scrolling and what that means is it doesn't just suddenly jump exactly to where the player is moving to the screen will scroll slightly behind the player kind of averaging out his movement now to do this we can just change the way our sets while Y works okay oh stop did game now so a little bit of information first at the moment we're setting scroll Y to Y now if we were to instead use a change scroll Y in here instead of the set okay now if we score it change it by one of course we were in the game it's gonna slowly smoothly scroll up the screen because we're changing the scroll the whole time okay but that's not what we want to do what we want to change the Y by is the amount that it will take to get us to where the player is now now to do that you need to know that the distance between the player and the current scrolling position now up to do that it's quite easy all you need is the position that you want it to scroll to which is the current player position take away the of the scroll at the moment so if we're scrolling at the moment was at the middle of the screen at zero and we were hundred higher we want to change the scroll by a hundred to get to where where the player is now so a hundred is where is now Scrolls at zero 100 taker a zero is a hundred so if we change scroll by a hundred we will actually get back to where we were meant to be so if you were not now we get exactly the same as setting scroll Y to the play position so that's no different but it sets this up to do smooth scrolling because rather than saying we want to move by the whole distance between the player and the current score position we want to say we want to move it a bit of the distance and that can be done with division or multiplication you can choose if we use division be easier to understand so we want to move by the distance between the player and the scroll but we want to do it over ten game frames so if we were now on watch it might see how the scrolling up is now slower than the player jumping so the player can jump and it's not such a harsh and jump on the user it's not licking around all over the place now one more change I would suggest we do is rather than just allowing us to be moving by this amount divided by ten the problem we have here is if we're dividing by ten on numbers are no longer than it be whole numbers not me one two three they're going to be one point two one point seven and when you're positioning scratch sprites in scratch it's better to keep them rounded to the nearest whole number so I would advise using this round and putting that around the entire change scroll like that so we're changing it by the rounded value of the distance between the player and the scroll divided by ten and that just keeps things all nice and a level it'll help with the cage detection and various things like that I'm not entirely sure how relevant that isn't scratched three it might be better to scratch Li than to button to definitely needed to do that so I suggest I would suggest doing that now anyway okay next thing then now that we can scroll up and down what about when we fall off the edge because you don't want to really see yourself die like that because you no longer touching the bottom so what we can do here is stop the player at this level from scrolling down any further down the starting position just like we did for moving too far left so again in the tick custom block just before we do the position added another if just like this one like this and this time we'll check scroll Y being less than 0 and if it is set scroll Y to 0 yeah that say if I will just try that again that should mean now if I fall off it doesn't scroll down but it does scroll up and that's really nice now smooth scrolling you could of course do the same smooth scrolling on the left and right as well at the moment it perfectly Scrolls after my character but you could if you wanted instead of having this set small X to X you could do a change for all X by round of X takeaways for all X divided by 10 or by another number the bigger this number the longer it takes the screen to catch up the smallest number the more it will be just stick stuck to the player sounds up to you in this particular game I quite like it being stuck in the middle so I'm going to leave it like that but you can choose to try that out if you like so what does that leave for this tutorial not much really all that I really want to do is actually build upon this level and make it a bigger level so why not have some fun changing the costumes and adding some more to this level so let's have a look that's in the platforms in the costumes let's just stop this now let's change this level a little bit so we've already started to build up this little jumping thing slow why not let's just stay with that shall we but let's add in a next part that's duplicate this sprite and we're gonna build up above this level here so to do that we're going to have to pretend that we're down here and we're jumping up from below so we've just got to this one here which was gonna be around here ish so let's make him jump maybe to the left to a platform down here like this and then back maybe a bit further jump to here okay let's just give that a go so let's see what we need to do is this is level 2 2 which is great then I'm doing this all nicely in line with how we wanted to do it so in the platform scripts we moved down to where we're starting level 2 in the setup what we need is there one of these clone blocks to create the second part of the level above the last one so for that to work we have to position it at 0 which means we're not moving across and then this one here is for moving up so let's move it up by I'm not quite sure what to do at the moment so let's just choose a number like 200 and just see what happens ok let's run that ok it was not anywhere near enough so it's actually still quite low down so let's move it up let's try 400 run that ok better bit too high now so let's move it down a little bit more let's try 350 ok that's more like it and look with this jump here we can actually afford to make it quite a bit further we can jump quite far there so let's just tweak that level and move it further across like that let's add a little bit more level on them says duplicate to this costume so now let's make a bit to the right of this that's of a circle to jump on to okay and I'll just oops I'll just delete these this levels really very white isn't it we can do so about that later on just copy and paste these circles naturally what I really want is some danger on these levels so things that can kill you let's add in hey yeah big nasty red lava like so inside these ones and I'm gonna multi select these heading shift and fill them in white as well and then move them to the front okay so let's position this on our game now so we're going to put it here to the right of the other sprites 11 this level so go into the code I'll duplicate that and I want it to be to the right of this so I'll move it along by I'll do 360 just to see how that works I don't want it to be any higher so let's just run now to see what happens okay it's not bad I'd actually prefer to more to the right so let's just tweak that and add in 152 I say oh yes good now the moment course we will not die on the red because we changed our scripts so that our red parts have to be in danger so let's just fix that so if we go into the costumes first of all what have we got in danger let's just check level 2 1 so we've got that bit we need this bit and we need this new bit as well so to go into there so we've got the same sprites but we can clear this because we don't want this bit of level to be dangerous delete that and in this sprite we want to remove the white parts leaving the danger okay and then go back into your platforms and remove the red bit okay and now once we've deleted that go into your code and we need to duplicate the level cloning from level 2 into the danger too so just drag that part of the cloning into the danger and this needs to move in to level 2 to exactly the same positions so now when we play the game we should find that the danger is there again and now we can die in it great now I'm noticing that we are starting up here that's curious isn't it sped again now why is that are we not setting our scroll X at the beginning of the game let's call Y sorry let's see where's the race set so we're setting we really aren't that's bad ok we need to fix that we need to set our scroll X and scroll Y the beginning here in game on otherwise the game will not start at night position so set scroll X and setscore y20 just here now when we die it repositions it's at the stars level so the only thing left to do is to put the exit this exit here at the end oh not the only thing what one thing to do we've also got to do the collectables they've got to get the exit to be here at the end of the game so how do we do that you remember you put your mouse where you want it to be while the game is running and you press M it gives us the position that we need to set it to click in to exit and in the level 2 part which is this one we need to enter in that number so 7 4 4 by 1 4 7 8 4 7 8 ok hide the mouse just check that that positioned correctly yep there it is and so one more thing to do is adding some more nice collectables to get while you were playing the game so let's just start the level again and we're putting some collectibles so let's put one in over here on the left so where's our collectibles right there it is so let's add in duplicate this level part into the second part of the if and get rid of that so if level equals 2 we want to add a dot at 1 1 6 by 14 and then we'll have another collectible here we're not running anymore yeah M which is 1 3 7 by 68 okay and we'll have a collectable here which is minus 6 by 1 4 9 collectable yeah one to eight by two to eight and we'll put one here which is 109 by 303 okay let's give that a go okay what I'm going to do now is just add on for a level three just so when it gets the end of this level we will be able to see it progress on to the next level so in your platform costumes simply duplicate the first level it's a good idea let's just pop that right down to the bottom Oh cam how do I do that here we go like that and it's going to be there for three space one so let's just put some text in the top here saying the end question mark like that okay and in the code let's make sure that we have a we don't need anything so let's just switch the costume in the last else to be level three one and I think just check danger could be careful if we don't change costume will end up being the last costume you have which is that which is not a good idea so again let's let's create a costume three one myself and I'll switch to that costume at the end collectibles we're fine exit at the moment we haven't got the right level two checks let's add that into so that just means having another if in here ah scratched three I cannot get it there so yeah I cannot get it into that top it so I'll have to just move this side and pop it in like that okay that's better so checking the level to doing that and at the end so let's just set the X to be far away so set X to minus nine nine nine nine nine okay so that I'll just pop the portal file off the screen so that should mean we can get now to the let's just make sure we collect all of the stars go to the end it's completed so if we go on to level sorry ah almost except for we got a constant death loop we must have forgotten something in danger we're changing to level three one oh yeah I did I did not delete the danger from levels who you want here it is delete that there the end good not dying at the end perfect so now all we need to do is go back to the code in the play game start us off on level one by setting level two one and when we run it now back to level one and we should have a complete runthrough of the levels that we just created with a nice vertical scrolling implemented oops no excellent like this into the exit and the end question mark who knows let's see what happens in next times tutorial thank you for watching see you next time bye now
