00:02 - hello fellow scratchers do your games
00:05 - need a little more snazzing up well i'm
00:07 - griff batch and today we are looking at
00:09 - some neat graphical effects that can
00:12 - really take your games to the next level
00:14 - by combining scratches effect blocks and
00:16 - the pen extension we can transform a
00:18 - flat boring screen lifting the
00:21 - foreground away from the background with
00:23 - a stylish outline of shadow wow what a
00:26 - difference and this works on any costume
00:29 - vector or bitmap and even looks good on
00:31 - text yeah it just makes things pop
00:35 - now we could recreate this effect by
00:36 - hand in the paint editor but doing so is
00:39 - quite time consuming and fiddly what's
00:42 - more if you want to change your level at
00:43 - a later date then you have to redo all
00:46 - your hard work all over again so in this
00:49 - tutorial i'm going to show you how we
00:52 - can replicate this effect using only
00:54 - simple costumes and a bit of funky
00:56 - scratch code so what are we waiting for
00:59 - let's get scratching
01:01 - we'll begin a new project and since
01:03 - scratchy is waiting here on the stage to
01:06 - greet us
01:06 - let's focus some attention on him first
01:09 - make him nice and big by setting his
01:11 - size to 250.
01:13 - many of you will already have played
01:15 - with the effects blocks found under the
01:17 - looks category but for those who haven't
01:19 - we will begin with the set color effect
01:22 - 2 block make sure to use the set block
01:24 - not the change block for this
01:26 - now change the drop down to read
01:29 - brightness
01:30 - so this starts on a brightness of zero
01:32 - but if you click this you'll find that
01:34 - this has no effect on scratch cat at all
01:37 - that's because a brightness of zero
01:38 - means no change so we can try 50. click
01:42 - the block and scratch cat becomes 50
01:44 - brighter
01:45 - so things get interesting when we whap
01:47 - this right up to 100 that's full
01:50 - brightness again click the block
01:53 - and lo scratchcat appears to have
01:56 - disappeared however this is not quite
01:58 - the case they have actually become pure
02:01 - white that's really useful if you ever
02:04 - want to flash the sprite white for any
02:06 - reason but equally interesting therefore
02:08 - is if we go the other way a brightness
02:11 - of negative 50 makes our cat 50 darker
02:14 - than normal and negative 100 gives us a
02:17 - completely black silhouette of scratch
02:19 - cat now that's really useful
02:22 - another useful effect i like to use a
02:24 - lot is the ghost effect
02:26 - i'll set this to 90
02:28 - and when combined with the brightness
02:30 - effect then scratch cat becomes an
02:32 - almost completely see-through silhouette
02:34 - perfect for recreating a drop shadow
02:37 - effect
02:38 - all we need to do is bring back the
02:40 - original cat costume and overlay it on
02:42 - top
02:44 - well to get back the original costume we
02:46 - simply use the clear graphic effect
02:48 - block
02:49 - one click and it's back to normal
02:51 - but also gone is our shadow
02:55 - okay so we need both visible at once so
02:58 - what options do we have
03:00 - either we could create a clone of this
03:02 - sprite
03:03 - or we could as we are about to do
03:06 - use costume stamping
03:08 - for this we need to enable a scratch
03:11 - extension click into the extensions box
03:13 - at the bottom left of the scratch window
03:16 - now select the pen extension
03:20 - nice now we have a whole new category of
03:22 - scratch blocks to play with but for this
03:24 - tutorial we are mainly interested in the
03:26 - stamp block here
03:29 - if we click the stamp block and then
03:31 - drag scratch cat you can see it has
03:33 - happily left a copy of itself behind on
03:35 - the stage
03:36 - this we can repeat as many times as we
03:38 - like and it's important to note that
03:40 - these are not clones and the stamped
03:42 - copies are not draggable or movable in
03:45 - the slightest at least not without
03:47 - clearing and then restamping them
03:50 - if we go full screen you'll also see
03:52 - that the stamped costumes unlike clones
03:54 - are not quite as high resolution the
03:57 - edges are pixley that is they're made up
03:59 - of small jagged squares
04:01 - sadly there's nothing we can do about
04:03 - this at present it's just how the pen
04:05 - drawing and stamping canvas works
04:08 - anyhow it still does a good enough job
04:10 - so bring in the last new block we will
04:12 - be looking at the arrays all block
04:15 - clicking this block does what it says
04:17 - and it erases everything that has been
04:19 - drawn or stamped on the pen canvas
04:23 - okay let's try and make a shadow from
04:26 - this
04:27 - position the cat where the shadow wants
04:28 - to be
04:29 - apply the brightness effect
04:32 - apply the ghost effect and then we stamp
04:35 - the costume just as it is
04:37 - nice so we can now move the sprite up
04:40 - oh there's the stamped shadow we just
04:42 - need to clear the graphical effects to
04:44 - bring back our official sprite
04:46 - and there they are
04:48 - and pop them where we want them to
04:50 - finish up
04:51 - yeah there we have a very respectable
04:54 - stamped shadow
04:57 - so having done it by hand let's make it
05:00 - official and turn this into a script
05:03 - when green flag clicked erase all
05:06 - now i'm going to use a custom block to
05:08 - represent the next steps
05:13 - name it stamp
05:14 - shadow
05:21 - we might as well make use of it right
05:23 - away under the arrays all block
05:27 - so we set the brightness to negative 100
05:31 - and set the ghost to 90. next up we need
05:34 - to think about how to position the
05:35 - shadow we want it to be below the
05:38 - current sprite so why not use a change y
05:41 - by say
05:42 - negative 20.
05:44 - that will move us downwards
05:46 - then we're free to stamp the shadow on
05:48 - the pen canvas
05:50 - to get us back to where we were before
05:52 - we can simply change y by 20 again the
05:55 - opposite of the negative 20 we did above
05:58 - lastly clear the graphics effects to
06:00 - finish off
06:02 - and that's it so we can test this now by
06:04 - first moving the cat sprite and then
06:07 - clicking the green flag
06:08 - hey the shadow followed us success and
06:12 - very useful indeed
06:15 - one thing that is not obvious thus far
06:17 - is how cool the shadow can look on a
06:19 - more funky background for this we'll
06:21 - need to click into the stage backdrop
06:23 - and bring up the backdrops editor
06:26 - i'll start by creating a filled
06:28 - rectangle to cover the entire stage
06:32 - hmm perhaps a little less intense blue
06:35 - and then in a slightly lighter shade of
06:36 - blue make some long rectangles perhaps
06:40 - rotate them a tad and then duplicate
06:42 - them in a pattern across the screen
06:45 - with a select tool you can hold the alt
06:47 - key down while dragging to make copies
06:48 - quickly or you can just use the copy and
06:51 - paste if you prefer
06:53 - great so look at this how cool does that
06:55 - look now and see how the shadow really
06:58 - does have that see-through effect
07:00 - that's what really makes this lift off
07:02 - the page so to speak
07:04 - okay click back into the main sprite now
07:06 - and i just want to add that the ghost
07:08 - number of 90 here you can change that to
07:11 - anything between 0 and 100 and the
07:14 - result is the shadow will be heavier or
07:16 - lighter see how much darker 80 is
07:19 - yeah for shadow i will keep this on 90.
07:24 - now i think you will agree that looks
07:26 - great for a sprite like scratch cat but
07:29 - next up i want to show you how cool it
07:31 - can look to enhance your scratch games
07:33 - by giving depth to your level designs
07:36 - we can click into the costume editor and
07:38 - start drawing a new costume
07:40 - this is to be the level of a game so i'm
07:42 - using filled rectangles to create clean
07:45 - solid areas for the ceiling walls and
07:47 - floor
07:52 - now i'm not seeing the entire costume on
07:54 - the stage because i left the size on 250
07:57 - from earlier
07:58 - we'd better reset that to 100 and
08:00 - position it at an x y of zero
08:03 - okay so i'll also add a small floating
08:06 - platform here for effect
08:08 - nice this is done and it was so quick to
08:11 - put together but man without texture or
08:14 - outlines it looks really flat on the
08:16 - stage doesn't it
08:18 - although it's fun that scratch cat's
08:20 - shadow is still here
08:22 - okay so click the green flag and voila
08:26 - the level is transformed by the addition
08:28 - of our drop shadow you can see it around
08:30 - the ceiling and the floating platform
08:32 - that is cool
08:34 - but it's still not quite as good as it
08:37 - could be we really would benefit from
08:39 - giving the edge of the level a nice
08:41 - crisp outline to separate it from the
08:43 - background so
08:45 - easy right we just select all the level
08:47 - shapes in the costume editor and give
08:49 - them an outline
08:50 - well yes and no there's this small
08:53 - problem that each shape receives its own
08:56 - distinct outline
08:58 - what we want is the whole level to be
08:59 - treated as a single object and surround
09:02 - that with the black outline
09:05 - sadly this is not quite so easy we could
09:08 - spend lots of time hand crafting the
09:10 - levels from one object using the shaping
09:12 - tool that is often my preferred method
09:14 - or we could use the trick i used in
09:16 - apple and duplicate all the costumes one
09:18 - with a border and one without only
09:20 - showing the bordered ones on a layer
09:22 - behind the non-bordered ones
09:25 - but today we are experimenting with pen
09:28 - solutions so i'll remove the object's
09:30 - outlines and let's see what we can do
09:32 - with scripts
09:35 - click into the main sprite code and
09:37 - let's duplicate the script from our
09:38 - stamp shadow custom block
09:41 - and what i want us to do is to remove
09:43 - the ghost effect completely without the
09:45 - ghosting effect this script now has the
09:48 - effect of drawing a fully black shadow
09:51 - yep there you go so why is this useful
09:55 - well let us continue and it'll become
09:57 - clearer click the green flag to reset
10:00 - and then let me reduce how far the
10:02 - second script moves the sprite it's
10:04 - currently at -20 so bring it right back
10:07 - to just negative three
10:10 - and then of course the positive three to
10:12 - balance it out
10:15 - so if we click the script again ah now
10:18 - then do you see what we are doing we've
10:20 - created a black outline underneath the
10:24 - entire level
10:25 - of course it only hugs the underside of
10:27 - the level at present but perhaps we can
10:29 - do more about that
10:31 - without resetting the project change the
10:33 - first change y to be a positive three
10:35 - and the second to be negative three
10:37 - this way the sprite will be moved up
10:39 - first instead of down if i run the
10:41 - script and then the result is rather
10:44 - cool the top of the level is now been
10:46 - sandwiched by another black line
10:48 - now this is really promising and you
10:50 - should be getting the big picture if we
10:52 - do this in all directions then we'll end
10:55 - up with a perfect black outline around
10:58 - all the edges not just the top and
11:00 - bottom
11:01 - to make this process easier we'll rework
11:03 - the scripts to loop around in a circle
11:06 - stamping each edge as it goes
11:08 - but if we are to be rotating the sprite
11:11 - inner circle we'd best set the rotation
11:13 - mode first to don't rotate otherwise our
11:16 - costume will point in all sorts of
11:18 - directions and the stamping won't look
11:20 - right at all
11:22 - next we set the brightness so all the
11:24 - edges will be the same
11:26 - and here we go wrap the rest of the
11:28 - blocks in our repeat loop
11:30 - i'm going to pick the number eight as
11:32 - that will cover both the basic four
11:34 - directions up right down and left
11:37 - plus the additional diagonals in between
11:40 - two
11:41 - now we should move the clear graphics
11:43 - effects to outside the repeat loop so it
11:45 - doesn't reset until aft drawing is
11:47 - finished
11:49 - so what next
11:51 - well previously we used the change y to
11:54 - move the sprite but since we want to
11:56 - move in different directions i'm going
11:58 - to switch this for a move in steps block
12:02 - and we move forward by the same three
12:04 - steps as before
12:06 - let's switch both these change y's for
12:08 - move-in steps the last one of course
12:11 - moving by negative three
12:14 - right all we need to do now is rotate
12:16 - our directions ready to stamp the next
12:19 - edge we turn right that is clockwise by
12:22 - 45 degrees since 8 45 adds up to 360 a
12:27 - full circle
12:28 - and that is it but to let us see this in
12:31 - action i'm going to temporarily add a
12:34 - weight one second at the bottom of the
12:35 - loop
12:37 - click the green flag to reset the
12:39 - project and then click our new script
12:43 - oh black
12:44 - oh it's okay that got me for a moment
12:47 - yes so did you see the black silhouette
12:49 - moving around before it finished and
12:51 - showed us the original costume in the
12:52 - center
12:53 - let me play that again for you
12:56 - do watch to see it moving around in a
12:57 - circle did you see it
13:00 - well the finished result is great a
13:02 - perfect outline indeed and what a
13:05 - difference it makes to the scene there's
13:07 - no need for this to be slowed down
13:08 - though so remove the weight and let's
13:10 - see it again green flag and click the
13:13 - script
13:14 - that was faster but still not fast
13:17 - enough we really don't want to see this
13:18 - flicker black at all
13:20 - luckily we can fix that we just need our
13:22 - friend run without screen refresh for
13:25 - that we must make a new custom block
13:28 - name it stamp outline and yes tick the
13:32 - run without screen refresh this will
13:34 - allow our repeat loop to run without
13:36 - treating it as an animation it will just
13:38 - draw instantly
13:40 - attach it to our outlining script and
13:43 - then we'll complete the project by
13:45 - dropping the outline block to just
13:47 - before we then draw the shadow
13:50 - so does this make it all run super fast
13:53 - to make testing easier i'm going to add
13:55 - a key press to erase all
13:58 - now i can go full screen click the space
14:00 - to erase all our effects
14:03 - oh wow doesn't the level look flat again
14:05 - you forget
14:07 - and now click the green flag
14:09 - and pow the whole level pops out at you
14:13 - i'm so pleased with that and yes it
14:15 - draws really really quickly no problems
14:18 - there then
14:19 - so how about we try this with something
14:21 - completely different
14:23 - i'll just make a new costume
14:25 - oh wow even this black level with a
14:28 - shadow gives me all sorts of ideas for a
14:30 - cool looking game
14:31 - anyhow drawing something more organic
14:34 - less rectangular
14:37 - and run that
14:39 - okay yeah it doesn't look so great with
14:41 - this bright background hold on while i
14:43 - draw something else
14:46 - okay
14:47 - ah
14:48 - better
14:49 - but perhaps a little too bright in the
14:51 - foreground now
14:54 - there
14:55 - well i don't know but it's still pretty
14:57 - cool and might give you all sorts of
14:58 - ideas right
15:00 - and it works on all sorts of things text
15:04 - levels
15:05 - shapes
15:07 - and of course scratch cat
15:09 - but all this is leading towards the next
15:12 - episode of our classic scratch
15:13 - platformer where i will be using this
15:15 - technique to upgrade the visuals before
15:17 - adding in collectibles keys and working
15:20 - doors so excited for that if you want to
15:23 - try this code out in your platformer
15:25 - then just backpack the scripts and drop
15:27 - them into the level sprite you can
15:29 - trigger them off the change a scene
15:31 - event rather than the green flag simple
15:34 - as that
15:35 - well i hope you've enjoyed this episode
15:38 - i've created a studio on scratch for you
15:40 - to share your creations in and i'm dead
15:42 - excited to see what you come up with
15:44 - just be as creative as you can and have
15:46 - fun it could be a cool scene or a game
15:49 - doesn't matter and i can't wait to see
15:51 - them if you like this video then please
15:53 - do smash the like button and if you want
15:55 - to see more then subscribe to the
15:57 - channel and you won't miss out on the
15:58 - next exciting tutorial
16:00 - until next time have a great week ahead
16:03 - and scratch on guys
16:07 - [Music]
16:12 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers do your games need a little more snazzing up well i'm griff batch and today we are looking at some neat graphical effects that can really take your games to the next level by combining scratches effect blocks and the pen extension we can transform a flat boring screen lifting the foreground away from the background with a stylish outline of shadow wow what a difference and this works on any costume vector or bitmap and even looks good on text yeah it just makes things pop now we could recreate this effect by hand in the paint editor but doing so is quite time consuming and fiddly what's more if you want to change your level at a later date then you have to redo all your hard work all over again so in this tutorial i'm going to show you how we can replicate this effect using only simple costumes and a bit of funky scratch code so what are we waiting for let's get scratching we'll begin a new project and since scratchy is waiting here on the stage to greet us let's focus some attention on him first make him nice and big by setting his size to 250. many of you will already have played with the effects blocks found under the looks category but for those who haven't we will begin with the set color effect 2 block make sure to use the set block not the change block for this now change the drop down to read brightness so this starts on a brightness of zero but if you click this you'll find that this has no effect on scratch cat at all that's because a brightness of zero means no change so we can try 50. click the block and scratch cat becomes 50 brighter so things get interesting when we whap this right up to 100 that's full brightness again click the block and lo scratchcat appears to have disappeared however this is not quite the case they have actually become pure white that's really useful if you ever want to flash the sprite white for any reason but equally interesting therefore is if we go the other way a brightness of negative 50 makes our cat 50 darker than normal and negative 100 gives us a completely black silhouette of scratch cat now that's really useful another useful effect i like to use a lot is the ghost effect i'll set this to 90 and when combined with the brightness effect then scratch cat becomes an almost completely seethrough silhouette perfect for recreating a drop shadow effect all we need to do is bring back the original cat costume and overlay it on top well to get back the original costume we simply use the clear graphic effect block one click and it's back to normal but also gone is our shadow okay so we need both visible at once so what options do we have either we could create a clone of this sprite or we could as we are about to do use costume stamping for this we need to enable a scratch extension click into the extensions box at the bottom left of the scratch window now select the pen extension nice now we have a whole new category of scratch blocks to play with but for this tutorial we are mainly interested in the stamp block here if we click the stamp block and then drag scratch cat you can see it has happily left a copy of itself behind on the stage this we can repeat as many times as we like and it's important to note that these are not clones and the stamped copies are not draggable or movable in the slightest at least not without clearing and then restamping them if we go full screen you'll also see that the stamped costumes unlike clones are not quite as high resolution the edges are pixley that is they're made up of small jagged squares sadly there's nothing we can do about this at present it's just how the pen drawing and stamping canvas works anyhow it still does a good enough job so bring in the last new block we will be looking at the arrays all block clicking this block does what it says and it erases everything that has been drawn or stamped on the pen canvas okay let's try and make a shadow from this position the cat where the shadow wants to be apply the brightness effect apply the ghost effect and then we stamp the costume just as it is nice so we can now move the sprite up oh there's the stamped shadow we just need to clear the graphical effects to bring back our official sprite and there they are and pop them where we want them to finish up yeah there we have a very respectable stamped shadow so having done it by hand let's make it official and turn this into a script when green flag clicked erase all now i'm going to use a custom block to represent the next steps name it stamp shadow we might as well make use of it right away under the arrays all block so we set the brightness to negative 100 and set the ghost to 90. next up we need to think about how to position the shadow we want it to be below the current sprite so why not use a change y by say negative 20. that will move us downwards then we're free to stamp the shadow on the pen canvas to get us back to where we were before we can simply change y by 20 again the opposite of the negative 20 we did above lastly clear the graphics effects to finish off and that's it so we can test this now by first moving the cat sprite and then clicking the green flag hey the shadow followed us success and very useful indeed one thing that is not obvious thus far is how cool the shadow can look on a more funky background for this we'll need to click into the stage backdrop and bring up the backdrops editor i'll start by creating a filled rectangle to cover the entire stage hmm perhaps a little less intense blue and then in a slightly lighter shade of blue make some long rectangles perhaps rotate them a tad and then duplicate them in a pattern across the screen with a select tool you can hold the alt key down while dragging to make copies quickly or you can just use the copy and paste if you prefer great so look at this how cool does that look now and see how the shadow really does have that seethrough effect that's what really makes this lift off the page so to speak okay click back into the main sprite now and i just want to add that the ghost number of 90 here you can change that to anything between 0 and 100 and the result is the shadow will be heavier or lighter see how much darker 80 is yeah for shadow i will keep this on 90. now i think you will agree that looks great for a sprite like scratch cat but next up i want to show you how cool it can look to enhance your scratch games by giving depth to your level designs we can click into the costume editor and start drawing a new costume this is to be the level of a game so i'm using filled rectangles to create clean solid areas for the ceiling walls and floor now i'm not seeing the entire costume on the stage because i left the size on 250 from earlier we'd better reset that to 100 and position it at an x y of zero okay so i'll also add a small floating platform here for effect nice this is done and it was so quick to put together but man without texture or outlines it looks really flat on the stage doesn't it although it's fun that scratch cat's shadow is still here okay so click the green flag and voila the level is transformed by the addition of our drop shadow you can see it around the ceiling and the floating platform that is cool but it's still not quite as good as it could be we really would benefit from giving the edge of the level a nice crisp outline to separate it from the background so easy right we just select all the level shapes in the costume editor and give them an outline well yes and no there's this small problem that each shape receives its own distinct outline what we want is the whole level to be treated as a single object and surround that with the black outline sadly this is not quite so easy we could spend lots of time hand crafting the levels from one object using the shaping tool that is often my preferred method or we could use the trick i used in apple and duplicate all the costumes one with a border and one without only showing the bordered ones on a layer behind the nonbordered ones but today we are experimenting with pen solutions so i'll remove the object's outlines and let's see what we can do with scripts click into the main sprite code and let's duplicate the script from our stamp shadow custom block and what i want us to do is to remove the ghost effect completely without the ghosting effect this script now has the effect of drawing a fully black shadow yep there you go so why is this useful well let us continue and it'll become clearer click the green flag to reset and then let me reduce how far the second script moves the sprite it's currently at 20 so bring it right back to just negative three and then of course the positive three to balance it out so if we click the script again ah now then do you see what we are doing we've created a black outline underneath the entire level of course it only hugs the underside of the level at present but perhaps we can do more about that without resetting the project change the first change y to be a positive three and the second to be negative three this way the sprite will be moved up first instead of down if i run the script and then the result is rather cool the top of the level is now been sandwiched by another black line now this is really promising and you should be getting the big picture if we do this in all directions then we'll end up with a perfect black outline around all the edges not just the top and bottom to make this process easier we'll rework the scripts to loop around in a circle stamping each edge as it goes but if we are to be rotating the sprite inner circle we'd best set the rotation mode first to don't rotate otherwise our costume will point in all sorts of directions and the stamping won't look right at all next we set the brightness so all the edges will be the same and here we go wrap the rest of the blocks in our repeat loop i'm going to pick the number eight as that will cover both the basic four directions up right down and left plus the additional diagonals in between two now we should move the clear graphics effects to outside the repeat loop so it doesn't reset until aft drawing is finished so what next well previously we used the change y to move the sprite but since we want to move in different directions i'm going to switch this for a move in steps block and we move forward by the same three steps as before let's switch both these change y's for movein steps the last one of course moving by negative three right all we need to do now is rotate our directions ready to stamp the next edge we turn right that is clockwise by 45 degrees since 8 45 adds up to 360 a full circle and that is it but to let us see this in action i'm going to temporarily add a weight one second at the bottom of the loop click the green flag to reset the project and then click our new script oh black oh it's okay that got me for a moment yes so did you see the black silhouette moving around before it finished and showed us the original costume in the center let me play that again for you do watch to see it moving around in a circle did you see it well the finished result is great a perfect outline indeed and what a difference it makes to the scene there's no need for this to be slowed down though so remove the weight and let's see it again green flag and click the script that was faster but still not fast enough we really don't want to see this flicker black at all luckily we can fix that we just need our friend run without screen refresh for that we must make a new custom block name it stamp outline and yes tick the run without screen refresh this will allow our repeat loop to run without treating it as an animation it will just draw instantly attach it to our outlining script and then we'll complete the project by dropping the outline block to just before we then draw the shadow so does this make it all run super fast to make testing easier i'm going to add a key press to erase all now i can go full screen click the space to erase all our effects oh wow doesn't the level look flat again you forget and now click the green flag and pow the whole level pops out at you i'm so pleased with that and yes it draws really really quickly no problems there then so how about we try this with something completely different i'll just make a new costume oh wow even this black level with a shadow gives me all sorts of ideas for a cool looking game anyhow drawing something more organic less rectangular and run that okay yeah it doesn't look so great with this bright background hold on while i draw something else okay ah better but perhaps a little too bright in the foreground now there well i don't know but it's still pretty cool and might give you all sorts of ideas right and it works on all sorts of things text levels shapes and of course scratch cat but all this is leading towards the next episode of our classic scratch platformer where i will be using this technique to upgrade the visuals before adding in collectibles keys and working doors so excited for that if you want to try this code out in your platformer then just backpack the scripts and drop them into the level sprite you can trigger them off the change a scene event rather than the green flag simple as that well i hope you've enjoyed this episode i've created a studio on scratch for you to share your creations in and i'm dead excited to see what you come up with just be as creative as you can and have fun it could be a cool scene or a game doesn't matter and i can't wait to see them if you like this video then please do smash the like button and if you want to see more then subscribe to the channel and you won't miss out on the next exciting tutorial until next time have a great week ahead and scratch on guys you
