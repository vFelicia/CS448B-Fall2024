00:00 - hi sis Grif patch welcome to part 5 of
00:02 - my top-down scrolling tutorial for
00:04 - scratch in this episode we're going up
00:07 - the project had in a ending screen and
00:11 - the timer and really just wrap up the
00:13 - game so I hope you will enjoy this let's
00:15 - get on with it what we need now is a way
00:18 - of winning the level now in was Amba
00:22 - cube why did for that is just add a
00:24 - colorful exit so let's go into costumes
00:26 - and we'll add in a new color for the
00:30 - exit now the exit can be a light blue
00:35 - color
00:36 - like this so let me just add in an exit
00:40 - over here so that's our exit now when I
00:46 - get and touch that I want it to finish
00:48 - the game so I just come over here a
00:50 - second there we go
00:52 - as soon as I walk onto that product
00:54 - finish I don't want to finish my touch
00:55 - it I want I it to be completely on top
00:58 - of it to finish the game and we can do
01:01 - that I go into the player later okay so
01:06 - we've got the touching enemy there I can
01:09 - borrow that and also have it for
01:12 - touching the exit so if I have another
01:15 - touching at the bottom here so touching
01:17 - no not zombie touching color
01:22 - so if I am touching this blue color like
01:26 - this then I'm going to set the game to
01:30 - win now that at the moment would end as
01:32 - soon as I touch it not close I'm sitting
01:34 - on top of it so I need another special
01:36 - little trick here so I need another if
01:40 - statement inside and I'm gonna say I'm
01:44 - not touching
01:47 - and I'm going to choose the background
01:50 - color so if I'm touching the blue exit
01:54 - and I'm not touching the black so any
01:58 - way that can happen is if I'm actually
01:59 - right on top of it because I'm touching
02:00 - a black otherwise you see an end is set
02:03 - to win at the moment that will be the
02:06 - same as dying because there is no
02:08 - difference between winning and dying
02:11 - I'll just restart the game but watch
02:13 - this
02:13 - so I'm now overlapping it and as soon as
02:16 - I go over it restarts so it is working I
02:20 - just need to actually have an exit so at
02:22 - the moment down here in the main game
02:24 - loop at the end if ended die I shape the
02:27 - screen otherwise it's going to be
02:29 - winning and so what we need here is the
02:31 - wind screen so what I shall do in there
02:35 - is create a new custom block called win
02:40 - and again don't run without screen
02:42 - refresh leave that unchecked so here it
02:46 - is but win in there
02:51 - the position that booty again and then
02:54 - whatever I want to do when I win has to
02:56 - happen here so what are we going to do
03:01 - when we win but be the best thing to do
03:03 - would be to put a well done you have one
03:06 - message on the screen
03:10 - so let's add in a U of one message so
03:13 - when it does this win let's do a
03:15 - broadcast
03:18 - and wait
03:22 - it's gonna be a new message maybe you
03:24 - won so and let's create a new sprite
03:30 - paint and we're gonna call this
03:37 - for now and I'm going to call the
03:39 - costume win as well and I'm going to
03:42 - write some text on the screen what color
03:45 - we're going to do it in let's do it in
03:50 - okay look let's do it in black to start
03:53 - with and we're going to use the pixel
03:55 - font you win like that
04:06 - okay now this is quite a nice little
04:09 - trick watch this if I grab the corner
04:11 - make it bigger
04:15 - of that of course does not show up on
04:16 - the screen nicely but watch this if I
04:19 - copy it and paste it you can use these
04:22 - buttons do that if you want to always
04:24 - positions if you zoomed out five pixels
04:27 - to the right five down so if I use the
04:29 - arrow keys I can press it five times up
04:30 - one two three four five and the left
04:32 - five one two three four five then that
04:34 - exactly over the top of each other then
04:37 - change the outline to be white you can
04:42 - start see that appearing and bump up the
04:46 - width to be maybe four five maybe five
04:50 - and then click back now I've got an
04:56 - outline around my font book
04:59 - which is quite funky you can choose the
05:02 - width the outline using this
05:05 - so I can make it really big and that
05:09 - what's really well with the pixel font
05:11 - very perfect
05:14 - thing like that's one thing you don't
05:15 - have to like that any kind of wind thing
05:17 - you like and I can group that together
05:18 - so there's a you win sign and I can move
05:21 - that to somewhere on the screen where I
05:22 - want it
05:23 - let me slightly up at the buff like that
05:27 - okay code so when I receive
05:34 - and this is going to be set up to hide
05:39 - this
05:40 - message that and when I receive my win
05:49 - you won I want to show my message so
05:55 - what I'm going to do in here is I'm
05:58 - going to just pause the game and that'll
06:00 - be the end of the game until you press
06:02 - the green flag again so I'm gonna have a
06:04 - control then gonna have a forever and
06:08 - then I mean I just put a weight in there
06:11 - like that so it's gonna loop forever one
06:13 - more thing of course I need to put a
06:15 - go-to X Y and I'm gonna have zero zero
06:18 - so it appears in the middle so let's
06:20 - just see if this works okay here I go
06:25 - I need to make it
06:27 - onto the exit and I won perfect
06:34 - and if I die
06:36 - I died so you might want a bit of text
06:40 - on screen here saying press any key to
06:42 - start let's do that as well
06:44 - already we use this wind sprite so if I
06:47 - do play that I can right click in here
06:50 - so that's right to press any key to
06:58 - start okay
07:04 - so shrink that down so it fits on the
07:07 - screen
07:14 - like that and I'm going to create the
07:18 - little bit of background so copy paste
07:20 - you've up by 5 1 2 3 4 5 left by 500 3 4
07:24 - 5 give it a walk now order white make it
07:31 - slightly thicker and to back I'll make
07:35 - it for 5 thick okay so hopefully
07:40 - actually might need to be thicker than
07:42 - that let's have a look
07:44 - so in the code that's over when I
07:47 - receive
07:49 - in fact let's do it in the setup so
07:52 - we've already got it so so rather than
07:53 - hiding let's get rid of that what we
07:56 - actually want to do is duplicate the
07:59 - code from the win go to 0-0 show no
08:03 - forever loop I want it here instead is a
08:07 - set costume - Oh didn't name it win -
08:12 - that's no use let's call it ready okay
08:18 - switch to the ready costume and show it
08:20 - so that means at the very beginning it
08:24 - has the press any key to start
08:27 - move that down a little bit it's too
08:29 - high
08:30 - what I realize now having just written
08:33 - that it's actually that's probably a
08:34 - better way of doing this what I'm going
08:36 - to do not call this a setup I'm going to
08:38 - have a new message and I'm gonna call
08:40 - this ready like that okay so this is
08:44 - will be broadcast when it's time to
08:46 - start a game it'll set the costume and
08:48 - I'm going to put the weight for any key
08:51 - press in here so let's put in the wait
08:54 - until and sensing and we're going to put
08:58 - in here the key pressed any key and when
09:04 - we press any key we're going to hide
09:06 - this message okay so then go into player
09:11 - where we've got the any key here and
09:14 - instead of doing that
09:16 - let's do a broadcast and wait
09:20 - so
09:21 - broadcast ready at and then we can get
09:26 - rid of that wait any key because the
09:28 - ready is and they do it for us since if
09:32 - ago so there's the press any key and
09:34 - then not winning on it putting the key
09:37 - it disappears and we're off I
09:41 - as the key we off died
09:45 - okay only one thing left to do and that
09:48 - is have a timer to see how long it took
09:51 - us to complete that level so let's have
09:53 - a go at that simplest way of doing that
09:57 - is that in sensing we have a timer here
09:59 - so let's call the reset timer just
10:03 - before we start our repeat until loop
10:06 - our game so every time it starts we
10:08 - reset the timer now we can make the time
10:11 - of visible on screen by clicking this
10:12 - little timer box here
10:15 - there it is there but the pond with that
10:17 - is that the timer is changing all the
10:20 - time even when we're dead even when
10:23 - we've won so that's not quite as useful
10:25 - so let's stop that so not making this
10:28 - timer visible let's create our own
10:29 - available called time nightmare and all
10:36 - uppercase cuz it could be for all
10:37 - sprites this and let's click it double
10:43 - click it to make it into a nice
10:45 - single box like that
10:48 - just put it in the middle there for now
10:50 - and we're going to update that to be a
10:52 - nice time that's displayed on the screen
10:56 - so what we're going to do is put this
10:58 - into right at the beginning of this
11:00 - repeat until the kind of a set and we're
11:04 - going to change time now we could just
11:07 - drop in timer in there like this so if I
11:12 - run that timer starts zero starts moving
11:17 - and when we die timer stops which is
11:20 - what we want and it stays set as it was
11:23 - until we start moving and then it goes
11:25 - back to zero but I don't really want all
11:27 - this it's a bit too big time so let's
11:31 - just change the set time to make it look
11:33 - a little bit nicer let's only have one
11:36 - decimal place so if we get round yeah
11:40 - and then we get the multiply and divide
11:45 - so set time to divide by ten on the left
11:52 - we put round and we have times by
11:58 - 10 and put time on the left so we're
12:01 - going to times time it by 10 round it
12:04 - there's number and then divide it by 10
12:06 - and what that has the effect of doing
12:07 - they start the game is showing just one
12:10 - decimal place if we times by 100 you
12:13 - would show two decimal places okay if we
12:18 - compete the game there we are it stops
12:20 - and shows us what time we got that work
12:23 - it's much nicer like that just wanting
12:25 - to do at the very top of the game before
12:27 - the game loop at all let's run the set
12:30 - time to zero just so that when we
12:33 - started the first time it set to zero
12:35 - rather than the last amount that we
12:37 - played the game
12:39 - that is pretty much it
12:45 - I think we've pretty much got over the
12:46 - need for their game there so you can
12:50 - design the level by coming into the
12:52 - costumes here draw whatever blevells you
12:54 - want you can create the exit you can add
12:58 - new zombies by going into the code
13:03 - and in this script here remember with
13:06 - the unimpressed just move that to the
13:10 - bottom there so that it will always run
13:11 - when II press em so I can now click in
13:13 - here and press m and it'll add new
13:15 - zombies in if you need to delete all the
13:19 - zombies simply go into your scripts here
13:24 - and you can say delete all mobs as soon
13:27 - as I click that like that run it
13:32 - there's no zombies see and if I want to
13:35 - add new ones in move that below and I'll
13:38 - click here click here and I'll click
13:41 - here I'm clicking the M key by the way
13:43 - run it now and there you are far too
13:47 - many
13:48 - okay so again I can delete them all by
13:51 - clicking on delete all mobs it's like
13:54 - this run it again all gone so I want to
13:58 - press one up here one down there and
14:02 - then run it
14:04 - there you go so it's really easy okay
14:07 - that's it I'm gonna stop the tutorial I
14:10 - hope that was a helpful tutorial for you
14:11 - and that you enjoyed it
14:12 - do you subscribe to me I'm Grif match
14:14 - and thank you for watching bye now

Cleaned transcript:

hi sis Grif patch welcome to part 5 of my topdown scrolling tutorial for scratch in this episode we're going up the project had in a ending screen and the timer and really just wrap up the game so I hope you will enjoy this let's get on with it what we need now is a way of winning the level now in was Amba cube why did for that is just add a colorful exit so let's go into costumes and we'll add in a new color for the exit now the exit can be a light blue color like this so let me just add in an exit over here so that's our exit now when I get and touch that I want it to finish the game so I just come over here a second there we go as soon as I walk onto that product finish I don't want to finish my touch it I want I it to be completely on top of it to finish the game and we can do that I go into the player later okay so we've got the touching enemy there I can borrow that and also have it for touching the exit so if I have another touching at the bottom here so touching no not zombie touching color so if I am touching this blue color like this then I'm going to set the game to win now that at the moment would end as soon as I touch it not close I'm sitting on top of it so I need another special little trick here so I need another if statement inside and I'm gonna say I'm not touching and I'm going to choose the background color so if I'm touching the blue exit and I'm not touching the black so any way that can happen is if I'm actually right on top of it because I'm touching a black otherwise you see an end is set to win at the moment that will be the same as dying because there is no difference between winning and dying I'll just restart the game but watch this so I'm now overlapping it and as soon as I go over it restarts so it is working I just need to actually have an exit so at the moment down here in the main game loop at the end if ended die I shape the screen otherwise it's going to be winning and so what we need here is the wind screen so what I shall do in there is create a new custom block called win and again don't run without screen refresh leave that unchecked so here it is but win in there the position that booty again and then whatever I want to do when I win has to happen here so what are we going to do when we win but be the best thing to do would be to put a well done you have one message on the screen so let's add in a U of one message so when it does this win let's do a broadcast and wait it's gonna be a new message maybe you won so and let's create a new sprite paint and we're gonna call this for now and I'm going to call the costume win as well and I'm going to write some text on the screen what color we're going to do it in let's do it in okay look let's do it in black to start with and we're going to use the pixel font you win like that okay now this is quite a nice little trick watch this if I grab the corner make it bigger of that of course does not show up on the screen nicely but watch this if I copy it and paste it you can use these buttons do that if you want to always positions if you zoomed out five pixels to the right five down so if I use the arrow keys I can press it five times up one two three four five and the left five one two three four five then that exactly over the top of each other then change the outline to be white you can start see that appearing and bump up the width to be maybe four five maybe five and then click back now I've got an outline around my font book which is quite funky you can choose the width the outline using this so I can make it really big and that what's really well with the pixel font very perfect thing like that's one thing you don't have to like that any kind of wind thing you like and I can group that together so there's a you win sign and I can move that to somewhere on the screen where I want it let me slightly up at the buff like that okay code so when I receive and this is going to be set up to hide this message that and when I receive my win you won I want to show my message so what I'm going to do in here is I'm going to just pause the game and that'll be the end of the game until you press the green flag again so I'm gonna have a control then gonna have a forever and then I mean I just put a weight in there like that so it's gonna loop forever one more thing of course I need to put a goto X Y and I'm gonna have zero zero so it appears in the middle so let's just see if this works okay here I go I need to make it onto the exit and I won perfect and if I die I died so you might want a bit of text on screen here saying press any key to start let's do that as well already we use this wind sprite so if I do play that I can right click in here so that's right to press any key to start okay so shrink that down so it fits on the screen like that and I'm going to create the little bit of background so copy paste you've up by 5 1 2 3 4 5 left by 500 3 4 5 give it a walk now order white make it slightly thicker and to back I'll make it for 5 thick okay so hopefully actually might need to be thicker than that let's have a look so in the code that's over when I receive in fact let's do it in the setup so we've already got it so so rather than hiding let's get rid of that what we actually want to do is duplicate the code from the win go to 00 show no forever loop I want it here instead is a set costume Oh didn't name it win that's no use let's call it ready okay switch to the ready costume and show it so that means at the very beginning it has the press any key to start move that down a little bit it's too high what I realize now having just written that it's actually that's probably a better way of doing this what I'm going to do not call this a setup I'm going to have a new message and I'm gonna call this ready like that okay so this is will be broadcast when it's time to start a game it'll set the costume and I'm going to put the weight for any key press in here so let's put in the wait until and sensing and we're going to put in here the key pressed any key and when we press any key we're going to hide this message okay so then go into player where we've got the any key here and instead of doing that let's do a broadcast and wait so broadcast ready at and then we can get rid of that wait any key because the ready is and they do it for us since if ago so there's the press any key and then not winning on it putting the key it disappears and we're off I as the key we off died okay only one thing left to do and that is have a timer to see how long it took us to complete that level so let's have a go at that simplest way of doing that is that in sensing we have a timer here so let's call the reset timer just before we start our repeat until loop our game so

click here and I'll click here I'm clicking the M key by the way run it now and there you are far too many okay so again I can delete them all by clicking on delete all mobs it's like this run it again all gone so I want to press one up here one down there and then run it there you go so it's really easy okay that's it I'm gonna stop the tutorial I hope that was a helpful tutorial for you and
