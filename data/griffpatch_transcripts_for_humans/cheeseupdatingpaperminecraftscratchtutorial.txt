00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers ever wanted to
00:05 - add your own items and blocks to paper
00:07 - Minecraft well today I'll show you how
00:10 - demonstrating by adding the hugely
00:12 - significant cheese block perfect because
00:16 - it will allow me to show you how to set
00:18 - up smelting crafting and eating not to
00:21 - mention you'll get to see me build my
00:23 - dream house excellent now I've no doubt
00:26 - that soon you'll be creating the most
00:28 - awesome mods of your very own the most
00:30 - creative mods will be featured in my
00:32 - very next modding video so go to town
00:34 - and have a lot of fun and post your mods
00:36 - in a studio Linked In the description
00:38 - under this video okay Shall We Begin
00:42 - load up the latest version of paper
00:44 - Minecraft if you need it there's a link
00:46 - to that too in the description Now remix
00:49 - and the fun really begins just a word of
00:52 - advice this is a large project and if
00:55 - you find scratch tells you it just can't
00:57 - save try clicking the green flag to
00:59 - reset the project and that should solve
01:01 - the problem and it will save once more
01:04 - great I am going to add a cheese block
01:07 - so I need some cheese costumes now you
01:10 - won't be surprised that the Minecraft
01:12 - Community already has some suitable
01:14 - content that I could borrow I could have
01:16 - grabbed the assets from the rat mod
01:18 - webpage but for the best quality I went
01:21 - ahead and extracted the original images
01:23 - from the rat mod source files if you
01:26 - need them to then those will be linked
01:28 - in the description also back in scratch
01:31 - then we need to add the costumes to the
01:33 - tile Sprite this is just full of
01:37 - Minecraft blocks and item costumes just
01:40 - make sure you always add the new
01:42 - costumes to the bottom of the list
01:44 - changing the costume numbers of existing
01:46 - items will really mess up the game
01:48 - so here's my new cheese block we just
01:51 - need to ensure it's correctly sized
01:53 - select all with control a and drag while
01:57 - holding alt to keep it centered the
01:59 - final size wants to be exactly 10 of
02:02 - these grid squares tall or a 40 by 40
02:05 - pixel costume if you want to go by the
02:07 - costume size
02:09 - now repeat this for as many costumes as
02:11 - you need it's a little trickier though
02:13 - for non-block items as this sizing is a
02:16 - little harder to gauge it's actually two
02:18 - and a half times larger than the
02:20 - imported costume if you want to know
02:22 - okay I want these cheese items first so
02:26 - paper Minecraft is super meta we have
02:30 - many lists of data that drive the game
02:32 - engine the block data list make it
02:36 - visible contains information on each and
02:38 - every tile and item in the game now we
02:42 - could edit this list directly in scratch
02:44 - but to be honest it's much easier to
02:46 - handle if we right click the list and
02:48 - choose to export it to our computer
02:51 - then we can load up the list in notepad
02:53 - or notepad plus plus if you have that
02:56 - because I love being able to clone the
02:59 - view this opens the same file twice side
03:03 - by side and you'll see why this is cool
03:05 - in a moment
03:06 - this text file follows a record
03:08 - structure each record is 20 lines long
03:12 - and separated from the next record by a
03:15 - single blank line a record exists for
03:18 - every tile or item in paper Minecraft
03:20 - this top record though is a special
03:23 - header record as it just tells us what
03:25 - each line of a record is used for
03:28 - the best way to add a new block is by
03:30 - copying a record that's already there
03:32 - our cheese item is similar to any small
03:36 - item so how about we copy a gold ingot
03:39 - it's costume number 42.
03:42 - now in the text file we search up the
03:44 - number 42. and here we go you can see
03:47 - the title gold ingot and the item number
03:50 - just above it and above that a single
03:53 - space that separates the records so this
03:56 - gold ingot is item number 84. item
03:59 - numbers are not linked to costumes at
04:02 - all it's worth remembering that so
04:04 - select the entire record all 20 lines
04:07 - and copy them to your clipboard we'll
04:10 - drop down to the end of the text
04:12 - document and paste these at the end
04:15 - making sure to leave only a single blank
04:18 - line between this new record and our
04:20 - previous one don't leave any more or
04:22 - less otherwise this will not work
04:26 - so this is where having the second view
04:29 - of this file comes in useful I can match
04:31 - up the lines of our record with the
04:34 - header lines from the top of this
04:35 - document
04:37 - see the description matching up with the
04:39 - description line here now we edit the
04:42 - item number first this must always
04:44 - follow on from the previous record that
04:47 - was
04:48 - 287 so the next number is 288.
04:53 - next we give it a name piece of cheese
04:57 - none of the other settings are important
04:59 - right now except row 15 here tells us
05:02 - which category under the creative menu
05:04 - the block should be filed under perhaps
05:07 - materials that's an eight
05:10 - tile Sprite ID now this is the costume
05:14 - number of this tile cheese is 308 pop
05:17 - that in 308.
05:20 - we get to specify the costume again just
05:23 - in case we want a different costume when
05:25 - it's displayed in the inventory 308
05:28 - again though
05:29 - and then here's the last change row 19
05:31 - says root item id well what does that
05:34 - mean items with the same root ID can be
05:37 - used interchangeably for crafting so you
05:40 - might have all the woods with the same
05:41 - number if not just enter its own block
05:44 - ID to keep it unique 288.
05:48 - cool now before we move back into
05:51 - scratch make sure to save this text file
05:54 - to your computer
05:55 - then we right-click the list in scratch
05:58 - and this time import selecting our
06:01 - updated block data text file
06:04 - okay might be worth scooting down and
06:07 - confirming the new block is there in the
06:09 - bottom
06:11 - yep piece of cake I mean cheese
06:13 - excellent we are ready for a quick test
06:16 - Hi D Block datalist before smashing the
06:18 - green flag and jump right into creative
06:21 - mode under the materials right
06:24 - yes there it is a piece of cheese and
06:28 - the tool tip works too I love that hey
06:30 - is cheese throwing a thing I think I
06:33 - might have invented a new game
06:35 - now I really wish we had cauldrons in
06:38 - paper Minecraft for curdling our milk
06:40 - into cheese but the next best thing
06:42 - would be a furnace smelting milk into
06:44 - cheese will have to do and it's dead
06:46 - easy to configure it's there in the
06:49 - block data header smelt into block ID so
06:52 - just remember that our cheese is item
06:54 - number 288 and then find the word milk
06:57 - in our block list here we go this must
07:01 - be the bucket of milk record I'll just
07:03 - line it up with the headers and then
07:05 - line 12 is the smelting so just replace
07:07 - that zero there with 288 a piece of
07:10 - cheese
07:11 - the next line is important too burn in
07:14 - furnace duration in seconds set that to
07:17 - 10 seconds I'll keep it short so that I
07:19 - can show you it working right make sure
07:22 - to save this file again and then in
07:25 - scratch re-import it into the block data
07:27 - list
07:30 - go go go a furnace a bucket of milk and
07:33 - some coal there's nothing like warm milk
07:36 - on a cold day or cheese what a happy
07:39 - surprise hey where'd my bucket go
07:42 - well back to my favorite pastime cheese
07:44 - throwing
07:46 - now let's add that block of cheese
07:48 - costume 309 this one is a placeable
07:51 - block two so this will be fun we can
07:53 - begin by finding and copying the dirt
07:55 - block as that is the most simple solid
07:58 - block
07:59 - paste it down at the bottom without
08:01 - obligofy single blank line to separate
08:03 - it from the previous record
08:07 - we need to increase the block ID from
08:10 - 288 so this will now be block ID 289
08:15 - great line up the headings name block of
08:19 - cheese yes it's a solid block this time
08:21 - and the hardness can be soft like dirt
08:24 - 0.5 you can look these numbers up on the
08:26 - Minecraft Wiki digging tool we don't
08:29 - even need a spade s for this so set this
08:32 - to n or no tool required this isn't a
08:35 - liquid it doesn't fall like sand or
08:37 - gravel tile group we can use this to
08:40 - give the tile sound when we walk on it
08:42 - or apply other game properties but no we
08:44 - don't need that for this block now when
08:46 - the block is harvested we don't want to
08:48 - switch it for another block no so leave
08:50 - that as zero we're not smelting or
08:52 - getting hurt by the block ah now then
08:55 - the creative mode category I've decided
08:57 - we should probably recategorize the
08:59 - cheeses under the food studs that's
09:01 - number five
09:02 - tile Sprite ID for cheese Block Wars
09:05 - costume number 309 enter that in and
09:09 - repeat that again for the inventory
09:10 - costume
09:11 - 309. lastly the root ID needs to be the
09:14 - same as the number of the block ID 289
09:20 - and that's all of it except to go back
09:22 - and make the piece of cheese appear
09:24 - under the foodstuffs category as well a
09:26 - change from 8 to 5 foodstuffs
09:29 - yay save the file and back into scratch
09:32 - import the updated block list
09:36 - feeling good about this we can see the
09:38 - cheese item and block are both in the
09:40 - foodstuffs category yay so cool because
09:44 - now I can finally build my dream house
09:47 - man what's not to love
09:50 - that is so cool
09:52 - and now what would Minecraft be without
09:55 - crafting how about we add a crafting
09:58 - recipe to craft a cheese block from four
10:01 - pieces of cheese and for this we need to
10:03 - locate another scratch list the recipes
10:06 - list it's not as complex as the block
10:09 - data list but still worth exporting to
10:11 - your PC for easier editing if you can
10:14 - you'll see there are only four lines to
10:17 - each record in the list recipe
10:19 - description
10:20 - product that's the item number quantity
10:23 - that's how many items you craft in one
10:25 - go and the recipe itself more on that in
10:29 - a moment
10:30 - just select the top record the four
10:33 - lines starting with the words wooden
10:35 - plank and copy that to the clipboard
10:37 - we'll paste this at the bottom of the
10:40 - file as before leaving a gap of one line
10:42 - between records and now we modify this
10:45 - new record my block data list is still
10:48 - open here on the right so I can find the
10:51 - details or the block of cheese in there
10:53 - copy the name and paste it into our
10:56 - recipe
10:57 - also the block number is 289 this is for
11:01 - the block being crafted
11:03 - the quantity is the count of items
11:06 - crafted just one for the block of cheese
11:08 - one block of cheese from four pieces and
11:11 - lastly we have the encoded recipe let's
11:14 - go over how this is formatted
11:17 - is the crafting table for our cheese
11:19 - block always ensure the recipe is pushed
11:21 - to the bottom left of the table
11:24 - we enter the item number for the piece
11:26 - of cheese 288 and any empty tiles we
11:29 - write in as a hash symbol
11:32 - and now what we do is begin at the
11:35 - bottom left and we write out the three
11:37 - digit number two eight eight if the
11:40 - number was shorter than three digits
11:42 - like say the number seven then we'd pad
11:45 - it out with leading spaces space space
11:48 - seven so it's always three characters
11:51 - long
11:52 - the next number is 288 again so we enter
11:56 - that right after the last without
11:58 - leaving a gap two eight eight and again
12:01 - we would pad that out with spaces to the
12:03 - left if needed
12:04 - then the hash and this 2 is padded out
12:08 - to the left with spaces so this is space
12:10 - space hash we repeat this onto the next
12:14 - line two eight eight two eight eight
12:16 - space space hash and the final row space
12:20 - space hash space space hash space space
12:23 - Ash and that's it I'll enter the
12:26 - completed recipe under the last just so
12:28 - that we can compare and notice how the
12:30 - columns line up and the three digit
12:32 - numbers are all right aligned padded out
12:35 - with spaces to their left
12:37 - good let's delete that old row above
12:40 - that's important
12:42 - so save the file the file
12:44 - then come back into
12:46 - support the new recipes file
12:52 - and we are good to smash that green flag
12:55 - now stock up with pieces of cheese then
12:59 - press T to talk and enter forward slash
13:01 - GM for game mode space s a survival that
13:05 - switches us to survival mode and we can
13:07 - test out a bit of crafting
13:10 - use the space key to separate out those
13:12 - cheeses
13:13 - wow nice the recipe worked that's so
13:17 - cool and so fun let's do it again haha
13:20 - there's no stopping us now
13:23 - how about we add the reverse recipe to
13:25 - split the blocks back into four cheeses
13:27 - we duplicate the previous recipe leaving
13:30 - a single line Gap we are crafting a
13:33 - piece of cheese
13:37 - that's item number 288
13:41 - and we want to craft four pieces from
13:43 - one block and the recipe code is a
13:45 - single tile of 289 the block of cheese
13:49 - had the rest out with space space hashes
13:54 - and Save
13:57 - and import the text file back into
13:58 - scratch
14:03 - and test grab a block of cheese jump
14:06 - into survival and craft three blocks of
14:10 - cheese make 12 pieces of cheese Splendid
14:13 - and we can craft them back into blocks
14:15 - at whim
14:17 - so apart from building houses what can
14:19 - we do with these cheeses hey villager
14:22 - want some cheese no well wait I can't
14:25 - eat the cheese yeah there's yet another
14:28 - list to be looked at the food data list
14:31 - shall we export it and take a look
14:38 - more format I'll clone it to the other
14:40 - View and we can check out how it works
14:42 - here's a cake which is block ID of 111
14:46 - in our game
14:48 - we just copy all six lines and then
14:50 - moving down to the bottom of the file
14:52 - paste it in with a single line Gap as
14:55 - normal
14:56 - so we want to eat a piece of cheese
15:00 - that's 288 a piece of cheese I can paste
15:03 - those two lines right in
15:06 - hunger points is next now luckily I can
15:09 - look these values up in the rat mod wiki
15:12 - hunger points is three see stuff that
15:16 - value in and the saturation that affects
15:18 - how long it is before you need to eat
15:20 - again and this value is 0.5 cool chance
15:25 - of food poisoning nah we don't need that
15:27 - and after eating nothing remains so
15:29 - leave that too we are done save the file
15:33 - and go back into scratch and you know
15:35 - what to do import the list
15:39 - and run the project filling up with the
15:43 - cheese now
15:44 - and eat ah ah okay of course I'm not
15:48 - hungry yet well I guess I'd better do
15:50 - some exercise hold on
15:53 - [Music]
15:55 - and it's dinner time
15:58 - yeah well I hope you enjoyed this quick
16:02 - tutorial on modding paper Minecraft if
16:05 - you did then smash that like button and
16:07 - make sure to subscribe to my channel not
16:09 - to miss the next exciting video drop me
16:12 - a comment if you want to see further

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers ever wanted to add your own items and blocks to paper Minecraft well today I'll show you how demonstrating by adding the hugely significant cheese block perfect because it will allow me to show you how to set up smelting crafting and eating not to mention you'll get to see me build my dream house excellent now I've no doubt that soon you'll be creating the most awesome mods of your very own the most creative mods will be featured in my very next modding video so go to town and have a lot of fun and post your mods in a studio Linked In the description under this video okay Shall We Begin load up the latest version of paper Minecraft if you need it there's a link to that too in the description Now remix and the fun really begins just a word of advice this is a large project and if you find scratch tells you it just can't save try clicking the green flag to reset the project and that should solve the problem and it will save once more great I am going to add a cheese block so I need some cheese costumes now you won't be surprised that the Minecraft Community already has some suitable content that I could borrow I could have grabbed the assets from the rat mod webpage but for the best quality I went ahead and extracted the original images from the rat mod source files if you need them to then those will be linked in the description also back in scratch then we need to add the costumes to the tile Sprite this is just full of Minecraft blocks and item costumes just make sure you always add the new costumes to the bottom of the list changing the costume numbers of existing items will really mess up the game so here's my new cheese block we just need to ensure it's correctly sized select all with control a and drag while holding alt to keep it centered the final size wants to be exactly 10 of these grid squares tall or a 40 by 40 pixel costume if you want to go by the costume size now repeat this for as many costumes as you need it's a little trickier though for nonblock items as this sizing is a little harder to gauge it's actually two and a half times larger than the imported costume if you want to know okay I want these cheese items first so paper Minecraft is super meta we have many lists of data that drive the game engine the block data list make it visible contains information on each and every tile and item in the game now we could edit this list directly in scratch but to be honest it's much easier to handle if we right click the list and choose to export it to our computer then we can load up the list in notepad or notepad plus plus if you have that because I love being able to clone the view this opens the same file twice side by side and you'll see why this is cool in a moment this text file follows a record structure each record is 20 lines long and separated from the next record by a single blank line a record exists for every tile or item in paper Minecraft this top record though is a special header record as it just tells us what each line of a record is used for the best way to add a new block is by copying a record that's already there our cheese item is similar to any small item so how about we copy a gold ingot it's costume number 42. now in the text file we search up the number 42. and here we go you can see the title gold ingot and the item number just above it and above that a single space that separates the records so this gold ingot is item number 84. item numbers are not linked to costumes at all it's worth remembering that so select the entire record all 20 lines and copy them to your clipboard we'll drop down to the end of the text document and paste these at the end making sure to leave only a single blank line between this new record and our previous one don't leave any more or less otherwise this will not work so this is where having the second view of this file comes in useful I can match up the lines of our record with the header lines from the top of this document see the description matching up with the description line here now we edit the item number first this must always follow on from the previous record that was 287 so the next number is 288. next we give it a name piece of cheese none of the other settings are important right now except row 15 here tells us which category under the creative menu the block should be filed under perhaps materials that's an eight tile Sprite ID now this is the costume number of this tile cheese is 308 pop that in 308. we get to specify the costume again just in case we want a different costume when it's displayed in the inventory 308 again though and then here's the last change row 19 says root item id well what does that mean items with the same root ID can be used interchangeably for crafting so you might have all the woods with the same number if not just enter its own block ID to keep it unique 288. cool now before we move back into scratch make sure to save this text file to your computer then we rightclick the list in scratch and this time import selecting our updated block data text file okay might be worth scooting down and confirming the new block is there in the bottom yep piece of cake I mean cheese excellent we are ready for a quick test Hi D Block datalist before smashing the green flag and jump right into creative mode under the materials right yes there it is a piece of cheese and the tool tip works too I love that hey is cheese throwing a thing I think I might have invented a new game now I really wish we had cauldrons in paper Minecraft for curdling our milk into cheese but the next best thing would be a furnace smelting milk into cheese will have to do and it's dead easy to configure it's there in the block data header smelt into block ID so just remember that our cheese is item number 288 and then find the word milk in our block list here we go this must be the bucket of milk record I'll just line it up with the headers and then line 12 is the smelting so just replace that zero there with 288 a piece of cheese the next line is important too burn in furnace duration in seconds set that to 10 seconds I'll keep it short so that I can show you it working right make sure to save this file again and then in scratch reimport it into the block data list go go go a furnace a bucket of milk and some coal there's nothing like warm milk on a cold day or cheese what a happy surprise hey where'd my bucket go well back to my favorite pastime cheese throwing now let's add that block of cheese costume 309 this one is a placeable block two so this will be fun we can begin by finding and copying the dirt block as that is the most simple solid block paste it down at the bottom without obligofy single blank line to separate it from the previous record we need to increase the block ID from 288 so this will now be block ID 289 great line up the headings name block of cheese yes it's a solid block this time and the hardness can be soft like dirt 0.5 you can look these numbers up on the Minecraft Wiki digging tool we don't even need a spade s for this so set this to n or no tool required this isn't a liquid it doesn't fall like sand or gravel tile group we can use this to give the tile sound when we walk on it or apply other game properties but no we don't need that for this block now when the block is harvested we don't want to switch it for another block no so leave that as zero we're not smelting or getting hurt by the block ah now then the creative mode category I've decided we should probably recategorize the cheeses under the food studs that's number five tile Sprite ID for cheese Block Wars costume number 309 enter that in and repeat that again for the inventory costume 309. lastly the root ID needs to be the same as the number of the block ID 289 and that's all of it except to go back and make the piece of cheese appear under the foodstuffs category as well a change from 8 to 5 foodstuffs yay save the file and back into scratch import the updated block list feeling good about this we can see the cheese item and block are both in the foodstuffs category yay so cool because now I can finally build my dream house man what's not to love that is so cool and now what would Minecraft be without crafting how about we add a crafting recipe to craft a cheese block from four pieces of cheese and for this we need to locate another scratch list the recipes list it's not as complex as the block data list but still worth exporting to your PC for easier editing if you can you'll see there are only four lines to each record in the list recipe description product that's the item number quantity that's how many items you craft in one go and the recipe itself more on that in a moment just select the top record the four lines starting with the words wooden plank and copy that to the clipboard we'll paste this at the bottom of the file as before leaving a gap of one line between records and now we modify this new record my block data list is still open here on the right so I can find the details or the block of cheese in there copy the name and paste it into our recipe also the block number is 289 this is for the block being crafted the quantity is the count of items crafted just one for the block of cheese one block of cheese from four pieces and lastly we have the encoded recipe let's go over how this is formatted is the crafting table for our cheese block always ensure the recipe is pushed to the bottom left of the table we enter the item number for the piece of cheese 288 and any empty tiles we write in as a hash symbol and now what we do is begin at the bottom left and we write out the three digit number two eight eight if the number was shorter than three digits like say the number seven then we'd pad it out with leading spaces space space seven so it's always three characters long the next number is 288 again so we enter that right after the last without leaving a gap two eight eight and again we would pad that out with spaces to the left if needed then the hash and this 2 is padded out to the left with spaces so this is space space hash we repeat this onto the next line two eight eight two eight eight space space hash and the final row space space hash space space hash space space Ash and that's it I'll enter the completed recipe under the last just so that we can compare and notice how the columns line up and the three digit numbers are all right aligned padded out with spaces to their left good let's delete that old row above that's important so save the file the file then come back into support the new recipes file and we are good to smash that green flag now stock up with pieces of cheese then press T to talk and enter forward slash GM for game mode space s a survival that switches us to survival mode and we can test out a bit of crafting use the space key to separate out those cheeses wow nice the recipe worked that's so cool and so fun let's do it again haha there's no stopping us now how about we add the reverse recipe to split the blocks back into four cheeses we duplicate the previous recipe leaving a single line Gap we are crafting a piece of cheese that's item number 288 and we want to craft four pieces from one block and the recipe code is a single tile of 289 the block of cheese had the rest out with space space hashes and Save and import the text file back into scratch and test grab a block of cheese jump into survival and craft three blocks of cheese make 12 pieces of cheese Splendid and we can craft them back into blocks at whim so apart from building houses what can we do with these cheeses hey villager want some cheese no well wait I can't eat the cheese yeah there's yet another list to be looked at the food data list shall we export it and take a look more format I'll clone it to the other View and we can check out how it works here's a cake which is block ID of 111 in our game we just copy all six lines and then moving down to the bottom of the file paste it in with a single line Gap as normal so we want to eat a piece of cheese that's 288 a piece of cheese I can paste those two lines right in hunger points is next now luckily I can look these values up in the rat mod wiki hunger points is three see stuff that value in and the saturation that affects how long it is before you need to eat again and this value is 0.5 cool chance of food poisoning nah we don't need that and after eating nothing remains so leave that too we are done save the file and go back into scratch and you know what to do import the list and run the project filling up with the cheese now and eat ah ah okay of course I'm not hungry yet well I guess I'd better do some exercise hold on and it's dinner time yeah well
