00:01 - hello fellow scratchers I'm super
00:03 - excited to introduce you to my next
00:05 - scratch coding tutorial based on the
00:08 - hugely popular Plant versus Zombies the
00:11 - series begins this week in the Griff
00:13 - patch Academy and the doors close in
00:15 - just a few days to learn more follow the
00:17 - link under this video guys welcome to
00:21 - Backyard battle if you've played Plants
00:24 - versus Zombies then this will be
00:25 - instantly recognizable I've tried to
00:27 - reproduce all the best mechanics first
00:30 - check out this drag and drop
00:31 - functionality you can easily snatch up a
00:33 - bot and place it anywhere on the grid
00:36 - notice how everything snaps perfectly
00:38 - into place thanks to our precise grid
00:40 - alignment once your Bots are in position
00:43 - they'll automatically detect and engage
00:45 - the Alien Invaders Sprite to Sprite
00:48 - Collision detection between clones
00:49 - ensures each encounter is accurately
00:51 - tracked and handled managing resources
00:55 - is key to building a strong defense we
00:57 - need to collect sun power which is used
00:59 - as a currency to build new robots solar
01:03 - Bots generate more sun power helping you
01:05 - gather resources quicker different Bots
01:07 - have unique abilities to help you fend
01:10 - off the aliens Gunner Bots fire
01:12 - projectiles and this again involves
01:14 - detecting two-way collisions bomb Bots
01:17 - have a satisfying timed fuse and can
01:19 - take out a whole load of aliens all at
01:21 - once Shield Bots have far more health
01:24 - and are great for blocking the path of
01:26 - oncoming aliens lastly we have Lane
01:30 - guard Bots that sit at the left edge of
01:32 - the lawn acting as a last line of
01:34 - defense literally very cool in the first
01:38 - level you only have to defend a single
01:40 - Lane of lawn and you only have a simple
01:42 - Gunner bot at your disposal but as you
01:45 - progress through the levels you'll add
01:46 - more bot types to Your Arsenal but
01:49 - equally you'll have to guard more Lanes
01:52 - as the game advances waves of enemies
01:54 - will become more challenging we'll
01:57 - create an alien scheduler to encode
01:59 - these waves
02:00 - increasing the difficulty over the
02:02 - course of the game to keep it exciting
02:03 - and engaging so there you have it this
02:07 - is just a sneak peek at what we'll be
02:09 - building together in this series from
02:11 - Sprite Collision detection to Resource
02:13 - Management from a variety of bots to
02:15 - encoded enemy waves we've got a lot of
02:18 - exciting content ahead so I cannot wait
02:21 - to see you in the next lesson where
02:23 - we'll begin this journey together
02:24 - creating backyard Battle Bots versus
02:28 - aliens
