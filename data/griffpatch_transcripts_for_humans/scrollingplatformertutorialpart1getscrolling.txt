00:00 - hi today I'm starting a new scratch
00:02 - tutorial on scrolling platformers I'm
00:05 - gonna be trying to create this little
00:08 - game here which I thought we a good way
00:09 - of going about a tutorial we've got a
00:12 - solid scrolling platformer we've got
00:15 - larva as we live lava
00:17 - we've got collectibles we've got the
00:18 - starting animation we've got jumping
00:20 - we've got a portal at the end here which
00:22 - we go into and it takes us on to the
00:24 - next level we've got a timer we've got
00:28 - yeah collision detection everything we
00:30 - need to start of a really good
00:32 - platformer so this is what we're going
00:34 - to be building today but of course this
00:37 - was the first part and it's going to be
00:38 - just the simple part of to creating the
00:40 - scrolling and and adding a little bit of
00:44 - movement in okay let's start a new
00:47 - project okay hello scrunchy so what do
00:55 - we need
00:55 - first of all sprites so it started with
00:59 - sprite - I'm gonna write this point -
01:01 - not sprite one it was a sprite one that
01:03 - confuses me straight away anyhow doesn't
01:05 - matter let's rename this one so click on
01:07 - the little arrow there and let's type in
01:09 - player this is gonna be us there we go
01:14 - player much better now we don't want to
01:17 - scratch cat for this example we want a
01:18 - nice simple little graphic I'm gonna
01:20 - quickly just drag one in from my
01:22 - backpack because I it's very simple zoom
01:28 - in for you just a little bit map square
01:30 - people on scratch love square so space
01:33 - that's fine we let's just do that tell
01:35 - you those there we go and I'm gonna call
01:37 - him they go as well there we go
01:40 - player great and now he's available so
01:43 - go back to the scripts has had in some
01:45 - spare balls in the data tab make
01:47 - variable now I'm going to create for all
01:51 - sprites and I'm going to use these in
01:53 - capitals so that we can remember they
01:55 - are for all sprites you have one four
01:57 - level which is the level we're on that's
01:59 - great I'm gonna make another one again
02:02 - in all caps called scroll X
02:08 - that's how far across the level we've
02:09 - scrolled another one called scroll why
02:13 - okay so there we go three variables like
02:16 - that and therefore every sprite now we
02:19 - can hide those for now now make another
02:22 - variable this time lowercase and we'll
02:26 - do it just for this sprite it's gonna be
02:28 - X so I'll just create that and another
02:31 - one y again for this sprite only that's
02:36 - great when we're using scrolling games
02:40 - often we have to hold a position you
02:41 - know another variable rather than just
02:43 - using the normal go to position of push
02:46 - and x position Y I'll show that later
02:47 - why that's the case
02:49 - okay that's a little player created now
02:52 - let's create the background platform
02:54 - so let's duplicate yeah by
02:57 - right-clicking on player create another
02:59 - sprite and we're gonna name it as like
03:08 - that okay go to costumes and we need to
03:13 - draw a quick level let's just create a
03:16 - new costume get rid of the player
03:20 - costume don't need that and we'll call
03:22 - it level space one space one so this is
03:29 - level one and the first part of level
03:32 - one okay there we go and we're gonna do
03:35 - it in the vector editor simplicity draw
03:38 - a line and we're just going to draw and
03:42 - make it slightly thicker line I'm gonna
03:45 - draw a cross and if you click like this
03:47 - and then hold down shift it constrains
03:49 - us to drawing straight lines see that
03:51 - before I let go so I'll go over here and
03:54 - I'll let go there we go so a nice
03:56 - straight line for us to walk around on
03:58 - top so I notice it's not actually
04:02 - visible on the screen which is not very
04:03 - useful is that any particular reason
04:06 - it's showing it must be off-screen let's
04:10 - go to motion and click on go to it is
04:14 - right off the bottom let's put that back
04:16 - on what should we do let's get the
04:18 - player moving
04:19 - so click on player and we'll add in when
04:24 - green flag clicked like so and what
04:28 - we're gonna do is broadcast and wait now
04:31 - I'm gonna do this like this just as a
04:33 - set up so that it's going to make it
04:34 - really easy for later on so I'm gonna
04:36 - broadcast my own little thing called
04:40 - green flag this is I have more control
04:44 - over all these scripts like when the
04:45 - green flag is clicked so I'll only ever
04:47 - have one actual green flag and I'll
04:49 - thought cast my own group like it's now
04:51 - on and and then I'm gonna broadcast it
04:55 - gained and this time another new message
04:59 - I'm gonna broadcast play game great so
05:04 - that's the first script so let's do a
05:06 - receiver for that first green flag okay
05:13 - so it's gonna go in here and then go to
05:14 - me blank and in here we're gonna hide
05:18 - this is like setting up the game so
05:21 - we're gonna hide the character and we're
05:23 - gonna go to front then we're gonna have
05:27 - another receiver for the player game
05:32 - okay so when we play the game let's just
05:35 - give it to this so what we're gonna do
05:38 - when we start playing a game is set
05:40 - level to one like that that's to a
05:45 - forever loop here okay and so we're
05:50 - gonna stop playing a game I'm gonna go
05:51 - into a loop and the first thing we need
05:52 - to do is broadcast again I like
05:56 - podcasters you can tell and the first
05:58 - thing we get a broadcast is going to be
06:00 - reset now
06:02 - Dadda this is it's resets the game every
06:04 - time you go round so if you die or if
06:06 - you win a level you're gonna reset the
06:08 - game for this level and after you reset
06:11 - the game you set it up so a new message
06:15 - setup you now need a custom block these
06:20 - are super useful and we will use them a
06:22 - lot but right now I'm gonna create one
06:24 - called game on
06:27 - all you need in that it's like okay okay
06:32 - put that there
06:33 - now move your game on block just there
06:38 - have to set up now this game on what we
06:41 - wanted to do is simply set the position
06:44 - that we want a guy to appear in so we'll
06:47 - have set X and set Y to 0 that sets in
06:51 - way wants just show and we put a show in
06:55 - there so he'll appear on the screen now
06:57 - that's not the same as set position X
06:58 - this is it available X&Y because we're
07:01 - scrolling games so I'm afraid we have to
07:03 - use our local variables for this R
07:05 - despite only variables now after the
07:08 - game on insert a repeat until loop this
07:14 - is going to be the tight loop of the
07:16 - game it's going to go round around in
07:17 - this little loop here so what we're
07:19 - gonna do inside this is another custom
07:22 - block make up block I'm gonna call this
07:25 - tick now this is after the tick tock of
07:27 - a clock because it's a regular tick tick
07:29 - tick tick it's actually going to be
07:30 - taking 30 times a second but for now
07:33 - that's fine I'll just keep that like
07:34 - that
07:34 - and no changes so click OK I'll put the
07:41 - tip in the repeat loop now I'm not
07:43 - putting anything in until yet because I
07:44 - just wanted to keep going forever for
07:46 - now what we can do in tick well what
07:48 - we're gonna do is check for key presses
07:50 - so we got to make a move left and right
07:51 - so add in an if condition and we'll
07:57 - check sensing and key press left left
08:05 - arrow key okay so if left arrow key is
08:07 - pressed what are we gonna do well we're
08:11 - gonna change X by and I'm going to
08:18 - choose minus 8 for a good number and
08:21 - another condition of if right arrow and
08:26 - we're going to change X by 8 so we're
08:28 - moving to the right motion go to X Y I'm
08:34 - just thinking where to put this whether
08:35 - it should be done here or over there
08:37 - let's put it down here for now so what
08:45 - we're gonna do in here I'm gonna need a
08:48 - - inhale both sides I'm gonna position
08:52 - in that X - scroll x and y - scroll why
09:02 - okay
09:03 - and after that one more thing we're
09:06 - gonna add is a broadcasting wait the
09:10 - bottom of this little loop and what
09:12 - we're gonna say in there the new message
09:14 - and it's gonna be tick that okay so
09:20 - right now if we run this project we
09:25 - should find if we press left and right
09:27 - we can be laughing right excellent
09:31 - that's a start of a project so now what
09:35 - we need is the background to scroll so
09:38 - let's change to the platforms script and
09:42 - we'll add in here when I receive green
09:45 - flag not the when I when green flag
09:47 - clicked but my own broadcast so I need a
09:49 - bit more control this and what I want to
09:51 - do in there is for now I want to show my
09:54 - background which I've already got but
09:56 - I'll show you anyway just in case and
09:59 - then we need another event and this time
10:03 - it's tick no more you just broadcast
10:06 - that every time we go around the main
10:08 - loop and in here we need a position so
10:13 - go to X Y again and we're going to
10:16 - position the same as in the other script
10:18 - so I can put in my minuses and I'm gonna
10:23 - position it map X this is the x position
10:26 - of the platform now rather than the
10:28 - little guy like this is for this quite
10:30 - only see - scroll x + y - scroll Y like
10:39 - that
10:39 - now that is that so if I went that now
10:45 - seems exactly the same however if you go
10:49 - in the show with this scroll X here like
10:51 - that now right-click it and say slider
10:55 - you'll see the scroll X is now a slider
10:58 - now if I drag that I see the program is
11:00 - still running look at that I can scroll
11:05 - the screen both the player and the
11:08 - background and I could still move this
11:10 - with the cats keys and I can still
11:13 - scroll the screen okay so what I can do
11:20 - now is link the scrolling the screen to
11:22 - the player so in your main player sprite
11:25 - get your set and just before you
11:29 - position the player so prefer you entry
11:30 - into tick and the go to change the set
11:34 - white just said scroll likes it's all
11:36 - subjects of all X and put the player as
11:41 - x position in there now you see that on
11:45 - the screen when it's running I first
11:47 - left and right now my play standstill
11:50 - the background moves so that is this
11:57 - start that soil I hope you enjoyed that
12:00 - and I shall make the next part very soon

hi today I'm starting a new scratch tutorial on scrolling platformers I'm gonna be trying to create this little game here which I thought we a good way of going about a tutorial we've got a solid scrolling platformer we've got larva as we live lava we've got collectibles we've got the starting animation we've got jumping we've got a portal at the end here which we go into and it takes us on to

that's a little player created now let's create the background platform so let's duplicate yeah by rightclicking on player create another sprite and we're gonna name it as like that okay go to costumes and we need to draw a quick level let's just create a new costume get rid of the player costume don't need that and we'll call it level space one space one so this is level one and the first part of level one okay there we go and we're gonna do it in the vector editor simplicity draw a line and we're just going to draw and make it slightly thicker line I'm gonna draw a cross and if you click like this and then hold down shift it constrains us to drawing straight lines see that before I let go so I'll go over here and I'll let go there we go so a nice straight line for us to walk around on top so I notice it's not actually visible on the screen which is not very useful is that any particular reason it's showing it must be offscreen let's go to motion and click on go to it is right off the bottom let's put that back on what should we do let's get the player moving so click on player and we'll add in when green flag clicked like so and what we're gonna do is broadcast and wait now I'm gonna do this like this just as a set up so that it's going to make it really easy for later on so I'm gonna broadcast my own little thing called green flag this is I have more control over all these scripts like when the green flag is clicked so I'll only ever have one actual green flag and I'll thought cast my own group like it's now on and and then I'm gonna broadcast it gained and this time another new message I'm gonna broadcast play game great so that's the first script so let's do a receiver for that first green flag okay so it's gonna go in here and then go to me blank and in here we're gonna hide this is like setting up the game so we're gonna hide the character and we're gonna go to front then we're gonna have another receiver for the player game okay so when we play the game let's just give it to this so what we're gonna do when we start playing a game is set level to one like that that's to a forever loop here okay and so we're gonna stop playing a game I'm gonna go into a loop and the first thing we need to do is broadcast again I like podcasters you can tell and the first thing we get a broadcast is going to be reset now Dadda this is it's resets the game every time you go round so if you die or if you win a level you're gonna reset the game for this level and after you reset the game you set it up so a new message setup you now need a custom block these are super useful and we will use them a lot but right now I'm gonna create one called game on all you need in that it's like okay okay put that there now move your game on block just there have to set up now this game on what we wanted to do is simply set the position that we want a guy to appear in so we'll have set X and set Y to 0 that sets in way wants just show and we put a show in there so he'll appear on the screen now that's not the same as set position X this is it available X&Y because we're scrolling games so I'm afraid we have to use our local variables for this R despite only variables now after the game on insert a repeat until loop this is going to be the tight loop of the game it's going to go round around in this little loop here so what we're gonna do inside this

but for now that's fine I'll just keep that like that and no changes so click OK I'll put the tip in the repeat loop now I'm not putting anything in until yet because I just wanted to keep going forever for now what we can do in tick well what we're gonna do is check for key presses so we got to make a move left and right so add in an if condition and we'll check sensing and key press left left arrow key okay so if left arrow key is pressed what are we gonna do well we're gonna change X by and I'm going to choose minus 8 for a good number and another condition of if right arrow and we're going to change X by 8 so we're moving to the right motion go to X Y I'm just thinking where to put this whether it should be done here or over there let's put it down here for now so what we're gonna do in here I'm gonna need a inhale both sides I'm gonna position in that X scroll x and y scroll why okay and after that one more thing we're gonna add is a broadcasting wait the bottom of this

player so prefer you entry into tick and the go to change the set white just said scroll likes it's all subjects of all X and put the player as x position in there now you see that on the screen when it's running I first left and right now my play standstill the background moves so that is this start that soil I hope you enjoyed that and I shall make the next part very soon
