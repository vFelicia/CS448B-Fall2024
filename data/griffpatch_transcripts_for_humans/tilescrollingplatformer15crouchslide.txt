00:02 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch
00:05 - this is going to be a short tile
00:07 - scrolling tutorial today because i'm on
00:09 - my holidays woohoo
00:10 - so what are we adding crouching and
00:13 - sliding cool so let's get to it
00:18 - we'll begin by adding support for the
00:20 - down key to begin a crouching action the
00:23 - best place for this is in the existing
00:25 - handle keys jump costume block yeah it's
00:28 - not jumping but it is an up and down
00:30 - movement so we'll rename the custom
00:32 - block to be handle keys jump slash
00:35 - crouch
00:36 - okay we'll separate off the if up block
00:39 - and below and we put in a new if else
00:42 - block here checking for the down of
00:45 - controls being greater than zero if you
00:48 - remember all our key controls are coded
00:50 - in the control sprite now we only want
00:52 - to crouch if we are on the ground not
00:55 - while falling through the air
00:57 - so another if checking whether falling
00:59 - is less than two
01:01 - we are either on the floor or have just
01:03 - been there
01:04 - now we simply set player action to the
01:06 - word crouch
01:08 - this is great as we will now be able to
01:10 - check whether mario is crouching by
01:11 - looking at the player action anywhere
01:13 - else in the code for example to set the
01:16 - costume
01:17 - next up set jump to zero since we are
01:20 - definitely not jumping now
01:22 - so what about when we have let go of the
01:24 - crouch key we check for this in the else
01:27 - where the down key is not pressed
01:29 - if else and check for player action
01:32 - equal to crouch
01:34 - if it was then we'll try setting player
01:36 - action back to the empty value meaning
01:38 - that mario is no longer crouching
01:41 - finally in the second else we are not
01:44 - crouching so bring back the original
01:46 - jumping scripts
01:48 - before we can test this we need to get
01:50 - mario's costume to change too
01:52 - find the define paint sprite and you can
01:55 - see we are already doing a similar thing
01:57 - with the player action of the lose life
01:59 - here
02:01 - we can duplicate that if condition and
02:03 - check instead for a player action of
02:05 - crouch
02:06 - then switch the costume to mario crouch
02:08 - ensuring we still follow that with a
02:10 - stop this script
02:12 - superb let's give that a test
02:15 - press the down key and there you go a
02:17 - brilliant little crouch action right
02:19 - away
02:20 - so can we stop there are we done
02:23 - no i don't think so behold my awesome
02:26 - new crouching sliding mechanic
02:29 - yeah we can still walk around whilst
02:32 - crouching hilarious to watch but not
02:35 - something we want to keep long term
02:37 - however since we can slide now easily
02:39 - around the level let's make use of this
02:41 - to test another required feature of the
02:43 - crouch
02:44 - that of being able to slide into smaller
02:47 - gaps
02:48 - for this we should make some small
02:49 - changes to the level to create a one
02:51 - block high tunnel something like this
02:54 - and now if i slide towards this new
02:56 - obstacle we can see that we have yet
02:59 - some work to do here
03:00 - although mario's costume is the correct
03:02 - size to go through the gap his hit box
03:05 - is not
03:07 - come with me to the define fix
03:09 - collisions in direction script
03:11 - this is where we check six points on
03:14 - mario the bottom left and right middle
03:16 - left and right and top left and right
03:18 - points we could when crouching change
03:22 - the height variable such that mario was
03:24 - shorter
03:25 - but if we do that then mario's feet will
03:27 - lift off the floor since we are centered
03:30 - around the middle point for ease then
03:32 - how about we just stop checking for the
03:34 - top two collision points whilst
03:36 - crouching that would reduce our hitbox
03:39 - by half in height whilst keeping it
03:41 - positioned on the screen correctly
03:44 - we'll start by rearranging the order of
03:46 - these fixed collisions at points so that
03:49 - the second values are paired together
03:52 - there feet first then their middle and
03:55 - then their head good
03:57 - and now surround the last two checks
04:00 - these are the top checks of where
04:02 - mario's head used to be and surround
04:04 - them with an if
04:06 - and we'll only check this when mario is
04:09 - not crouching
04:10 - not player action equals crouch
04:14 - it's testing time so run the project
04:17 - we can start by making sure that we are
04:19 - still prevented from walking into this
04:20 - gap when standing up straight
04:23 - and now crouching
04:25 - yes that's really good our small size
04:28 - lets us slip through the gap now very
04:30 - very good
04:31 - so
04:32 - this means we can now get into a
04:34 - position we couldn't before and that is
04:37 - to be crouching under a block
04:40 - we then have to consider what will
04:41 - happen if we let go of the crouch key
04:44 - while we are still under this block
04:46 - ah so that's what happens
04:48 - as soon as we stand up our hitbox
04:51 - suddenly is in contact with the level
04:52 - and things go a bit crazy popping us up
04:55 - through the level out of the ceiling
04:56 - above
04:58 - what we really want to do here is
04:59 - prevent us standing up again when there
05:01 - is no room to do so
05:03 - come back into the define handle keys
05:05 - jump crouch script
05:07 - here is when we handled the crouch key
05:09 - press and here is where we get back up
05:11 - again by setting the player action to
05:13 - the empty value
05:14 - we are going to need to do a little bit
05:16 - more work before we allow mary to stand
05:18 - up
05:19 - so i think it best we create a new
05:20 - custom block naming it handle get up
05:27 - we'll switch it around to now use this
05:30 - in place of the set player action
05:36 - there okay so at this point mario will
05:39 - have got up we should take this
05:41 - opportunity to check whether we are
05:43 - colliding with anything but remember
05:44 - that checking for collisions will also
05:46 - move mario out of the collision so let's
05:48 - keep track of their current position in
05:50 - the orig y variable first so that we can
05:53 - restore it afterwards orig y stands for
05:56 - original y so the original position
05:58 - set of y to y
06:01 - now we use fixed collisions in direction
06:03 - dx of 0 and dy of 1 as our head is
06:06 - moving upwards
06:08 - we can then check if we bumped our head
06:10 - if solid is greater than 0
06:13 - right
06:14 - so if we did bump our head then this is
06:17 - no good we need to crouch back down
06:19 - quickly
06:20 - set player action back to crouch
06:23 - and remember to restore our y position
06:25 - back to orig y so that we stay where we
06:28 - were
06:33 - now before this will work and there is
06:35 - another fix we must make come with me up
06:37 - to the define handle keys left right
06:40 - script
06:41 - look here we are setting player action
06:43 - to walk right at the top this is no good
06:46 - because this undos our good work of
06:48 - keeping the crouch action set
06:51 - this needs to change a little to account
06:53 - for crouching too
06:54 - add an if else block right at the top
06:57 - and check if player action equals crouch
07:03 - the rest of the scripts can be placed
07:04 - into the else below
07:06 - nice let's run the project and check
07:08 - that out
07:10 - okay this is interesting
07:13 - now when i slide underneath i can no
07:15 - longer get up
07:17 - but i also continue to slide all the way
07:19 - through and can not stop ha
07:22 - we need to begin by making mario slow
07:25 - down when he's crouching
07:26 - first we'll check whether they are
07:28 - moving at all if the absolute value
07:32 - that's the abs abs of speed x is greater
07:35 - than 0.4
07:37 - that means the speed is greater than 0.4
07:40 - or less than minus 0.4
07:43 - then we want to slow down by 0.4 towards
07:47 - zero
07:48 - we could do that with an if else let's
07:51 - do it with maths change speed x by
07:54 - negative 0.4
07:56 - multiplied by
07:59 - speed x divided by and then the same abs
08:02 - of speed x
08:03 - there dividing a number by the absolute
08:06 - value of itself will result in either a
08:09 - one or a minus one if the number was
08:11 - negative
08:13 - quite a useful thing to remember
08:14 - that means speed x will be changed by
08:17 - either minus 0.4 or 0.4 after the
08:20 - multiply slowing the player down
08:23 - next add a make skid smoke for extra
08:26 - effect
08:27 - now in the else we can ensure we are now
08:31 - stationary by setting speed x to zero
08:33 - and setting player frame to zero two to
08:35 - keep the animations in check
08:38 - i'm testing this now
08:41 - oh yeah so crouching is now looking much
08:44 - more cool and i slide to a stop and i
08:47 - have particle smoke
08:49 - of course there is then one question
08:51 - remaining what happens if i slide under
08:55 - ah yes just what i was wondering
08:58 - as i'm crouching and cannot move and i
09:01 - cannot get up
09:02 - i am so stuck oh no
09:05 - yeah well we have three options here we
09:08 - say too bad and lose the player alive
09:11 - but that would be cruel we could keep
09:14 - the player sliding like we did
09:16 - previously so they always make it out
09:17 - the other side
09:19 - that would be okay
09:20 - but it wouldn't make any of these
09:22 - sliding obstacles a challenge so the
09:24 - third option the one we will take is
09:26 - that we will force the player back out
09:28 - the way they came
09:31 - find the define handle get up script
09:34 - when the player is trying to get up but
09:36 - their head is colliding that's here we
09:39 - will change their speed x by direction
09:42 - that will be 90 or minus 90 depending
09:44 - which way they are facing
09:46 - then we can divide that by minus 200. i
09:49 - just picked a good value here by trial
09:51 - and error
09:52 - negative so that they move backwards
09:54 - from under the block
09:56 - come on then let's give it a test
09:58 - i'll slide under the first block oh yes
10:00 - did you see that it was subtle but mario
10:03 - definitely slid back out i'll take a
10:05 - longer run up
10:06 - yeah there you go you can see it working
10:09 - in all its glory there as we slid right
10:11 - back out excellent work
10:14 - and dare i say it we are done for this
10:16 - short episode i hope you enjoyed it and
10:19 - if so then please do hit the like button
10:21 - i'll keep trying to get the tutorials
10:22 - out over the holiday season so do
