00:02 - hi this is Griff patch I'm really
00:04 - excited that you're listening to this um
00:06 - not really sure what I'm doing at the
00:08 - moment but I just wanted to be able to
00:10 - maybe put together some YouTube videos
00:12 - I've often been asked and I don't really
00:15 - have much of a presence on YouTube so uh
00:17 - this is a start not that I'm set up for
00:20 - this I'm at present uh sitting in my
00:22 - kitchen with a with a microphone shoved
00:25 - into a boot to hold it somewhere near my
00:27 - face so it's not the most comfortable of
00:29 - situ ation to be in but I thought I'd
00:31 - give it a go um not really sure what I'm
00:34 - even going to show you but I thought
00:35 - it'd be a good a good way of
00:38 - experimenting and seeing uh whether it
00:40 - actually works uh this screen capture
00:42 - and that so I'm going to create a new
00:45 - project and uh and off we go um I expect
00:48 - in future people might want to ask me uh
00:52 - some questions and maybe I can show show
00:54 - off some things to uh try and answer
00:57 - those questions uh but for now in the
00:59 - lack of any anything more deep I'm just
01:01 - going to have a bit of a play around
01:02 - really um so let's just get uh scratchy
01:06 - to do something interesting um I'm just
01:09 - going to set him up uh to point to the
01:12 - right like he currently is just because
01:14 - I'm pretty sure we going to make him
01:15 - move around it's good to set him back to
01:17 - where he is now I'll stick him on the
01:20 - far left of the
01:21 - screen which is 240 but I'll move it 230
01:24 - that's about right there we go and I'll
01:27 - make him a lot bigger to begin with
01:31 - set size to
01:34 - 200 should do the trick just see that
01:38 - yeah that's great now what I want to do
01:40 - first is have him move in to roughly the
01:42 - middle but I don't want to just have him
01:44 - move straight but uh let's just see um
01:49 - if I do a repeat Loop here I'll just do
01:52 - a forever Loop for now just so we can
01:53 - see them working let's just move him
01:56 - forward um like so let's just see
02:00 - okay so there we go he moves he doesn't
02:02 - stop in the middle and he moves at a
02:04 - pretty straight uh speed very constant
02:08 - when don't want that either so we want
02:10 - him to slow down as he moves so what I'm
02:13 - going to do is introduce a new variable
02:15 - called
02:18 - speed and I'm going to do it for this
02:20 - Sprite only now it's important because I
02:23 - don't want any other clones or Sprites
02:25 - to have access to this varable this is
02:28 - this cat speed only
02:31 - okay I'm going to click off the tick to
02:33 - stop it appearing on the screen I don't
02:34 - want it to be taking up any of the speed
02:37 - a uh the screen space so let's set his
02:40 - speed just here and I'll set it to 10
02:45 - for
02:46 - now
02:47 - and now I will make him move by speed so
02:53 - that will do the same at the moment no
02:54 - difference he's moving by
02:57 - speed so I'm going to Al Al to the speed
03:00 - as he moves so I'm going to set his
03:04 - speed
03:07 - to what his current speed is multiplied
03:10 - by now slightly less than one so that
03:16 - every time it goes around this Loop
03:17 - speed will get smaller and smaller so if
03:20 - I run that
03:21 - now there we go simple as that he now
03:26 - moves forward and speed gets smaller and
03:28 - small in fact we put speed back on again
03:30 - you'll see
03:32 - speed slowly gets down to zero point
03:34 - very very small doesn't move at all so
03:37 - that's
03:38 - good
03:41 - excellent now what I was thinking of
03:43 - doing in this demo uh is doing maybe a
03:46 - bit of cloning so that I could click on
03:49 - that cat and little versions of him
03:52 - would spin off different
03:54 - directions so let's give that a
03:57 - go so let's let's have uh when this
04:00 - Sprite is
04:02 - clicked now what we're going to do in
04:04 - here is
04:06 - create three cats from the one cat so
04:09 - that means I'm to create two clones and
04:13 - leave the one that we already
04:15 - have so to do that we'll need a repeat
04:18 - block now remember that's two
04:21 - clones so we'll have repeat
04:23 - two and we will create a clone of
04:27 - ourselves that's great
04:30 - what else do I want to
04:32 - do um I want to
04:36 - turn and we'll
04:38 - turn uh after we
04:41 - clone and we'll turn by 120 since we're
04:45 - doing three cats so
04:48 - 320s is 360 which is a full circle fact
04:51 - if we just click him now we go three
04:54 - cats so that's great that's done what we
04:56 - wanted
04:58 - and that'll happen every
05:04 - time the last one still moves on great
05:07 - so now you can see why I put in the
05:09 - point Direction 90Â° at the beginning
05:11 - when we click the flag so otherwise we'd
05:13 - be pointing in this space strange
05:14 - Direction so we always start from the
05:16 - same beginning that's
05:19 - great so we've got three cats in three
05:22 - directions what I wanted them to do was
05:24 - to move off in the different directions
05:27 - just like the first cat moved so for
05:30 - this we currently have one forever loop
05:33 - on the one cat that starts out but not
05:36 - on these new
05:37 - clones so what we can do is we can
05:39 - create a custom
05:41 - block called move
05:45 - cat caps locks there that's
05:50 - better okay and we'll take
05:54 - this bit here setting the speed and the
05:57 - loop from the main
06:00 - green flag into my move cat and
06:03 - replace it there with move cat and that
06:05 - will now do the same as it always did so
06:07 - now that click flag is doing this move
06:10 - cat but what I want to do is have each
06:13 - of these clones also call the move cat
06:16 - so I can move this down to a new block
06:19 - hold on what I should have done is put a
06:24 - when there we go when I start as a clone
06:26 - so each of the
06:28 - Clones will also call in to move cat so
06:32 - let's just run that
06:33 - again if I click
06:37 - him there now the two clones that were
06:42 - created zoomed off the one that I
06:44 - already had
06:46 - didn't now why was
06:50 - that what did I need to do that I did
06:52 - not
06:55 - do ah yes I what I did
07:00 - so what I really should be doing for
07:03 - getting this set speed in here let's get
07:05 - rid of
07:06 - that let's set the
07:09 - speed one in
07:12 - here like that so the very first one
07:15 - moves
07:16 - but I'm just going to duplicate that get
07:20 - of that move cap I want to set the speed
07:23 - over here where where do I want it here
07:27 - so when here this the first cat is
07:31 - clicked I'm going to set the speed of
07:33 - the new cat sorry the cat that's clicked
07:35 - to start him going off again and also
07:38 - the ones that are cloned will move at
07:41 - the same speed as
07:43 - well that is right I have got that right
07:46 - good right so let's just try 10 for now
07:47 - that's fine let's do
07:51 - that there we go and I click him again
07:55 - and I click him again and again and
07:58 - again and again and again and they just
08:00 - keep splitting that's crazy but of
08:03 - course when things split they should get
08:05 - smaller shouldn't they obviously so
08:06 - let's make him go smaller when he splits
08:10 - so in looks set size here we
08:15 - go
08:16 - so I should do it again in here so I set
08:19 - the speed and I want to set the size now
08:21 - his size I want him to be half the size
08:23 - he originally was so I'm going to divide
08:25 - his
08:27 - size if we go into looks again we can
08:29 - have the size block so set size to the
08:33 - current size divided by two that's half
08:36 - the
08:36 - size try that again then so click there
08:40 - we
08:41 - go nice only problem is he doesn't half
08:45 - move fast when he's little you'd expect
08:48 - his speed to be like relative to his
08:50 - size really wouldn't you so let's make
08:53 - it so that his speed is relative to his
08:56 - size so when we're setting speed to 10
08:58 - here let's change that
09:00 - what we shall do
09:03 - instead set his speed to be now we can
09:06 - choose set it to I'll just duplicate
09:09 - size there set his speed to the size
09:13 - divided by something and uh Let's do
09:19 - let's try 15 in
09:21 - there so
09:26 - click
09:28 - click
09:30 - click this is
09:34 - better apart from they moved a bit too
09:36 - far out tell you what I'll do rather
09:38 - than setting the
09:40 - speed and then setting the size I'll set
09:44 - the size so it gets smaller first
09:46 - because then his speed is relative to
09:48 - the size he's now become rather than the
09:50 - size he was try that
09:53 - again ah this is
09:57 - good look at that
10:02 - see what this is doing this is quite
10:05 - interesting if I keep clicking
10:08 - them is actually
10:10 - creating this quite interesting
10:13 - pattern
10:15 - and what this is interesting is because
10:18 - it's actually um it's actually very
10:21 - similar to a fractal pattern well it's a
10:24 - pattern that just keeps going on forever
10:25 - and ever so if you could zoom in you
10:28 - could keep doing this and you'd make a
10:29 - pattern that just you could zoom in and
10:31 - in and in because we keep splitting them
10:33 - and splitting them and splitting them of
10:34 - course scratch will weat it's clone
10:36 - limit before we could do that but it's
10:37 - quite an interesting thing and perhaps
10:39 - it's something we could actually play
10:40 - with um so rather than me having to
10:43 - click these how about we get them to
10:46 - automatically split when they slow down
10:50 - so when I click here and I start off he
10:52 - slows down how about we get him to to
10:55 - pop that point and turn into three cats
10:58 - and we'll see where that goes
11:00 - so that would mean having to get rid of
11:02 - this Sprite clicked and have that occur
11:06 - automatically um when the speed gets
11:08 - slow now the cap is getting slower in
11:11 - this move cap Sprite um sorry custom
11:13 - block so we'll have to put a if in
11:16 - there let's put it in underneath the
11:19 - move and we'll say
11:22 - if the
11:25 - speed is less than um let's say 0.1 so
11:31 - this is getting really slow so less than
11:32 - a pixel so that's quantity gets very
11:36 - slow then ah now we can't do this yet
11:40 - because what we need is this bit of
11:42 - script down here when it's clicked to be
11:44 - again in its own little custom block so
11:45 - we'll get rid of the Sprite clicked
11:47 - we'll create a new block
11:50 - called
11:54 - split okay so this code for splitting
11:57 - the cat into three is is now called
11:59 - split and we can pop the split into this
12:03 - speed over here so when it gets slow
12:05 - it'll call that let's just give that to
12:07 - go if I missed
12:10 - anything oh there we go
12:12 - pop and then they will go and then they
12:16 - will go and there we'll go again and I
12:19 - should think we will oh now it's g a bit
12:22 - crazy because we have run out of clones
12:26 - so now it's kind of dancing actually I
12:28 - quite like it
12:31 - it's quite
12:36 - funky let's see that in uh full
12:39 - screen because then you might be to see
12:41 - the little
12:51 - cats okay at this point that's there
12:54 - that's the bit where it goes
12:56 - wrong so now the Clones are not being
12:59 - created what's happening is it's the one
13:01 - single cat is continuing running and the
13:03 - other clones never get started because
13:05 - scratch is a 301 clone
13:09 - limit often the bane of many programers
13:12 - lives but it's uh there to stop the your
13:14 - computer from overheating from getting
13:17 - too
13:18 - slow right
13:21 - cool you know what might be quite fun is
13:24 - to add a pen Trail to that to be able to
13:26 - see where the cat moves as he splits
13:30 - let's try that should we um
13:33 - so
13:35 - let's start up so we'll clear the screen
13:38 - to begin with so was a good idea and
13:42 - quite often also got idea to stick a pen
13:43 - up at the beginning before we do
13:45 - everything just in case the pen is left
13:47 - down and that would mean that you'd have
13:50 - an extra line drawn from wher the uh
13:52 - scratch cat last was we don't want that
13:55 - so let's do that let's set a nice color
13:59 - maybe a
14:00 - green uh there's a nice green there's a
14:04 - nice
14:05 - green um and then we just have to have a
14:08 - pen down before we start drawing let's
14:11 - just give that go straight
14:16 - away there we go so now we can see each
14:19 - cat drawing its own little
14:22 - line I like
14:27 - that
14:29 - huh this um this fractal triangle it's I
14:33 - think it's called shapin triangle um but
14:37 - I don't think that one dances like this
14:39 - uh that's a bit uh bit more curious but
14:43 - I do like the idea I do love fractals
14:48 - um we could even um May this you could
14:53 - start drawing like it's kind of like
14:54 - like almost like trees don't they these
14:57 - fractals
15:00 - we could make the line a bit thicker on
15:03 - the main branch to begin with and thin
15:05 - out as it goes shouldn't be too
15:07 - difficult um so pen size so let's set
15:11 - the pen size where should I set it I'll
15:14 - put it in here because all the no I
15:19 - won't no I won't where should I put it
15:21 - I'll put an initial pen size in
15:24 - here
15:26 - uh what I'm going to do set it relative
15:30 - to the size of the Sprite so
15:34 - looks size divided
15:37 - by let's go with
15:39 - 50 and I'll do the
15:44 - same in here after I've resized it when
15:47 - I split let's give that a
15:56 - go not sure I did that really thick
16:04 - enough let's try a bit
16:06 - thicker let's try dividing it by 30
16:25 - instead I think we
16:27 - should stop it from doing this dancing
16:30 - to be honest let's get it to be a proper
16:33 - triangle um so to do that we'd have to
16:36 - tell it not to
16:38 - split so if I put an if around
16:45 - here then
16:49 - if
16:50 - size is bigger
16:53 - than let's say it's bigger than 10 so if
16:57 - it size bigger than 10 then it goes
16:59 - ahead and shrinks and splits otherwise
17:02 - it's just going to stop moving because
17:03 - it's going to continue in this little
17:05 - mouse mouse scratch C moving bit when
17:08 - it's got really slow so if I just run
17:11 - that let's
17:14 - see if we have a stable ending
17:21 - condition and I think one more split it
17:23 - shouldn't
17:25 - stop hey there we go lots and lots of
17:28 - little
17:29 - cats that was quite fun I should think
17:32 - uh you could probably have a lot of fun
17:34 - with this just uh playing around with it
17:36 - maybe it needs a much darker background
17:38 - let's try black
17:42 - oh I like that quite as much as I
17:44 - thought I was going to maybe uh bit of a
17:47 - gradient
17:48 - there let's just see that's nice like
17:52 - he's drawing a nice
17:57 - Leaf but it's c isn't it there you are
17:59 - simple little cloning sample and we've
18:02 - ended up with Shin's
18:05 - Triangle Well I think that's probably
18:07 - enough for this sorry about my waffling
18:09 - let me know what you think and maybe
18:11 - I'll uh create some some bit more in
18:14 - depth tutorials and hopefully a little
18:16 - bit less waffly but apologies for my
18:19 - waffling scratch
18:22 - on

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Griff patch I'm really excited that you're listening to this um not really sure what I'm doing at the moment but I just wanted to be able to maybe put together some YouTube videos I've often been asked and I don't really have much of a presence on YouTube so uh this is a start not that I'm set up for this I'm at present uh sitting in my kitchen with a with a microphone shoved into a boot to hold it somewhere near my face so it's not the most comfortable of situ ation to be in but I thought I'd give it a go um not really sure what I'm even going to show you but I thought it'd be a good a good way of experimenting and seeing uh whether it actually works uh this screen capture and that so I'm going to create a new project and uh and off we go um I expect in future people might want to ask me uh some questions and maybe I can show show off some things to uh try and answer those questions uh but for now in the lack of any anything more deep I'm just going to have a bit of a play around really um so let's just get uh scratchy to do something interesting um I'm just going to set him up uh to point to the right like he currently is just because I'm pretty sure we going to make him move around it's good to set him back to where he is now I'll stick him on the far left of the screen which is 240 but I'll move it 230 that's about right there we go and I'll make him a lot bigger to begin with set size to 200 should do the trick just see that yeah that's great now what I want to do first is have him move in to roughly the middle but I don't want to just have him move straight but uh let's just see um if I do a repeat Loop here I'll just do a forever Loop for now just so we can see them working let's just move him forward um like so let's just see okay so there we go he moves he doesn't stop in the middle and he moves at a pretty straight uh speed very constant when don't want that either so we want him to slow down as he moves so what I'm going to do is introduce a new variable called speed and I'm going to do it for this Sprite only now it's important because I don't want any other clones or Sprites to have access to this varable this is this cat speed only okay I'm going to click off the tick to stop it appearing on the screen I don't want it to be taking up any of the speed a uh the screen space so let's set his speed just here and I'll set it to 10 for now and now I will make him move by speed so that will do the same at the moment no difference he's moving by speed so I'm going to Al Al to the speed as he moves so I'm going to set his speed to what his current speed is multiplied by now slightly less than one so that every time it goes around this Loop speed will get smaller and smaller so if I run that now there we go simple as that he now moves forward and speed gets smaller and small in fact we put speed back on again you'll see speed slowly gets down to zero point very very small doesn't move at all so that's good excellent now what I was thinking of doing in this demo uh is doing maybe a bit of cloning so that I could click on that cat and little versions of him would spin off different directions so let's give that a go so let's let's have uh when this Sprite is clicked now what we're going to do in here is create three cats from the one cat so that means I'm to create two clones and leave the one that we already have so to do that we'll need a repeat block now remember that's two clones so we'll have repeat two and we will create a clone of ourselves that's great what else do I want to do um I want to turn and we'll turn uh after we clone and we'll turn by 120 since we're doing three cats so 320s is 360 which is a full circle fact if we just click him now we go three cats so that's great that's done what we wanted and that'll happen every time the last one still moves on great so now you can see why I put in the point Direction 90Â° at the beginning when we click the flag so otherwise we'd be pointing in this space strange Direction so we always start from the same beginning that's great so we've got three cats in three directions what I wanted them to do was to move off in the different directions just like the first cat moved so for this we currently have one forever loop on the one cat that starts out but not on these new clones so what we can do is we can create a custom block called move cat caps locks there that's better okay and we'll take this bit here setting the speed and the loop from the main green flag into my move cat and replace it there with move cat and that will now do the same as it always did so now that click flag is doing this move cat but what I want to do is have each of these clones also call the move cat so I can move this down to a new block hold on what I should have done is put a when there we go when I start as a clone so each of the Clones will also call in to move cat so let's just run that again if I click him there now the two clones that were created zoomed off the one that I already had didn't now why was that what did I need to do that I did not do ah yes I what I did so what I really should be doing for getting this set speed in here let's get rid of that let's set the speed one in here like that so the very first one moves but I'm just going to duplicate that get of that move cap I want to set the speed over here where where do I want it here so when here this the first cat is clicked I'm going to set the speed of the new cat sorry the cat that's clicked to start him going off again and also the ones that are cloned will move at the same speed as well that is right I have got that right good right so let's just try 10 for now that's fine let's do that there we go and I click him again and I click him again and again and again and again and again and they just keep splitting that's crazy but of course when things split they should get smaller shouldn't they obviously so let's make him go smaller when he splits so in looks set size here we go so I should do it again in here so I set the speed and I want to set the size now his size I want him to be half the size he originally was so I'm going to divide his size if we go into looks again we can have the size block so set size to the current size divided by two that's half the size try that again then so click there we go nice only problem is he doesn't half move fast when he's little you'd expect his speed to be like relative to his size really wouldn't you so let's make it so that his speed is relative to his size so when we're setting speed to 10 here let's change that what we shall do instead set his speed to be now we can choose set it to I'll just duplicate size there set his speed to the size divided by something and uh Let's do let's try 15 in there so click click click this is better apart from they moved a bit too far out tell you what I'll do rather than setting the speed and then setting the size I'll set the size so it gets smaller first because then his speed is relative to the size he's now become rather than the size he was try that again ah this is good look at that see what this is doing this is quite interesting if I keep clicking them is actually creating this quite interesting pattern and what this is interesting is because it's actually um it's actually very similar to a fractal pattern well it's a pattern that just keeps going on forever and ever so if you could zoom in you could keep doing this and you'd make a pattern that just you could zoom in and in and in because we keep splitting them and splitting them and splitting them of course scratch will weat it's clone limit before we could do that but it's quite an interesting thing and perhaps it's something we could actually play with um so rather than me having to click these how about we get them to automatically split when they slow down so when I click here and I start off he slows down how about we get him to to pop that point and turn into three cats and we'll see where that goes so that would mean having to get rid of this Sprite clicked and have that occur automatically um when the speed gets slow now the cap is getting slower in this move cap Sprite um sorry custom block so we'll have to put a if in there let's put it in underneath the move and we'll say if the speed is less than um let's say 0.1 so this is getting really slow so less than a pixel so that's quantity gets very slow then ah now we can't do this yet because what we need is this bit of script down here when it's clicked to be again in its own little custom block so we'll get rid of the Sprite clicked we'll create a new block called split okay so this code for splitting the cat into three is is now called split and we can pop the split into this speed over here so when it gets slow it'll call that let's just give that to go if I missed anything oh there we go pop and then they will go and then they will go and there we'll go again and I should think we will oh now it's g a bit crazy because we have run out of clones so now it's kind of dancing actually I quite like it it's quite funky let's see that in uh full screen because then you might be to see the little cats okay at this point that's there that's the bit where it goes wrong so now the Clones are not being created what's happening is it's the one single cat is continuing running and the other clones never get started because scratch is a 301 clone limit often the bane of many programers lives but it's uh there to stop the your computer from overheating from getting too slow right cool you know what might be quite fun is to add a pen Trail to that to be able to see where the cat moves as he splits let's try that should we um so let's start up so we'll clear the screen to begin with so was a good idea and quite often also got idea to stick a pen up at the beginning before we do everything just in case the pen is left down and that would mean that you'd have an extra line drawn from wher the uh scratch cat last was we don't want that so let's do that let's set a nice color maybe a green uh there's a nice green there's a nice green um and then we just have to have a pen down before we start drawing let's just give that go straight away there we go so now we can see each cat drawing its own little line I like that huh this um this fractal triangle it's I think it's called shapin triangle um but I don't think that one dances like this uh that's a bit uh bit more curious but I do like the idea I do love fractals um we could even um May this you could start drawing like it's kind of like like almost like trees don't they these fractals we could make the line a bit thicker on the main branch to begin with and thin out as it goes shouldn't be too difficult um so pen size so let's set the pen size where should I set it I'll put it in here because all the no I won't no I won't where should I put it I'll put an initial pen size in here uh what I'm going to do set it relative to the size of the Sprite so looks size divided by let's go with 50 and I'll do the same in here after I've resized it when I split let's give that a go not sure I did that really thick enough let's try a bit thicker let's try dividing it by 30 instead I think we should stop it from doing this dancing to be honest let's get it to be a proper triangle um so to do that we'd have to tell it not to split so if I put an if around here then if size is bigger than let's say it's bigger than 10 so if it size bigger than 10 then it goes ahead and shrinks and splits otherwise it's just going to stop moving because it's going to continue in this little mouse mouse scratch C moving bit when it's got really slow so if I just run that let's see if we have a stable ending condition and I think one more split it shouldn't stop hey there we go lots and lots of little cats that was quite fun I should think uh you could probably have a lot of fun with this just uh playing around with it maybe it needs a much darker background let's try black oh I like that quite as much as I thought I was going to maybe uh bit of a gradient there let's just see that's nice like he's drawing a nice Leaf but it's c isn't it there you are simple little cloning sample and we've ended up with Shin's Triangle Well I think that's probably enough for this sorry about my waffling let me know what you think and maybe I'll uh create some some bit more in depth tutorials and hopefully a little bit less waffly but apologies for my waffling scratch on
