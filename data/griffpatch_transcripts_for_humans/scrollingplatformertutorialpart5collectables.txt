00:00 - hi and welcome to part 5 of my tutorial
00:02 - how to create a scrolling platformer in
00:04 - scratch today we are going to look at
00:07 - how to add in collectables into this
00:10 - level so before we do that what we need
00:13 - to is my few little tweaks to the
00:14 - platform's
00:15 - sprite because we're gonna make use of
00:17 - this sprite to do the collectables as
00:19 - well so let's have a look what we need
00:22 - to do is make this a little bit more
00:24 - generic that means is we usable really
00:27 - four other things so in the moment we've
00:29 - got this bit of code in here where we
00:30 - repeatedly creating clones for each part
00:33 - of the game so we're going to change
00:35 - that so that we can do it using a custom
00:37 - block instead which will make the code a
00:39 - lot neater so create a new custom block
00:43 - and call it clone at X and then add in
00:50 - using the options and number input call
00:53 - it X and then a text element and say Y
00:57 - codon and add in a favorable number
01:01 - input Y without screen refresh okay now
01:07 - in here we're going to do what we do
01:09 - down here so we can take we can create a
01:10 - clone let me just duplicate that create
01:13 - a clone of myself change X by then now
01:18 - put the X in from there and we want
01:22 - another change or not change underneath
01:25 - change Y by and drag in the Y from there
01:30 - and we've still got the next costume
01:32 - underneath so now we can reuse this
01:35 - rather than writing clone and change
01:36 - next costume we can use this in here so
01:41 - I'll move the clone at two down there
01:45 - another one afterwards and we'll plug in
01:49 - the values that we had in here so we've
01:50 - got 360 for the first Y of 0 and change
01:55 - X by 360 for the second and Y of 0 now
01:59 - replaces all of that there without a
02:01 - little bit there which is much neater
02:03 - slash button that make sure it works yep
02:07 - so the level is still positioned just as
02:09 - it was which is what we wanted
02:11 - that makes it really easy now to add
02:13 - another one underneath for another parts
02:14 - level without having to rewrite this
02:16 - part every time we can just create the
02:18 - next bit of level one up to the other in
02:20 - there while we're here let's also make
02:22 - it a few more changes at the moment when
02:25 - the green flag is clicked we show the
02:27 - platform but that's not what we want now
02:28 - we're going to make it so we hide it at
02:30 - the beginning to make it not flash onto
02:32 - the screen like that okay what we're
02:36 - going to do is we've got this level
02:40 - variable here we're not using this this
02:42 - is supposed to be so which level we're
02:43 - on we're going to be able to show a
02:45 - different level so what we can introduce
02:46 - is a new if-else condition here we're
02:51 - going to pop it just here around the
02:54 - switch black costume and clone and we're
02:58 - going to check that level equals one for
03:01 - this first bit here level equals one so
03:06 - we only create four level one if level
03:09 - bearable equals one so that men freed us
03:12 - up to start doing new things with new
03:13 - levels what we also want to do is add
03:17 - another hide again at the top of here
03:21 - when as soon as we get it set up so that
03:24 - any existing it's a level that visible
03:27 - when we start setting up the level a
03:29 - hidden okay that looks good to me so I
03:33 - think that's what I wanted to do let me
03:34 - just check that works yeah if we died
03:38 - yeah all is good right then so now we
03:43 - can move on to looking at how to add
03:45 - collectibles on collectibles and work
03:47 - very much like platforms for all types
03:49 - of purposes so what we can do is
03:51 - duplicate this platforms right and we go
03:57 - into it click the little I rename it as
04:01 - collectibles so okay now we need a new
04:08 - costume however for this now you could
04:12 - go to my scratch project on my grief
04:14 - attitude to toe account or you can draw
04:17 - your own so we're going to just draw a
04:19 - quick one here in vector mode let's draw
04:23 - a field
04:25 - cool to begin with hold down shift while
04:28 - doing let's do min so we can see what
04:29 - we're doing cuz we can make it quite
04:30 - small hold down shift while you're
04:32 - drawing this let's see how it works make
04:35 - a perfect circle like so and the color
04:40 - of this we go in to click on this little
04:42 - color space thing we want it to be a
04:45 - dark yellow so we click on yellow and
04:48 - then bring down the brightness to say
04:51 - Midway now click on the little white to
04:54 - have the other color and this one wants
04:57 - to be transparent now you select that by
05:00 - clicking back onto the color pallet
05:01 - cooking on this line okay like that now
05:06 - click on the fill tool and the circle
05:09 - tool to fill into a circle this click
05:14 - roughly in the middle so we've got a
05:16 - dark yellow outside and a transparent
05:18 - middle nice now we really want this
05:21 - positioned in the middle of the sprite
05:23 - the moment you see the offset is in the
05:24 - slate offset there so click on the set
05:27 - costviewer Center and find the middle
05:29 - and then release the mouse that it's
05:32 - nicely centered okay now we want a
05:35 - middle circle again so change the circle
05:38 - tool we can change the color to yellow
05:40 - and we're going to draw another circle
05:42 - in the middle of this circle you know
05:47 - reposition it to be in the middle like
05:52 - this
05:52 - and then feel again and this time we're
05:56 - going to go from yellow click on that
05:58 - one to revert to white and you want the
06:02 - same thing so yellow on the outside
06:04 - won't wave out so click here to change
06:06 - around white on the outside yellow in
06:08 - the middle okay that's my collectible so
06:19 - let's call it dot in a costume name back
06:24 - to the scripts so how do we make this
06:26 - work for these new little collectibles
06:29 - it's a little bit more tricky but we
06:30 - it's pretty much the same as the
06:32 - positioning of the level so what we can
06:35 - do is change like this clone at first we
06:37 - need to change
06:38 - what we're going to do is position the
06:40 - little collectible dots all over the
06:42 - level but they need to be exact
06:44 - positions so we're not going to do a
06:45 - change X we're going to do a set X so
06:48 - change this to change X and change wise
06:51 - to be sets and we want set X to be X set
06:58 - Y to be Y and we don't need the next
07:01 - costume either I'll get rid of that so
07:03 - that's our new cone at for this
07:05 - collectible sprite not for the platform
07:07 - one three collectibles and then the
07:09 - positions so from now let's just get rid
07:12 - of the first one let's put in 50 and
07:16 - zero in there just to see if we can get
07:19 - one to appear where it says switch
07:21 - costume to change that to dot mat and
07:26 - anything else we need to do in there I'm
07:28 - not sure let's run it and see what
07:30 - happens all right let's see this is
07:34 - interesting
07:34 - so obviously that is far too big but
07:38 - also there's two of them now why is that
07:40 - well I can tell you that straight away
07:42 - because the way this code is working
07:44 - we're going into setup we're hiding one
07:47 - and then we're setting the position of
07:51 - it then we're calling clone and creating
07:54 - another one so we've got two so what
07:57 - actually happens is the one that we want
07:58 - is the clone but we don't want the
08:00 - original one before the clone we want to
08:03 - hide that in the during the game to fix
08:05 - that what we're going to do is we're
08:07 - going to move this X x and y above the
08:11 - clone so that when we create this clone
08:14 - we're going to be positioning it to
08:16 - where we want it to be and then create
08:18 - the clone so that clones is at that
08:21 - position and then we're going to add in
08:23 - a set X at the very bottom and I didn't
08:28 - - nein nein nein nein nein to be far off
08:30 - the screen so we've created one clone
08:32 - and that is what we wanted and the one
08:34 - that's that the original supply that we
08:36 - positioned is then moved off screen off
08:39 - level or not let's see again so if you
08:41 - run it now there we go you know one
08:43 - sprite at fifty by zero and the other
08:47 - ones hidden so if we clone
08:50 - second one at 100 by 50 were not again
08:56 - there we go there we've got two so
09:00 - that's great we can now create
09:02 - collectibles anywhere on ever we want
09:05 - the biggest problem is actually knowing
09:06 - where to put them because it can be hard
09:08 - to position them nicely on this level
09:10 - just my guesswork so what we can do is
09:13 - make the job a little bit easier just
09:16 - before we do that let me just shrink
09:17 - down this costume because it's too big
09:19 - so I'll just slipped all of that and
09:22 - shrink it down reposition it back in the
09:27 - middle just try that again that's much
09:30 - better
09:31 - okay so what we're going to do is there
09:34 - a little bit of scripting just to be
09:35 - able to show we're on the level that we
09:37 - want to position things so move to the
09:39 - stage and we're going to add in a new
09:44 - global variable for all sprites so all
09:48 - uppercase so we can tell it's a global
09:50 - sprite and we're going to call this
09:53 - Mouse like that click okay okay
10:02 - malleable and now add in an event when
10:06 - key pressed and we'll have em for Mouse
10:11 - that and we're going to set Mouse when M
10:17 - is pressed to B now this is a little bit
10:19 - complicated but it's a join from the
10:23 - operators block that joins two words
10:25 - together and we're going to join
10:27 - together more joints so we need another
10:30 - join into the second half like that and
10:36 - in the middle join we're gonna put comma
10:40 - and a space then we need a plus in the
10:44 - left hand side of the join and we're
10:46 - going to put mouse x + scroll X and in
10:55 - the right hand side where the world is
10:58 - written we're going to right mouse why
11:02 - Plus scroll I like that so when the M
11:07 - button key is pressed in the keyboard in
11:09 - a set its Mouse variable to the current
11:12 - position of the mouse offset by the
11:14 - scroll with a comma and a space and then
11:17 - the mouse Y and the scroll way so have a
11:20 - look what that does I run the project so
11:22 - I put the mouse over that first
11:24 - collectible of this M see how the mouse
11:28 - is now fifty by zero that's exactly
11:30 - where we put this collectable isn't it
11:31 - fifty by zero if we look at the
11:32 - collectables there we are
11:34 - I look at where the second one is press
11:36 - M 151 151 one off but that's because I
11:43 - moved them out slightly offset but now
11:45 - if I put the mouse and press M this will
11:48 - tell me where I need to put the X and
11:50 - the y to make it a collectible there so
11:53 - if I was to move across over here
11:54 - I wanted a collectible over here I just
11:56 - put my mouse there press M it says 363
12:01 - by 63 so let's duplicate one of these
12:04 - typing those numbers 363 by 63 and run
12:10 - it again and see there we go I collect
12:14 - all this know exactly where I told it to
12:15 - be and I can do that all over the place
12:17 - so I could have one just here over the
12:20 - top of the water so if I press M here
12:24 - hello my new one and type in seven to
12:28 - one by 71 but net there it is and I want
12:35 - one right above that one say as well so
12:37 - say there same again duplicate my clone
12:42 - seven I'll do the same X but the value
12:45 - of hundred and thirty in my why not
12:49 - again
12:51 - well you are so that's a really useful
12:54 - little feature to be able to find
12:55 - positions where you want to place your
12:57 - collectibles so the next thing you hide
13:00 - that Mouse is my own and showing the
13:02 - mouse there like that next thing you
13:04 - could do you might find useful if you're
13:06 - going to the stage and just set mouse is
13:08 - to add in a show variable just there
13:10 - show variable Mouse that way when you've
13:12 - hidden it you press end the next time up
13:15 - it pops even
13:16 - even if it wasn't visible because you
13:19 - hit it right that's great
13:20 - so anything left for this tutorial is to
13:24 - be able to collect these little circles
13:26 - which will be fun so let's stop this go
13:30 - into the collectables sprite and now
13:33 - this is going to be in the tick script
13:37 - this one here so we've got a tick here
13:38 - where we're positioning the collectible
13:41 - we may want to have a check to see
13:42 - whether we've touched the collectible in
13:44 - here
13:45 - so put in an if condition in there that
13:48 - and put in a if touching player like
13:56 - that then what we want to do is control
14:00 - delete this clone okay let's run that
14:04 - see if this works
14:06 - there we go now we are able to collect
14:10 - these clones these collectibles that was
14:15 - easy wasn't it so what if you want to
14:17 - have a little number on the screen
14:19 - showing you how many that you've
14:20 - collected right for that let's add in a
14:24 - new variable for all sprites so it's
14:29 - going to be uppercase call it collect it
14:32 - like that and click OK there for now
14:39 - and set collected in the setup set it to
14:48 - zero because we've not let any at the
14:50 - start of the level and then every time
14:53 - we have a touching player
14:55 - we want to change collected by one
15:01 - before we delete it now if you run that
15:04 - again every time we collect one
15:08 - collected goes up by one and if we die
15:13 - clicked it goes back to zero and they
15:15 - collect order the glam again hey well
15:20 - okay
15:21 - and that's it for this tutorial next
15:24 - tutorial we shall look at adding
15:26 - end-of-level so I hope you enjoyed that
15:30 - and come back next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi and welcome to part 5 of my tutorial how to create a scrolling platformer in scratch today we are going to look at how to add in collectables into this level so before we do that what we need to is my few little tweaks to the platform's sprite because we're gonna make use of this sprite to do the collectables as well so let's have a look what we need to do is make this a little bit more generic that means is we usable really four other things so in the moment we've got this bit of code in here where we repeatedly creating clones for each part of the game so we're going to change that so that we can do it using a custom block instead which will make the code a lot neater so create a new custom block and call it clone at X and then add in using the options and number input call it X and then a text element and say Y codon and add in a favorable number input Y without screen refresh okay now in here we're going to do what we do down here so we can take we can create a clone let me just duplicate that create a clone of myself change X by then now put the X in from there and we want another change or not change underneath change Y by and drag in the Y from there and we've still got the next costume underneath so now we can reuse this rather than writing clone and change next costume we can use this in here so I'll move the clone at two down there another one afterwards and we'll plug in the values that we had in here so we've got 360 for the first Y of 0 and change X by 360 for the second and Y of 0 now replaces all of that there without a little bit there which is much neater slash button that make sure it works yep so the level is still positioned just as it was which is what we wanted that makes it really easy now to add another one underneath for another parts level without having to rewrite this part every time we can just create the next bit of level one up to the other in there while we're here let's also make it a few more changes at the moment when the green flag is clicked we show the platform but that's not what we want now we're going to make it so we hide it at the beginning to make it not flash onto the screen like that okay what we're going to do is we've got this level variable here we're not using this this is supposed to be so which level we're on we're going to be able to show a different level so what we can introduce is a new ifelse condition here we're going to pop it just here around the switch black costume and clone and we're going to check that level equals one for this first bit here level equals one so we only create four level one if level bearable equals one so that men freed us up to start doing new things with new levels what we also want to do is add another hide again at the top of here when as soon as we get it set up so that any existing it's a level that visible when we start setting up the level a hidden okay that looks good to me so I think that's what I wanted to do let me just check that works yeah if we died yeah all is good right then so now we can move on to looking at how to add collectibles on collectibles and work very much like platforms for all types of purposes so what we can do is duplicate this platforms right and we go into it click the little I rename it as collectibles so okay now we need a new costume however for this now you could go to my scratch project on my grief attitude to toe account or you can draw your own so we're going to just draw a quick one here in vector mode let's draw a field cool to begin with hold down shift while doing let's do min so we can see what we're doing cuz we can make it quite small hold down shift while you're drawing this let's see how it works make a perfect circle like so and the color of this we go in to click on this little color space thing we want it to be a dark yellow so we click on yellow and then bring down the brightness to say Midway now click on the little white to have the other color and this one wants to be transparent now you select that by clicking back onto the color pallet cooking on this line okay like that now click on the fill tool and the circle tool to fill into a circle this click roughly in the middle so we've got a dark yellow outside and a transparent middle nice now we really want this positioned in the middle of the sprite the moment you see the offset is in the slate offset there so click on the set costviewer Center and find the middle and then release the mouse that it's nicely centered okay now we want a middle circle again so change the circle tool we can change the color to yellow and we're going to draw another circle in the middle of this circle you know reposition it to be in the middle like this and then feel again and this time we're going to go from yellow click on that one to revert to white and you want the same thing so yellow on the outside won't wave out so click here to change around white on the outside yellow in the middle okay that's my collectible so let's call it dot in a costume name back to the scripts so how do we make this work for these new little collectibles it's a little bit more tricky but we it's pretty much the same as the positioning of the level so what we can do is change like this clone at first we need to change what we're going to do is position the little collectible dots all over the level but they need to be exact positions so we're not going to do a change X we're going to do a set X so change this to change X and change wise to be sets and we want set X to be X set Y to be Y and we don't need the next costume either I'll get rid of that so that's our new cone at for this collectible sprite not for the platform one three collectibles and then the positions so from now let's just get rid of the first one let's put in 50 and zero in there just to see if we can get one to appear where it says switch costume to change that to dot mat and anything else we need to do in there I'm not sure let's run it and see what happens all right let's see this is interesting so obviously that is far too big but also there's two of them now why is that well I can tell you that straight away because the way this code is working we're going into setup we're hiding one and then we're setting the position of it then we're calling clone and creating another one so we've got two so what actually happens is the one that we want is the clone but we don't want the original one before the clone we want to hide that in the during the game to fix that what we're going to do is we're going to move this X x and y above the clone so that when we create this clone we're going to be positioning it to where we want it to be and then create the clone so that clones is at that position and then we're going to add in a set X at the very bottom and I didn't nein nein nein nein nein to be far off the screen so we've created one clone and that is what we wanted and the one that's that the original supply that we positioned is then moved off screen off level or not let's see again so if you run it now there we go you know one sprite at fifty by zero and the other ones hidden so if we clone second one at 100 by 50 were not again there we go there we've got two so that's great we can now create collectibles anywhere on ever we want the biggest problem is actually knowing where to put them because it can be hard to position them nicely on this level just my guesswork so what we can do is make the job a little bit easier just before we do that let me just shrink down this costume because it's too big so I'll just slipped all of that and shrink it down reposition it back in the middle just try that again that's much better okay so what we're going to do is there a little bit of scripting just to be able to show we're on the level that we want to position things so move to the stage and we're going to add in a new global variable for all sprites so all uppercase so we can tell it's a global sprite and we're going to call this Mouse like that click okay okay malleable and now add in an event when key pressed and we'll have em for Mouse that and we're going to set Mouse when M is pressed to B now this is a little bit complicated but it's a join from the operators block that joins two words together and we're going to join together more joints so we need another join into the second half like that and in the middle join we're gonna put comma and a space then we need a plus in the left hand side of the join and we're going to put mouse x + scroll X and in the right hand side where the world is written we're going to right mouse why Plus scroll I like that so when the M button key is pressed in the keyboard in a set its Mouse variable to the current position of the mouse offset by the scroll with a comma and a space and then the mouse Y and the scroll way so have a look what that does I run the project so I put the mouse over that first collectible of this M see how the mouse is now fifty by zero that's exactly where we put this collectable isn't it fifty by zero if we look at the collectables there we are I look at where the second one is press M 151 151 one off but that's because I moved them out slightly offset but now if I put the mouse and press M this will tell me where I need to put the X and the y to make it a collectible there so if I was to move across over here I wanted a collectible over here I just put my mouse there press M it says 363 by 63 so let's duplicate one of these typing those numbers 363 by 63 and run it again and see there we go I collect all this know exactly where I told it to be and I can do that all over the place so I could have one just here over the top of the water so if I press M here hello my new one and type in seven to one by 71 but net there it is and I want one right above that one say as well so say there same again duplicate my clone seven I'll do the same X but the value of hundred and thirty in my why not again well you are so that's a really useful little feature to be able to find positions where you want to place your collectibles so the next thing you hide that Mouse is my own and showing the mouse there like that next thing you could do you might find useful if you're going to the stage and just set mouse is to add in a show variable just there show variable Mouse that way when you've hidden it you press end the next time up it pops even even if it wasn't visible because you hit it right that's great so anything left for this tutorial is to be able to collect these little circles which will be fun so let's stop this go into the collectables sprite and now this is going to be in the tick script this one here so we've got a tick here where we're positioning the collectible we may want to have a check to see whether we've touched the collectible in here so put in an if condition in there that and put in a if touching player like that then what we want to do is control delete this clone okay let's run that see if this works there we go now we are able to collect these clones these collectibles that was easy wasn't it so what if you want to have a little number on the screen showing you how many that you've collected right for that let's add in a new variable for all sprites so it's going to be uppercase call it collect it like that and click OK there for now and set collected in the setup set it to zero because we've not let any at the start of the level and then every time we have a touching player we want to change collected by one before we delete it now if you run that again every time we collect one collected goes up by one and if we die clicked it goes back to zero and they collect order the glam again hey well okay and that's it for this tutorial next tutorial we shall look at adding endoflevel so I hope you enjoyed that and come back next time bye
