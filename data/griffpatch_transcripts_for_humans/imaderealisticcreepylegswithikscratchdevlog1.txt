00:03 - scratchers trying out new ideas for
00:06 - Scratch projects is a whole lot of fun
00:08 - and right now I'm playing with
00:10 - simulating a multi-legged creature using
00:12 - inverse kinesmatics yes it's Spidey cat
00:15 - ain't they the cutest and since I'm
00:18 - right here at the start of the process I
00:21 - thought it'd be fun to share it with you
00:23 - all and make this into a devlog I'm not
00:26 - even sure what kind of game this will be
00:27 - and nothing you see thus far is set in
00:29 - stone so as you watch and get ideas drop
00:32 - me comments to help influence the game
00:34 - before it finally gets released on
00:36 - scratch exciting stuff so let's rewind
00:40 - just a tad and see just how this project
00:43 - began with a fresh project and not
00:46 - having the heart to delete scratchy
00:48 - completely I kept their head and gave
00:50 - them a new body the legs need to move
00:53 - around so I'll leave them out of this
00:55 - Sprite
00:56 - next for the level I just need it to be
00:59 - filled with interesting platforms for
01:01 - our spider legs to interact with how we
01:04 - actually move the spider I'll also work
01:06 - out later for now they can just follow
01:08 - the mouse pointer
01:10 - so with the scene set we can look at
01:12 - adding our first spider limb just one I
01:16 - want it to reach out from the spider
01:18 - body and attach to any nearby solid wall
01:20 - that it can find easier said than done
01:23 - perhaps I can sweep the area around the
01:25 - player with a fake leg looking for
01:27 - collisions
01:28 - so I drew that fake leg scripted the
01:30 - loop and when touching the level I
01:33 - recorded the direction in a list of
01:34 - possible contacts then we're free to
01:37 - pick any of these that seem best hey you
01:40 - might like this did you know that to
01:42 - pick a random item out of a scratch list
01:45 - you can copy and paste the word random
01:48 - into the item of list block and that
01:51 - actually works how cool is that
01:54 - turning off the run without screen
01:56 - refresh
01:57 - and the leg now points at any wall
01:59 - within its reach and yikes that's quite
02:02 - jiggly lots of possible contacts then
02:04 - obviously all except down here
02:07 - now to make things more stable we would
02:10 - expect the leg to pick a contact point
02:12 - on the wall and then stay with it but
02:15 - for that we need to improve our
02:16 - detection and find the actual point on
02:19 - the fake leg where the wall contact
02:21 - actually occurs for this I will create a
02:24 - smaller second costume and shoot that
02:26 - down the leg until it comes into contact
02:28 - with the level recording that point as
02:31 - Target X and Y then once we've found a
02:34 - Target we position the leg there and
02:37 - then point that back towards the
02:38 - player's body
02:39 - this week and repeat until the player
02:41 - becomes too far away to keep hold and
02:44 - then we'll just need to find another
02:46 - place to hold on to
02:48 - and there we go this is far more stable
02:51 - I love how the leg stays attached and
02:53 - now rotates in place
02:55 - I'm less Keen though on how the leg
02:57 - extends through spider cat's body to fix
03:01 - this then we'll need to give the spider
03:03 - leg a knee joint
03:05 - this allows the body to move right up
03:07 - close to the foot and the leg bends to
03:10 - accommodate this is so cool and it's
03:13 - called inverse kinematics
03:15 - it sounds dead hard but in reality it's
03:18 - just a little math so here's spider cat
03:20 - and here is their foot we know the leg
03:23 - is made of two parts if they are the
03:26 - same length then this will make the math
03:28 - a little easier so the first half of the
03:31 - leg can be swung freely around spidey's
03:33 - body forming a circle
03:35 - and the other half we want to be
03:37 - touching the contact point so again you
03:40 - can swing around there making a second
03:42 - Circle
03:43 - and this is interesting can you see
03:46 - where the two circles intersect that is
03:48 - where they cross over well that is the
03:50 - point that we need to draw our legs knee
03:53 - brilliant so is there some math we can
03:56 - use to calculate this point well of
03:58 - course it's just some simple
04:00 - trigonometry for this right angled
04:02 - triangle we know the length of half a
04:05 - leg is 40 pixels and we can get the
04:07 - distance of the contact point to the
04:09 - player using the distance 2 block and
04:11 - divide it by two
04:12 - trigonometry tells us that angle is
04:15 - equal to Arc cause acos of the adjacent
04:18 - divided by the hypotenuse
04:21 - perfect we can plug that into our code
04:23 - but first i'm going to switch to using
04:26 - pen so that I can easily draw both
04:28 - halves of a leg without having to use
04:30 - two Sprites or clones
04:33 - oh
04:35 - here it is with a simple line in pen
04:38 - without a knee looks cool but you wait
04:41 - until I add the ik inverse kinesmatics
04:44 - to prove it works I'll pop a circle
04:46 - around the player and the contact point
04:48 - where they cross is where I expect the
04:51 - knee to flex we want the distance from
04:53 - the contact to the player and then we'll
04:56 - calculate the angle to the knee using
04:59 - that acos or a sign as I did here whoops
05:02 - now I'll have to do a subtract from 90
05:04 - to make up for it next we move forward
05:06 - towards the knee and let's give that a
05:10 - test
05:11 - oh guys guys look at this that's some
05:14 - beautiful articulation and do you see
05:16 - how it's matching the expected circles
05:19 - crossover perfectly yeah it's looking
05:21 - quite spider-like over here
05:24 - now I think we are ready to up our game
05:27 - and add in the other seven legs for that
05:29 - I think we'll swap to using clones so
05:32 - the erase block has to go in the main
05:34 - player Sprite and then I'll create the
05:36 - eight clones
05:38 - oh wow this is looking exciting there's
05:42 - a bit of flickering as the legs go out
05:44 - of range I think we can fix that easy
05:46 - enough though I probably shouldn't be
05:48 - doing the trig on numbers that are not
05:50 - valid yeah yeah when out of range don't
05:54 - even try to draw the leg
05:56 - that's better
05:59 - hey isn't it
06:01 - all the legs kind of form a spiral
06:03 - around the cat remember how when we drew
06:06 - the circles to calculate the knee joints
06:08 - well there is always two possible
06:11 - intersections but we are only
06:13 - calculating this one so our knee always
06:17 - bends the same way clockwise
06:20 - we could mess around with that for
06:22 - example when the foot is to the left of
06:24 - the spider make the knee Bend in the
06:26 - opposite direction
06:29 - how does that look
06:32 - cool feels like a cross between a crab
06:36 - and a plasma ball it looks dead cool in
06:38 - certain areas of this level like this
06:40 - vertical shaft
06:42 - I think what I'm going to try and work
06:44 - on next is having the legs transition
06:46 - from one position to another rather than
06:49 - instantly teleporting like they
06:50 - currently do and perhaps assign each leg
06:53 - to a body position to keep the limbs
06:55 - spread around the body and stop them
06:57 - crunching up into one place
06:59 - also now that the legs follow the body
07:01 - we'll have to start thinking how the
07:03 - body should follow the legs if you know
07:05 - what I mean after all the body should be
07:08 - being supported by the legs
07:10 - hey and I've had some great news you
07:13 - guys must know Crystal keeper 7 right
07:15 - well he's amazing at game art and it
07:17 - looks like we might even get a collab up
07:19 - and running here now that would be
07:22 - awesome go and take a look at his
07:23 - YouTube channel and scratch account and
07:25 - you'll see why I'm excited can you
07:27 - imagine what this game would become in
07:30 - fact don't just think about it post your
07:32 - comments under the video and take a look
07:33 - at what other people are saying and vote
07:35 - them up I think there's a heap of
07:37 - potential and I'd love to try some of
07:39 - the best ideas if you wouldn't mind
07:42 - smashing that like button on this video
07:44 - to get things rolling then I'd
07:45 - appreciate that and do subscribe to the
07:47 - channel and make sure to click the Bell
07:49 - icon so you get notified when the next
07:51 - video drops for those who want to
07:53 - support the channel further we have a

07:59 - special thanks to my channel patrons
08:02 - emperoras55 Minecraft Bernardo C Thor
08:06 - scratcher and scratch Logan you guys
08:09 - rock well thank you for watching that's
08:12 - all I've got time for today have a great
08:15 - week ahead and scratch on guys
