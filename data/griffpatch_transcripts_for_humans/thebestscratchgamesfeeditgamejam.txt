00:52 - fire with oil before the drops can

01:07 - White Rabbit feeding our faces with
01:09 - carrots I love how very rabbity our
01:11 - movements are but watch out for the

01:16 - gosh once you reach full carrot your
01:18 - fearsome carrot breath is
01:20 - Unleashed I can't tell you how
01:22 - entertaining this combo is and you even
01:24 - have a more tricky night cycle to deal
01:26 - with where it becomes very tricky to see
01:28 - that Hunter just how long can you
01:31 - survive the black tiger 7 sneaks into
01:34 - the arcade category with this little gem
01:36 - named feed the cat the trick is to keep
01:39 - their hunger bar topped up while making
01:41 - sure not to eat anything that would
01:43 - disagree with scratchy's rather delicate
01:45 - tummy it starts pretty easy eat the
01:47 - burgers carrots tacos as they fly across
01:49 - the conveyor belt but the speed ramps up
01:51 - quickly and then things get out of
01:54 - control it's a brilliant game that keeps
01:56 - you coming back for more and last but
01:59 - not least Feed Me by just a lemon dude
02:02 - and you can tell from the title screen
02:04 - that this game means business and it
02:07 - does you play this little dude facing
02:09 - off against an unending onslaught of
02:11 - wacky mutations armed with only well a
02:14 - rather awesome rapid firing Cannon which
02:17 - is lucky because you need it the fact
02:20 - that we are feeding these enemies of
02:21 - bullets is made plain when the large Ms
02:24 - burst into the scene I love everything
02:27 - from the great enemies the clean score
02:29 - projected on the ground behind the
02:30 - action and the handrawn Crosshair wow
02:33 - just don't die trying to collect those
02:35 - tempting powerups oh
02:38 - bother so wow each of these games is a
02:41 - blast but the winner is Feed Me by just

02:48 - congratulations considering the
02:49 - competition in this category best
02:52 - Gathering Survival game oh now guys
02:57 - Gathering games these are the games
02:59 - where you must go out to gather
03:00 - resources to complete your mission and
03:03 - oh man have I got the best games to show
03:05 - you it's just a shame only one can win
03:09 - in feed it nuggety 7 has you stranded in
03:12 - a Strange Land where your job is to
03:15 - appease the sleeping Beast by keeping it
03:17 - well fed yeah I guess eats in it sleep
03:20 - and its favorite food is rocks and trees
03:23 - which it just so happens you can pick up
03:25 - in abundance at least to begin with the
03:28 - items get stored in your fast list
03:30 - inventory which means you get to choose
03:32 - when to return to feed the beast
03:34 - preferably before their hunger bar drops
03:36 - too low but don't overfeed them as
03:39 - resources don't grow on trees you know
03:42 - um next up cool Koda 13 presents slime
03:46 - servant in this polished game you need
03:49 - to pick up food scattered randomly
03:51 - throughout the world and bring it to the
03:53 - Slime King but be careful if you run out
03:56 - of energy you will lose so you must eat
03:59 - some of the food yourself only don't let
04:02 - the Slime King see you do it or he won't
04:04 - be happy it's a wonderfully addictive
04:06 - game and I love going back to try and
04:08 - beat my last score I just wish the key
04:11 - for eating food yourself was different
04:12 - to the pickup and give buttons because I
04:14 - kept accidentally eating when I was
04:16 - trying to give to the Slime King and
04:19 - that's game
04:22 - over ah nautical nourishment by word
04:26 - four is for those who like to explore
04:29 - the depths of the ocean initially things
04:31 - look quite simple but the controls and
04:33 - the visuals as you begin to dive deeper
04:36 - really start to draw you in the story is
04:38 - that you need to gather enough
04:40 - underwater resources to cook up some
04:42 - great Seafood to feed all the fish who
04:44 - happen to be swimming all around you
04:46 - most delightfully I'm told using my
04:49 - boids tutorial a great job because it's
04:51 - very well suited to this game wow we can
04:54 - use some of our collected resources to
04:57 - buy upgrades which really helps so we
04:59 - can die deeper and for longer and oh my
05:02 - gosh what was that don't hang around to
05:05 - find out but curiosity and the need for
05:07 - more resources quickly bring you back
05:09 - down to the depths what a great
05:12 - game so that brings us to the last entry
05:15 - in the Gathering genre and this is
05:17 - called kindling by top script and their
05:21 - sister rain soup shark and what can I
05:24 - say about this game oh wow so it's a
05:29 - beautifully scripted adventure of two
05:31 - kids camping in a forest and within
05:33 - moments of the opening dialogue
05:35 - beginning I was hooked and I mean hooked
05:38 - it's witty clever endearing you get set
05:42 - to the job of gathering firewood from
05:44 - the forest to feed the fire sound boring
05:47 - oh man okay I forgive you you didn't
05:51 - know better I do and I mean I've played
05:53 - this game all the way through three
05:55 - times already and I never skipped a line
05:57 - of the dialogue it is genius
06:01 - and so that brings us to decision time
06:03 - and I feel sorry for the others in this
06:05 - category because they're all winning
06:07 - material but top scripts kindlein is my
06:09 - go-to game congratulations to you and
06:12 - your sister well done best casual game
06:16 - moving on to the slightly more relaxed
06:18 - casual game genre we again have some
06:21 - stiff competition just look at these wow
06:26 - the moment I first played Burger Mania
06:28 - by paban 00 Z I loved it a gigantic
06:32 - monster burger is destroying the city
06:34 - obviously because it's hungry so we must
06:37 - feed it the levels are presented in
06:39 - classic Casual Gamer style and we try to
06:42 - stack the burgers to match the order get
06:45 - it right and you have one happy monster
06:47 - get it
06:48 - wrong and well you wasted precious time
06:52 - and the city is one step closer to
06:53 - destruction as the levels progress the
06:56 - orders get more complex and the gameplay
06:58 - more hectic it's quite the ride so you
07:01 - might think there's no game to rival
07:03 - that but you'd be wrong because w111
07:07 - 004s offering monster Cafe is right
07:10 - there at the same level and as they
07:13 - themselves mention perhaps they should
07:15 - have kept this for the Halloween Jam
07:17 - nonetheless this is a wonderful feeding
07:19 - game presented in the most impeccable
07:21 - manner use the curse keys to select each
07:24 - ghost's desired dish in a frantically
07:26 - spooky Race Against Time and then just
07:28 - when you think it's all over the pace
07:30 - picks up and you have to double time it
07:33 - oh
07:34 - yeah and then we have sling feed by
07:38 - scratcher Greg 96 and our poor Pooch is
07:43 - stranded on a distant Island without
07:45 - food well no problem we have a handy
07:48 - catapult and a pair of fruit trees what
07:51 - could go wrong each level our dog sends
07:54 - us his daily food requirements apples
07:56 - and oranges and it's our job to get them
07:59 - to him this is one of my favorite
08:01 - Renditions of a pullback catapult that
08:03 - I've seen on Scratch and the sounds are
08:05 - just ace too I wish the dog were a
08:07 - little less static and the levels a lot
08:09 - more diverse but the basic gameplay is
08:11 - top-notch and very well-coded
08:14 - H floating dog is at an ultimate
08:17 - difficulty level or a bug who am I to
08:21 - say and that brings us to the last
08:23 - casual game of the group eat it up by
08:26 - Malo and Ouija when I first saw this I
08:29 - was like what but then I started playing
08:33 - nine crazy mini gamess all packed into
08:36 - one project and the first few oh my word
08:39 - I split my sides because they are so
08:42 - delightfully drawn and hilariously
08:44 - animated hats off to Malia and Ouija on
08:47 - their brilliant art Direction the games
08:49 - themselves are fun rather easy there
08:51 - would be much more playability if a high
08:53 - score was included on each mini game
08:55 - perhaps however not playing through each
08:57 - mini game is simply not not an option
09:00 - for anyone the experience is just too
09:04 - good so the impossible task a winner but
09:09 - who will it be it's
09:12 - w11104 with monster Cafe congratulations
09:16 - on this spooky
09:18 - Masterpiece best

09:24 - games a young slime all alone except for
09:28 - his trusty cake Master encounters a
09:31 - dragon the only problem is he has bad

09:37 - stands out for its great atmosphere
09:39 - conjured using clever use of sounds
09:41 - music lighting and dynamic
09:44 - shots but is it feed it enough to win in
09:49 - feed it by llama boy High we follow the
09:52 - conversation between a dude with his
09:54 - super cute chick oh that's my new pet
09:57 - name chick chick and a friend what
10:01 - impressed me was the obvious amount of
10:02 - clever scripting that went into
10:04 - choreographing the text and speech with
10:06 - the character movement and scene changes
10:08 - and gosh that cute chick let's do it

10:50 - this fun encounter between be and a
10:52 - waiter had me in stitches I hope you
10:56 - find inspiration to bring us more where
10:58 - that came from but now we must choose a
11:00 - winner this is so hard Bluey b games

11:05 - technically but BV 15's waffles make me
11:08 - laugh every time I want to give it to
11:10 - you both but the winner is death by cake
11:13 - by Blue batty games well

11:37 - and call of the krg that's cool
11:40 - rectangle guy if you didn't know now you
11:42 - must listen carefully to what they ask
11:44 - for and then press the down key to go to
11:47 - the kitchen space then pops up the menu
11:49 - on screen onscreen buttons were perhaps
11:51 - a bit of a missed opportunity now use
11:53 - the menu to deduce the ingredients for
11:55 - our order and once acquired drop them
11:57 - one by one into the sandwich machine
11:59 - funnel and whack the button and out pops
12:02 - your sandwich hopefully this tastes

12:12 - see how well it Stacks up against the
12:14 - competition because next up 1748 879
12:18 - brings us restaurant Tycoon this time we
12:22 - are controlling this little Pizza

12:28 - oven letting them cook while delivering
12:30 - the pizzas to the customers who have sat
12:32 - down at a table to spice it all up
12:34 - there's also the upgrade shop which
12:36 - allows you to boost your pizza money to

12:40 - come in I guess it could be a quiet day
12:43 - in pizz
12:44 - land here's another restaurant game by
12:47 - Saro named five-star restaurant clicker
12:51 - first thing you notice is the wonderful
12:52 - story and smooth text engine and then
12:55 - into the game graphically it's simple
12:57 - but distinctive you use keys or the
13:00 - mouse to control the game on the PC the
13:02 - keys are much quicker as the orders come
13:04 - in select whether it's an appetizer main
13:06 - course or dessert and then plate up the
13:08 - ordered item as quick as possible to
13:09 - send it off the quicker you go the
13:11 - better as the game progresses things get
13:13 - a lot more hectic which makes it really
13:15 - fun I'm just not sure if the difficulty
13:17 - is an illusion or not as I did expect to
13:19 - have died when the orders overflowed but
13:22 - apparently not and then lastly
13:25 - undercooked in Scratch by Dave Maceno
13:29 - I'm not sure I've ever seen scratch cat
13:31 - and his friends depicted as cute as this
13:34 - before they're adorable but then so is
13:38 - this restaurant game where your scratch
13:40 - Friends Place their orders and you take
13:42 - the role of scratchy getting to work
13:43 - grabbing ingredients and assembling
13:45 - Burgers right on the work surfaces like
13:47 - a pro I just love how this game has been
13:50 - put together it may be a little rough
13:52 - around the edges but man totally
13:54 - forgiven because it's a real joy to play
13:57 - see if you can beat my best score of
14:00 - 520 and with that after much
14:03 - deliberation the winner of the
14:05 - restaurant category is indeed Dave mungu
14:08 - with undercooked in scratch cuteness
14:11 - combined with skill with an awesome
14:13 - assembly mechanic just couldn't be beat
14:15 - great work best farm fishing game so
14:19 - there were not many entries that fell
14:21 - into the farming or fishing categories
14:22 - so I've rolled them into one let's see
14:25 - them firstly we have another Masterpiece
14:28 - by the legendary not a school account
14:31 - where the world has grown desperately

14:46 - seriously the graphics and sound are
14:48 - top-notch and the upgrades are balanced
14:50 - to make you want to keep playing I'm not
14:52 - sure which zone in the fields the fish
14:54 - or the chicken coop drives the most
14:56 - income but it's fun trying them all out
14:59 - out I think perhaps all it needs is some
15:01 - more idle income where strategy can play
15:03 - more of a role where you don't have to
15:04 - be present at all times but seriously
15:07 - wow next up we have fish a far out

17:26 - account with farm farm farm well done on
17:29 - a wonderfully polished
17:32 - game best strategy sluzzle game everyone
17:37 - loves a puzzle right well okay so caged
17:40 - by dabman 67 is a horror survival puzzle
17:43 - you find yourself on a ship in charge of
17:46 - feeding the Beast and there's really not
17:48 - much to go on can you piece together
17:50 - enough to both feed the beast and
17:53 - survive the night great atmospherics
17:56 - with a lot of potential
18:00 - oh nice the delightful gobbles is a card
18:04 - game brought To Us by scratchy long legs
18:07 - 25 where you have to take in the cute
18:10 - gobbles the brown cards and then feed
18:12 - them using the purple cards the food
18:15 - cards but be careful to use the right
18:17 - combinations to feed them just enough
18:19 - but not leave them hanging around too
18:21 - long as they will just leave and you'll
18:23 - lose that round I haven't quite grasped
18:25 - the intricacies of which gobble likes
18:28 - which foods but if I had plenty of time
18:30 - I'd love to play all the way through as
18:32 - it's a real treat with its cute graphics
18:34 - and pleasant narrated Story the user
18:36 - Hollow song has created this fascinating
18:39 - game dragons and kingdoms where we must
18:42 - protect your kingdom from The Fearsome
18:44 - Dragon you do this by balancing your
18:47 - resources planting fields of wheat to
18:49 - make bread and stone to make bricks the
18:52 - trick is that when the dragon attacks
18:54 - you which he will do at certain times
18:56 - you get to choose whether to feed them
18:58 - bread to buy yourself extra time to
18:59 - build up your resources or well
19:02 - otherwise the dragon attacks and then HS
19:05 - Battle Stations did you manage to
19:07 - construct a good defense if not then I'm
19:10 - afraid you don't stand a
19:12 - chance on the other hand with good logic
19:16 - solving yeah I don't think that Dragon
19:18 - will be coming back in a oh my uh moving
19:22 - swiftly on feed it by Robo doog 81 is
19:26 - our last Puzzler and we we take
19:29 - ownership of a green yet very friendly
19:31 - pet dot our goal is to take them safely
19:34 - through this maze only they won't follow
19:37 - you unless you feed them a treat the
19:40 - downside is that they get a little
19:41 - bigger with each feeding the plus side
19:43 - is that they'll follow you for quite
19:45 - some time until they lose interest and
19:48 - then you just have to feed them again
19:50 - problem is get too big and they won't be
19:52 - able to fit through these smaller gaps I
19:54 - love the concept and it certainly had me
19:56 - playing levels over and over again
19:58 - trying to get the best route such that I
20:00 - could feed my pet just the right amount
20:02 - to get me safely to the exit very cool
20:05 - idea but who do you think is worthy of
20:08 - the title of best Puzzler
20:11 - game Gobles by scratchy longlegs 25 for
20:14 - a very unique feed it project that is
20:17 - worth exploring and will keep many a
20:19 - scratcher busy for some time to come
20:22 - excellent
20:23 - job special mention and now my friends
20:27 - we come to a quick fire round of special
20:31 - mention projects no specific game genres
20:33 - just a lot of games that I really loved
20:35 - and wanted to share with you feed it by
20:38 - Nuno game a simple food collection game
20:41 - where you mustn't let the food touch the
20:43 - floor start slow and gets frantic I love
20:47 - it I wonder how far people can go feed
20:51 - the beast by Nether Dragon 222 another
20:53 - feeding the Beast Style game sadly
20:55 - there's a bug so you have to manually
20:56 - hide the thumbnail before you can
20:57 - actually play it please fix this because

21:25 - simplest scratch projects submitted but
21:27 - this new SC rer has somehow stumbled on

21:33 - when key press blocks you have to stop
21:35 - moving to press space to eat the berry
21:37 - and get score holding it down can yield
21:39 - Oodles of score if you time it right but

21:53 - monster feeding arcade game it looks
21:55 - great and plays not so great it feels a
21:58 - little buggy but once you learn how to

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers the theme of our third official Griff patch Academy game Jam was feed it and wow some of the entries are absolutely mindblowing we received over 180 submissions and after literally days of playing through them I'm thrilled to share with you the top four projects from each category why not try to guess the winners before they are revealed and guys keep watching until the end because there's some amazing entries in every category believe me you don't want to miss them guys let's get started best arcade game with over 50 entries the competition for the best arcade game was intense Kaden John kicks things off with their game feeding the fire isn't it cool a very fun game that keeps you on your toes quickly feed the fire with oil before the drops can extinguish it pull out your umbrella to block the drops and when powered up even shoot steam to snip them off from afar next up it's pesky rabbit by Strider 2013 where we get to play as a speedy White Rabbit feeding our faces with carrots I love how very rabbity our movements are but watch out for the hunter out to have his rabbit pie but gosh once you reach full carrot your fearsome carrot breath is Unleashed I can't tell you how entertaining this combo is and you even have a more tricky night cycle to deal with where it becomes very tricky to see that Hunter just how long can you survive the black tiger 7 sneaks into the arcade category with this little gem named feed the cat the trick is to keep their hunger bar topped up while making sure not to eat anything that would disagree with scratchy's rather delicate tummy it starts pretty easy eat the burgers carrots tacos as they fly across the conveyor belt but the speed ramps up quickly and then things get out of control it's a brilliant game that keeps you coming back for more and last but not least Feed Me by just a lemon dude and you can tell from the title screen that this game means business and it does you play this little dude facing off against an unending onslaught of wacky mutations armed with only well a rather awesome rapid firing Cannon which is lucky because you need it the fact that we are feeding these enemies of bullets is made plain when the large Ms burst into the scene I love everything from the great enemies the clean score projected on the ground behind the action and the handrawn Crosshair wow just don't die trying to collect those tempting powerups oh bother so wow each of these games is a blast but the winner is Feed Me by just a lemon dude a welld deserved congratulations considering the competition in this category best Gathering Survival game oh now guys Gathering games these are the games where you must go out to gather resources to complete your mission and oh man have I got the best games to show you it's just a shame only one can win in feed it nuggety 7 has you stranded in a Strange Land where your job is to appease the sleeping Beast by keeping it well fed yeah I guess eats in it sleep and its favorite food is rocks and trees which it just so happens you can pick up in abundance at least to begin with the items get stored in your fast list inventory which means you get to choose when to return to feed the beast preferably before their hunger bar drops too low but don't overfeed them as resources don't grow on trees you know um next up cool Koda 13 presents slime servant in this polished game you need to pick up food scattered randomly throughout the world and bring it to the Slime King but be careful if you run out of energy you will lose so you must eat some of the food yourself only don't let the Slime King see you do it or he won't be happy it's a wonderfully addictive game and I love going back to try and beat my last score I just wish the key for eating food yourself was different to the pickup and give buttons because I kept accidentally eating when I was trying to give to the Slime King and that's game over ah nautical nourishment by word four is for those who like to explore the depths of the ocean initially things look quite simple but the controls and the visuals as you begin to dive deeper really start to draw you in the story is that you need to gather enough underwater resources to cook up some great Seafood to feed all the fish who happen to be swimming all around you most delightfully I'm told using my boids tutorial a great job because it's very well suited to this game wow we can use some of our collected resources to buy upgrades which really helps so we can die deeper and for longer and oh my gosh what was that don't hang around to find out but curiosity and the need for more resources quickly bring you back down to the depths what a great game so that brings us to the last entry in the Gathering genre and this is called kindling by top script and their sister rain soup shark and what can I say about this game oh wow so it's a beautifully scripted adventure of two kids camping in a forest and within moments of the opening dialogue beginning I was hooked and I mean hooked it's witty clever endearing you get set to the job of gathering firewood from the forest to feed the fire sound boring oh man okay I forgive you you didn't know better I do and I mean I've played this game all the way through three times already and I never skipped a line of the dialogue it is genius and so that brings us to decision time and I feel sorry for the others in this category because they're all winning material but top scripts kindlein is my goto game congratulations to you and your sister well done best casual game moving on to the slightly more relaxed casual game genre we again have some stiff competition just look at these wow the moment I first played Burger Mania by paban 00 Z I loved it a gigantic monster burger is destroying the city obviously because it's hungry so we must feed it the levels are presented in classic Casual Gamer style and we try to stack the burgers to match the order get it right and you have one happy monster get it wrong and well you wasted precious time and the city is one step closer to destruction as the levels progress the orders get more complex and the gameplay more hectic it's quite the ride so you might think there's no game to rival that but you'd be wrong because w111 004s offering monster Cafe is right there at the same level and as they themselves mention perhaps they should have kept this for the Halloween Jam nonetheless this is a wonderful feeding game presented in the most impeccable manner use the curse keys to select each ghost's desired dish in a frantically spooky Race Against Time and then just when you think it's all over the pace picks up and you have to double time it oh yeah and then we have sling feed by scratcher Greg 96 and our poor Pooch is stranded on a distant Island without food well no problem we have a handy catapult and a pair of fruit trees what could go wrong each level our dog sends us his daily food requirements apples and oranges and it's our job to get them to him this is one of my favorite Renditions of a pullback catapult that I've seen on Scratch and the sounds are just ace too I wish the dog were a little less static and the levels a lot more diverse but the basic gameplay is topnotch and very wellcoded H floating dog is at an ultimate difficulty level or a bug who am I to say and that brings us to the last casual game of the group eat it up by Malo and Ouija when I first saw this I was like what but then I started playing nine crazy mini gamess all packed into one project and the first few oh my word I split my sides because they are so delightfully drawn and hilariously animated hats off to Malia and Ouija on their brilliant art Direction the games themselves are fun rather easy there would be much more playability if a high score was included on each mini game perhaps however not playing through each mini game is simply not not an option for anyone the experience is just too good so the impossible task a winner but who will it be it's w11104 with monster Cafe congratulations on this spooky Masterpiece best animation in death by cake by Blue bat games a young slime all alone except for his trusty cake Master encounters a dragon the only problem is he has bad aim this amusing animation instantly stands out for its great atmosphere conjured using clever use of sounds music lighting and dynamic shots but is it feed it enough to win in feed it by llama boy High we follow the conversation between a dude with his super cute chick oh that's my new pet name chick chick and a friend what impressed me was the obvious amount of clever scripting that went into choreographing the text and speech with the character movement and scene changes and gosh that cute chick let's do it with a little polish this would be fantastic and next up feed MIT by real polite TI I love that classic Pixar intro have you seen M by the way the water scene is my particular favorite and the voice acting really brings brings this one to life wonderful job and finally Y where are my waffles B 15 writes about her animation waffles welcome to my newest animation it's about waffles and how much I like them I was entranced by the excellent natural voice acting and expression of emotion this fun encounter between be and a waiter had me in stitches I hope you find inspiration to bring us more where that came from but now we must choose a winner this is so hard Bluey b games entry was certainly the most impressive technically but BV 15's waffles make me laugh every time I want to give it to you both but the winner is death by cake by Blue batty games well done best restaurant game so there's been plenty of food themed games in this feed it game Jam no wonder then that we should have a very cool batch of restaurant theme games too let's find the best I'm very hungry in the sandwich Machine by Squiddy the awesome you take the role of a sandwich maker at the beck and call of the krg that's cool rectangle guy if you didn't know now you must listen carefully to what they ask for and then press the down key to go to the kitchen space then pops up the menu on screen onscreen buttons were perhaps a bit of a missed opportunity now use the menu to deduce the ingredients for our order and once acquired drop them one by one into the sandwich machine funnel and whack the button and out pops your sandwich hopefully this tastes amazing all that and you have to fend off rats if you happen to hear them from the shop front it's a clever idea let's see how well it Stacks up against the competition because next up 1748 879 brings us restaurant Tycoon this time we are controlling this little Pizza serving robot and it's super fun dashing around the scene popping pizzas into the oven letting them cook while delivering the pizzas to the customers who have sat down at a table to spice it all up there's also the upgrade shop which allows you to boost your pizza money to the skies if only more customers would come in I guess it could be a quiet day in pizz land here's another restaurant game by Saro named fivestar restaurant clicker first thing you notice is the wonderful story and smooth text engine and then into the game graphically it's simple but distinctive you use keys or the mouse to control the game on the PC the keys are much quicker as the orders come in select whether it's an appetizer main course or dessert and then plate up the ordered item as quick as possible to send it off the quicker you go the better as the game progresses things get a lot more hectic which makes it really fun I'm just not sure if the difficulty is an illusion or not as I did expect to have died when the orders overflowed but apparently not and then lastly undercooked in Scratch by Dave Maceno I'm not sure I've ever seen scratch cat and his friends depicted as cute as this before they're adorable but then so is this restaurant game where your scratch Friends Place their orders and you take the role of scratchy getting to work grabbing ingredients and assembling Burgers right on the work surfaces like a pro I just love how this game has been put together it may be a little rough around the edges but man totally forgiven because it's a real joy to play see if you can beat my best score of 520 and with that after much deliberation the winner of the restaurant category is indeed Dave mungu with undercooked in scratch cuteness combined with skill with an awesome assembly mechanic just couldn't be beat great work best farm fishing game so there were not many entries that fell into the farming or fishing categories so I've rolled them into one let's see them firstly we have another Masterpiece by the legendary not a school account where the world has grown desperately short of food so we must farm farm farm it's kind of a casual clicker combined with a set of farming mini games and man it looks so good you just want to eat it how is this not on the App Store seriously the graphics and sound are topnotch and the upgrades are balanced to make you want to keep playing I'm not sure which zone in the fields the fish or the chicken coop drives the most income but it's fun trying them all out out I think perhaps all it needs is some more idle income where strategy can play more of a role where you don't have to be present at all times but seriously wow next up we have fish a far out fishing game by mnm 3344 oh man that poor cat it's so hungry we just have to feed it if only we had some food well no problem let's fish but first we need a rod not my first choice of walking mechanics great got the rod let's fish and this is really fun when you get a bite you have to reel it in at just the right speed and hopefully you don't get a boot a boot a boot ha and then you get to sell it I cannot wait to get enough to upgrade my rod yay yay and then sell sell sell oh what oh no I think I was too eager to click the cell buttons and now I've broken the game it's so unfair and what about that poor cat and now pigs and chickens it's animal feeding by crowy Wally and I really really want to give these animals their food I've only got a limited Supply but I'll be if they don't just keep walking right over it it reminds me of my pet toad but seriously I feel like I may be missing something here piggy free food just open wide well there's a shop where you can buy more tasty food if only I could afford it yeah this game looks nice it Scrolls and everything I think somebody else must have played this just before me and now the animals are all full yeah that's it so finally game Vision TV brings us feed the fish ah time to sit back and relax in this delightful aquarium simulation drop in some fish Nemo check Dory check mustard yep and the Exotic one check spice it up with some nice furniture and then the fun bit throw in some food oh thank heavens these fish know how to eat the happy sound of munching fish so what do you think who wins this category yeah it has to be not a school account with farm farm farm well done on a wonderfully polished game best strategy sluzzle game everyone loves a puzzle right well okay so caged by dabman 67 is a horror survival puzzle you find yourself on a ship in charge of feeding the Beast and there's really not much to go on can you piece together enough to both feed the beast and survive the night great atmospherics with a lot of potential oh nice the delightful gobbles is a card game brought To Us by scratchy long legs 25 where you have to take in the cute gobbles the brown cards and then feed them using the purple cards the food cards but be careful to use the right combinations to feed them just enough but not leave them hanging around too long as they will just leave and you'll lose that round I haven't quite grasped the intricacies of which gobble likes which foods but if I had plenty of time I'd love to play all the way through as it's a real treat with its cute graphics and pleasant narrated Story the user Hollow song has created this fascinating game dragons and kingdoms where we must protect your kingdom from The Fearsome Dragon you do this by balancing your resources planting fields of wheat to make bread and stone to make bricks the trick is that when the dragon attacks you which he will do at certain times you get to choose whether to feed them bread to buy yourself extra time to build up your resources or well otherwise the dragon attacks and then HS Battle Stations did you manage to construct a good defense if not then I'm afraid you don't stand a chance on the other hand with good logic solving yeah I don't think that Dragon will be coming back in a oh my uh moving swiftly on feed it by Robo doog 81 is our last Puzzler and we we take ownership of a green yet very friendly pet dot our goal is to take them safely through this maze only they won't follow you unless you feed them a treat the downside is that they get a little bigger with each feeding the plus side is that they'll follow you for quite some time until they lose interest and then you just have to feed them again problem is get too big and they won't be able to fit through these smaller gaps I love the concept and it certainly had me playing levels over and over again trying to get the best route such that I could feed my pet just the right amount to get me safely to the exit very cool idea but who do you think is worthy of the title of best Puzzler game Gobles by scratchy longlegs 25 for a very unique feed it project that is worth exploring and will keep many a scratcher busy for some time to come excellent job special mention and now my friends we come to a quick fire round of special mention projects no specific game genres just a lot of games that I really loved and wanted to share with you feed it by Nuno game a simple food collection game where you mustn't let the food touch the floor start slow and gets frantic I love it I wonder how far people can go feed the beast by Nether Dragon 222 another feeding the Beast Style game sadly there's a bug so you have to manually hide the thumbnail before you can actually play it please fix this because it's great because then you're treated to my favorite Beast feeding animation of all time I cannot get enough of these little pigs this was my favorite frog game of the challenge always good to see a frog or two you hop around catching the black and golden flies but just be careful not to eat the infected red fly oh no feed the clbo by V OE is probably the simplest scratch projects submitted but this new SC rer has somehow stumbled on a winning formula because it's using the when key press blocks you have to stop moving to press space to eat the berry and get score holding it down can yield Oodles of score if you time it right but that clbo moves around so randomly it's a real skill to know when to move and when to hold down space I love it feed thy creature by Lemonade bucket is a fun monster feeding arcade game it looks great and plays not so great it feels a little buggy but once you learn how to get that hand to grab the people then it starts to fall into place this game has a huge amount of potential and I really love it so keep at it feed the duck by wbox my singing oh my gosh the voice acting is killer I'm hungry can you please take me down to the pumpkin patch so I can get a pumpkin I love this so much thank you but if you have a duckling at home or duck please do not feed them any fast food and what awesome advice thank you and lastly House of the unfed by edca a crazy take on the classic bat bouncing game where you have to try to feed a weird mouth bouncing the ball off the walls seems to help but then every now and again the mouth pops off to the shadow realm the only option is to follow and continue the fight there if it wasn't for all these crazy ads getting in the way I mean what why and so if I had to pick a final winner for the most fun of the special mention games the winner must be feed the clbo by Vee although there's Limitless room to improve this game its very nature makes it fun I dare you to try and beat my score I think it could be a big hit so thank you everyone for competing in this month's game jam and a special congratulations to all our winners you'll find a link to a scratch Studio featuring all the top games under the video so do go and give them a play they're simply amazing until next time though continue the amazing work and scratch on guys
