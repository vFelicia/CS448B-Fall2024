00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers I hope you had a
00:05 - whole lot of fun with your jump pads and
00:07 - jump rings from last episode today we
00:10 - have something perhaps even more
00:12 - exciting the gravity portals a yellow
00:16 - portal that flips all player movement
00:17 - upside down and a blue portal that
00:20 - brings us back down again this can get
00:23 - real exciting especially as it applies
00:25 - equally to other game modes like our
00:27 - ship or the jump pads and Rings wow for
00:32 - those who don't want to draw the assets
00:34 - themselves feel free to borrow the ones
00:35 - I prepared earlier which can be
00:37 - backpacked on my scratch asset project
00:39 - linked under the video okay then are you
00:43 - ready guys let's get scratching once
00:47 - you've saved your project as a new copy
00:49 - grab some gravity portal assets and
00:51 - bring them straight into our level now
00:54 - I'm not quite sure where I'll position
00:56 - them how about we have a jump ring
00:58 - bounce us into the yellow gravity
01:00 - flipping portal once again this is
01:03 - another unique yellow color so that it
01:06 - doesn't get confused with the other
01:08 - yellow triggers now when gravity flips
01:11 - the player will shoot upwards so we need
01:14 - to make sure there is something solid up
01:16 - there to stop us falling off into outer
01:19 - space now I'll just grab a row of tiles
01:22 - from another scene and drop them in
01:25 - above the
01:27 - portal continuing it on in into the
01:30 - following scene the reverse gravity
01:32 - portal can be taken into the following
01:34 - scene 2 to give us a little bit more
01:36 - time to
01:40 - play so it's worth a test to ensure the
01:42 - yellow portal doesn't cause any
01:44 - erroneous
01:47 - triggering yep that seems okay I could
01:50 - jump straight through the yellow gravity
01:51 - portal without it getting in my way or
01:54 - triggering a
01:56 - jump making sure the level Sprite is
01:59 - visible on on the stage and then click
02:02 - into the player Sprite we'll set up the
02:04 - triggering event find the main menu
02:09 - script and to keep track of whether
02:11 - gravity has flipped I'll make a new
02:14 - variable naming it up for all
02:18 - Sprites right away we will set up to one
02:22 - so even in the game menu We Begin the
02:24 - correct way
02:26 - up this needs copying into the game on
02:29 - screen also so that it resets with the
02:32 - level
02:35 - attempt now to check for portal
02:37 - activations that's in the defined check
02:40 - portal
02:41 - code we'll add a new if to the very
02:46 - bottom checking whether we are touching
02:50 - color and we'll select the fill color of
02:52 - that bright yellow
02:56 - portal and all we do is set the up
02:59 - variable to
03:00 - to1 so that up becomes down and down
03:03 - becomes up oh this is going to be fun
03:07 - now duplicate that if condition as we'll
03:10 - also set up the gravity restoring portal
03:13 - the blue one we need to make it visible
03:15 - on the stage by switching level
03:18 - costumes okay so back in the player
03:21 - Sprite and pick out that blue
03:24 - shade nice this color will switch up
03:29 - back to one again restoring things back
03:32 - to
03:34 - normal now we can make this a little
03:37 - more efficient drop in an if else around
03:40 - those two portal checks we only need to
03:43 - check for yellow portals when gravity is
03:46 - normal that is when up is greater than
03:50 - zero and the reverse for the blue
03:52 - restoring portals that will stop them
03:55 - triggering over and over when they don't
03:57 - need to let's make sure the detection is
03:59 - is working oops I missed the
04:04 - portal okay cool up has switched to -1
04:09 - that's great of course I should be able
04:11 - to test the Blue Portal if I can just
04:13 - get the ship to fly yeah up is back to
04:16 - one brilliant that means we can get on
04:19 - with the far more fun job of actually
04:21 - flipping gravity for our
04:26 - Cube for this we need to locate the
04:28 - Define Cube movement
04:30 - script so take for example this turn by
04:34 - 15 if we were to Simply multiply that 15
04:37 - by our up variable then now it will be
04:41 - 15 when up is 1 and -5 when up is -1 so
04:46 - it turns the exact opposite direction
04:48 - which is exactly what we want so the
04:52 - change speed Y is the actual gravity so
04:54 - change it by
04:56 - -4.3 multiplied by up this next if
05:00 - controls the maximum fall rate to avoid
05:03 - switching between less than and greater
05:05 - than will multiply the current speed y
05:08 - by up instead and then set speed y to
05:12 - -28 multiply by up now careful this
05:17 - change y wants to stay untouched so next
05:20 - up we have the level Collision scits
05:23 - this if decides if we are traveling down
05:25 - towards the floor or not well that wants
05:27 - to flip so again multiply speed spe y by
05:30 - up then we have the jumping code set
05:34 - speed y to 28 multiply by up to flip
05:38 - that
05:40 - too okay so that was my first pass did
05:43 - we miss anything let's give it it Go
05:45 - smash the green flag and flip
05:49 - gravity oh um hold on right something is
05:54 - indeed wrong my first guess is that
05:56 - perhaps I'm traveling too fast into the
05:59 - ceiling and and it's glitching out let's
06:01 - reduce the maximum fall weate from -28
06:04 - down to
06:10 - -22 bother I was expecting that to work
06:13 - don't you hate it when you have bugs
06:15 - like this well just know that it happens
06:17 - to everyone it's just part of being a
06:19 - coder so it must be something to do with
06:22 - the Collision code oh look the move out
06:26 - of level block here it's moving up out
06:29 - of the cision with that one but when
06:31 - gravity is flipped it should be moving
06:33 - down just drop in an up variable and
06:37 - that should fix that
06:40 - one yes houon the eagle has
06:46 - landed and also nicely flipped back down
06:49 - to the floor too how cool is that and I
06:53 - can jump as well ah don't ever fall into
06:58 - space no
07:01 - now you may have noticed that while on
07:03 - the ceiling the player's particles are
07:05 - being emitted out of the wrong side of
07:07 - their body let's fix that click into the
07:11 - particle Sprite and here where the mode
07:14 - is Cube we change y by -16 to move the
07:17 - particles to the player's feet so -16
07:21 - multiplied by up yes and then also this
07:25 - speed y that pushes the particles
07:27 - upwards so again multiply that random
07:30 - number by up to flip
07:33 - it green flag and we flip and that did
07:38 - the trick
07:43 - nice yes next we'll work on inverting
07:46 - our ship's gravity too let's address the
07:48 - ship's particle effects first in advance
07:50 - since we're still here the only thing
07:53 - that needs to change is the turn block
07:55 - here that directs us down towards the
07:57 - thrusters of the ship multiply 90 by
08:02 - up okay nothing much to test here yet so
08:06 - click back into the player Sprite and
08:08 - we'll check out the player's costumes
08:10 - next a problem we have here is that
08:13 - although we can turn this ship
08:15 - 360Â° we don't have a way to flip it
08:18 - upside down but still face right so what
08:22 - we'll do is duplicate our ship costume
08:25 - and add a negative one to the end of its
08:27 - name ship - one then click on the flip
08:32 - vertical button to do the
08:35 - job next up we'll go to the first ship
08:38 - costume and rename it adding a one to
08:41 - the end ship
08:43 - one and although we don't need a flipped
08:47 - Cube costume it will make it easier if
08:49 - we can duplicate that to changing the
08:51 - name to cube NE one and the first Cube
08:55 - to cube
08:57 - one this Chang is going to require a
08:59 - small alteration to our costume
09:02 - switching code the first is in the game
09:05 - on event receiver here all we need to do
09:09 - is join the game mode variable with our
09:13 - up variable to form the full costume
09:16 - name now if you have already implemented
09:18 - skins then you'll need to join with that
09:21 - too since we are having to set the
09:24 - costume multiple times now how about we
09:27 - formalize this in a new custom
09:29 - block name it restore costume and run
09:33 - without screen
09:34 - refresh we can pop both these set
09:37 - rotation mode and the set costume blocks
09:40 - in there and then call it right away
09:43 - with a restore costume followed by the
09:46 - camera tracking block
09:50 - great where else do we change the
09:52 - costume in the when I receive game
09:56 - overripe and switch costume with the new
09:58 - Resto or costume block and then link it
10:01 - all back
10:02 - together and the same in our level
10:05 - complete script replacing again the
10:07 - rotation mode and the set
10:14 - costume there I think that is all of
10:17 - them let's run the project on the
10:19 - ceiling and into the ship portal okay we
10:23 - are indeed upside down both the costume
10:26 - and the particle Trail is working too
10:28 - which is excellent news however the
10:31 - control scheme is still functioning as
10:33 - if I was the correct way up and this two
10:36 - needs to be
10:39 - inverted so to invert the ship's gravity
10:43 - we need to scroll across to the Define
10:45 - ship movement script and once more we'll
10:49 - make heavy use of the multiply by up
10:52 - block invert the direction of thrust
10:55 - multiply one by up and negative-1 by
11:00 - up then the maximum up speed becomes
11:03 - maximum Down Speed speed y multiplied by
11:07 - up capping the speed as usual to 12
11:11 - multiplied by
11:13 - up then we have the minimum Down Speed
11:16 - speed y multiplied by up then setting
11:21 - speed y to -10 multiplied by
11:25 - up the actual change by speed Y is
11:29 - unchanged and in fact that is it so
11:34 - let's give that a shot shall we smashing
11:36 - the green flag and I want to get upside
11:39 - down and into the ship
11:41 - portal there we go and I can confirm
11:45 - that pressing space does indeed thrust
11:47 - us downwards now which is exactly what
11:49 - we wanted and it looks and feels awesome
11:53 - you are really going to love
11:57 - this now there's just a few things to
12:01 - clean up before we finish for today the
12:03 - first is that our camera tracking window
12:05 - needs a slight tweak for the inverted
12:07 - mode because it usually leaves more
12:10 - space below the player so that we can
12:11 - see where we're dropping down to in
12:14 - inverted mode that doesn't give us much
12:15 - view of what lies above so let's scroll
12:18 - over to the camera tracking custom
12:21 - block and once more we'll use the
12:24 - multiplied by
12:26 - uptick but it's a little bit more
12:28 - convoluted here first let's make sure
12:31 - that this last camera Y is less than
12:33 - zero check is moved out of this if to
12:37 - run afterwards instead this is because
12:40 - either ifs will now be able to move the
12:42 - camera
12:44 - downwards next all four mentions of Y
12:48 - position need to be carefully multiplied
12:50 - by
12:57 - up but that's not quite all we will also
13:01 - need to multiply the whole round
13:04 - operations
13:11 - too something like this I told you this
13:16 - was
13:17 - convoluted I'll give you a second to
13:19 - look over that and make sure yours is
13:22 - correct and then we can give it a
13:26 - test okay now we should mind that we get
13:29 - to see a lot more level above the player
13:32 - than we were before that's great news
13:34 - when we are falling
13:36 - [Music]
13:38 - upwards and lastly what about inverted
13:42 - jump pads and wings when placed on the
13:46 - ceiling these need to trigger the player
13:48 - to jump downwards now for this we will
13:51 - need to locate the Define check
13:53 - transporter
13:55 - script and upgrade our set speed wise
13:58 - with a mult multiply by up of course for
14:01 - both the 40.5 and for the
14:10 - 29 and let's check that
14:14 - out up we
14:17 - go and boing very fun what about for a
14:22 - jump ring yeah this has turned out
14:26 - perfectly I can only imagine the level
14:28 - designs you guys will match together
14:30 - with the jump pads Rings anti-gravity
14:32 - portals ship portals Cube portals and
14:34 - the standard gravity portals so please
14:37 - do keep submitting them to the official
14:39 - scratch Studio linked under this video
14:41 - it's such a joy to see and play the
14:43 - community's projects if you enjoyed the
14:46 - video then please take a moment to give
14:47 - it a like and make sure you subscribed
14:50 - so as not to miss the next exciting
14:52 - episode when it drops also if you have
14:55 - any ideas for what we should cover next
14:56 - in this series then drop me a comment
14:59 - well that is it from me today thank you
15:01 - for watching have a great week ahead and
15:04 - scratch on

15:24 - guys

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers I hope you had a whole lot of fun with your jump pads and jump rings from last episode today we have something perhaps even more exciting the gravity portals a yellow portal that flips all player movement upside down and a blue portal that brings us back down again this can get real exciting especially as it applies equally to other game modes like our ship or the jump pads and Rings wow for those who don't want to draw the assets themselves feel free to borrow the ones I prepared earlier which can be backpacked on my scratch asset project linked under the video okay then are you ready guys let's get scratching once you've saved your project as a new copy grab some gravity portal assets and bring them straight into our level now I'm not quite sure where I'll position them how about we have a jump ring bounce us into the yellow gravity flipping portal once again this is another unique yellow color so that it doesn't get confused with the other yellow triggers now when gravity flips the player will shoot upwards so we need to make sure there is something solid up there to stop us falling off into outer space now I'll just grab a row of tiles from another scene and drop them in above the portal continuing it on in into the following scene the reverse gravity portal can be taken into the following scene 2 to give us a little bit more time to play so it's worth a test to ensure the yellow portal doesn't cause any erroneous triggering yep that seems okay I could jump straight through the yellow gravity portal without it getting in my way or triggering a jump making sure the level Sprite is visible on on the stage and then click into the player Sprite we'll set up the triggering event find the main menu script and to keep track of whether gravity has flipped I'll make a new variable naming it up for all Sprites right away we will set up to one so even in the game menu We Begin the correct way up this needs copying into the game on screen also so that it resets with the level attempt now to check for portal activations that's in the defined check portal code we'll add a new if to the very bottom checking whether we are touching color and we'll select the fill color of that bright yellow portal and all we do is set the up variable to to1 so that up becomes down and down becomes up oh this is going to be fun now duplicate that if condition as we'll also set up the gravity restoring portal the blue one we need to make it visible on the stage by switching level costumes okay so back in the player Sprite and pick out that blue shade nice this color will switch up back to one again restoring things back to normal now we can make this a little more efficient drop in an if else around those two portal checks we only need to check for yellow portals when gravity is normal that is when up is greater than zero and the reverse for the blue restoring portals that will stop them triggering over and over when they don't need to let's make sure the detection is is working oops I missed the portal okay cool up has switched to 1 that's great of course I should be able to test the Blue Portal if I can just get the ship to fly yeah up is back to one brilliant that means we can get on with the far more fun job of actually flipping gravity for our Cube for this we need to locate the Define Cube movement script so take for example this turn by 15 if we were to Simply multiply that 15 by our up variable then now it will be 15 when up is 1 and 5 when up is 1 so it turns the exact opposite direction which is exactly what we want so the change speed Y is the actual gravity so change it by 4.3 multiplied by up this next if controls the maximum fall rate to avoid switching between less than and greater than will multiply the current speed y by up instead and then set speed y to 28 multiply by up now careful this change y wants to stay untouched so next up we have the level Collision scits this if decides if we are traveling down towards the floor or not well that wants to flip so again multiply speed spe y by up then we have the jumping code set speed y to 28 multiply by up to flip that too okay so that was my first pass did we miss anything let's give it it Go smash the green flag and flip gravity oh um hold on right something is indeed wrong my first guess is that perhaps I'm traveling too fast into the

job next up we'll go to the first ship costume and rename it adding a one to the end ship one and although we don't need a flipped Cube costume it will make it easier if we can duplicate that to changing the name to cube NE one and the first Cube to cube one this Chang is going to require a small alteration to our costume switching code the first is in the game on event receiver here all we need to do is join the game mode variable with our up variable to form the full costume name now if you have already implemented skins then you'll need to join with that too since we are having to set the costume multiple times now how about we formalize this in a new custom block name it restore costume and run without screen refresh we can pop both these set rotation mode and the set costume blocks in there and then call it right away with a restore costume followed by the camera tracking block great where else do we change the costume in the when I receive game overripe and switch costume with the new Resto or costume block and then link it all back together and the same in our level complete script replacing again the rotation mode and the set costume there I think that is all

in fact that is it so let's give that a shot shall we smashing the green flag and I want to get upside down and into the ship portal there we go and I can confirm that pressing space does indeed
