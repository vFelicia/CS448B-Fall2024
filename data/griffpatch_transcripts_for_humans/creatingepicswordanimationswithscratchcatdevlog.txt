00:00 - foreign
00:03 - ERS I got super excited the other day
00:06 - watching a devlog by a Creator named
00:08 - game Endeavor they presented some
00:10 - awesome sword-wielding mechanics and the
00:12 - most fantastic AI controlled enemy
00:14 - fights I've seen for a long time what's
00:16 - more they gave some great insight into
00:18 - how they had achieved it well in that
00:21 - case I wondered if it might be possible
00:23 - to have a stab at recreating something
00:24 - similar in scratch now that would be
00:28 - amazing so today's video will be the
00:31 - first of a number of devlogs following
00:32 - my attempts at bringing these ideas to
00:34 - scratch beginning with reimagining our
00:36 - beloved scratch cat as a sword-wielding
00:39 - um a a sword wielding yes cat no direct
00:43 - affiliation to other sword clad felines
00:45 - right then my first job was to get some
00:48 - decent scratch cat costumes for that we
00:51 - can pop over to scratchcat's personal
00:52 - scratch profile their projects are full
00:55 - of interesting scratch costumes that we
00:57 - can borrow what we need now is a sword
01:00 - and here's what I made earlier you'll
01:02 - notice game Endeavor is using that
01:04 - floating hand technique to avoid having
01:06 - to animate his players arms very cunning
01:09 - maybe we can pull off the same trick
01:11 - with scratch cat oh gosh perhaps if I
01:14 - widen their shoulders ah nice and so
01:17 - that we can wave the sword around
01:19 - without waving the body too I've split
01:22 - the sword and hand into a separate
01:23 - Sprite to the main cat body
01:26 - the game Loop complete with basic
01:28 - movement scripts will live in the player
01:30 - Sprite we've coded that up a million
01:33 - times before now to avoid the cursed
01:35 - lagging Sprite bug caused by Sprites
01:37 - having their own forever Loops I use a
01:39 - simple broadcast to sword Sprite to
01:41 - bring our sword to the cat and then we
01:44 - are perfectly in sync excellent another
01:47 - bug to avoid is forgetting to edit the
01:49 - sword to face right rather than up all
01:53 - three rotating Sprites must begin facing
01:55 - this way as that's what scratch expects
01:58 - now it will point in the direction we
01:59 - ask it to zero for up a little offset
02:03 - and things are looking pretty sweet
02:05 - scratchies certainly enjoying their
02:07 - makeover so on to more exciting things
02:10 - these sword rotation referring to the
02:14 - source material as I do over and over
02:16 - again as the devil is in the detail
02:17 - you'll notice that their sword is always
02:20 - held back pointing away from the target
02:23 - this is in preparation for a swing
02:26 - attack not only that but we have a
02:29 - virtual arm to account for held at 90
02:31 - degrees to the sword we can do the same
02:34 - by positioning the sword over the player
02:37 - pointing it towards the mouse pointer
02:39 - rotating left by 90 degrees and moving
02:42 - forward that is for the Player's
02:44 - invisible arm then we finally rotate
02:46 - left again to leave the sword facing in
02:48 - the desired Direction
02:50 - string these moves all together into one
02:52 - script and drop in a juicy apple and our
02:55 - scratch cat becomes a veritable Fruit
02:57 - Ninja awesome but look again at the tech
03:01 - demo slowed right down you can see that
03:03 - their attack animation is so much cooler
03:06 - than that the sword swooshes instantly
03:09 - in front of us leaving a white arcing
03:11 - motion Trail to represent the force and
03:14 - speed of the action so cool and we can
03:17 - do that too I just mocked up some Trails
03:19 - using a large Circle including a small
03:22 - second Arc to continue the motion
03:25 - then when the space key is pressed I
03:28 - trigger attack mode and show the motion
03:30 - Trail Sprite
03:33 - and what a difference that makes wow
03:35 - without even moving the sword but it was
03:38 - getting late in the day now and I wanted
03:40 - to quickly complete the sword motion so
03:42 - I mocked it up using a list of
03:45 - directions to Cycle the sword through
03:47 - and it's kind of funny how cool this
03:49 - looks even though there's something very
03:52 - wrong the player's arm is comically able
03:55 - to rotate 360 degrees in a complete
03:58 - circle coming back to the exact spot it
04:01 - began
04:02 - so the next day I studied the motion
04:05 - more closely and I realized I had to
04:07 - limit the arm rotation to a half circle
04:11 - what I had missed was that the sword
04:13 - hand could also rotate from negative 90
04:16 - to 90 degrees relative to the arm giving
04:19 - that full 360 degrees of motion and
04:22 - bringing the sword from one side of the
04:23 - player's body to the other in a
04:25 - beautiful swiping motion yep that was
04:29 - the key at this point having the sword
04:31 - appear behind the player's feet was
04:33 - getting a little bit old and yet we need
04:35 - the saw to go behind the player's head
04:38 - so to fix this I brought in my Sprite
04:41 - layering tutorial code you must make
04:43 - sure to watch that video It's So useful
04:46 - and it's linked under this video and it
04:48 - made short work of the problem awesome
04:51 - that is much better
04:53 - okay time to make this motion more
04:57 - realistic we want the arm to swipe
05:00 - across overshoot and then come back to
05:03 - rest to achieve this I needed to give
05:05 - the arm rotational velocity and emulate
05:08 - a dampened spring physics system luckily
05:12 - a lot easier than it sounds look here's
05:15 - the code
05:16 - so swingder is the direction of our arm
05:19 - answering velocity is how fast it is
05:22 - rotating this starts at zero when it's
05:24 - not moving
05:25 - then we simply set Target dir Target
05:28 - direction to the direction we want the
05:30 - arm to swing to the Target Direction the
05:33 - 0.1 here determines how powerful our
05:36 - spring action is and the 0.65 is how
05:39 - much dampening is applied so that it
05:41 - doesn't keep oscillating back and
05:43 - forward forever
05:44 - that's beautifully simple and also
05:46 - allows us to easily swing the sword back
05:48 - up again by setting Target der back up
05:51 - to the top with a value like negative
05:53 - 180. it looks fantastic no matter what
05:56 - direction we are swinging in and to
05:58 - avoid having the player walk around with
06:00 - their sword in the down position I
06:02 - automatically set the target to bring
06:03 - the sword backer up if the player fails
06:05 - to perform a second sword attack within
06:07 - a short period of time that makes it
06:09 - just feel more natural
06:12 - not to mention also flipping the
06:14 - player's Sprite and their sword Target
06:15 - when the player faces left since their
06:18 - costume and hands are therefore also
06:20 - flipped
06:21 - now I haven't had the cat moving around
06:24 - the screen for a while and for good
06:26 - reason we are in dire need of a
06:28 - reasonably good walk cycle animation but
06:31 - man can I get those scratch legs to look
06:33 - right why is this so hard in the end I
06:37 - did my best to follow the same kind of
06:39 - Animation as game endeavor's video but I
06:42 - can't say I did them Justice anyhow here
06:45 - they are imported back into scratch and
06:47 - at least now we can feel like we're able
06:49 - to dance around the apple and do some
06:51 - serious Fruit Ninja slicing this is
06:54 - getting so fun and wow our sword
06:57 - wielding hero is almost complete a few
07:00 - finishing touches a ghosted shadow
07:02 - Sprite to keep the player grounded and a
07:05 - particle Sprite using clones to emit
07:07 - dust clouds as we skip around the floor
07:09 - and we are done isn't that fantastic I
07:13 - feel this character would slot in very
07:15 - well to many types of games like a
07:18 - zombie apocalypse or an RPG or some
07:20 - crazy epic Fruit Ninja Extravaganza
07:23 - however my goal is to begin
07:26 - experimenting with the Enemy AI
07:28 - showcased in game endeavor's awesome
07:30 - devlog so do join me next time as I try
07:33 - to harness the power of context steering
07:36 - to bring this apple to life I gotta say
07:39 - it's coming along really well guys I
07:43 - hope you enjoyed this little devlog if
07:45 - you want to see more then smash that
07:47 - like button and don't forget to
07:48 - subscribe to the channel and tick the
07:50 - Bell icon to ensure you get notified
07:52 - when the next exciting episode drops if
07:54 - anything in this video got your creative
07:56 - juices flowing then drop me a comment
07:58 - under the video and share what you are
08:00 - planning to do about it are you gonna
08:02 - try to build something similar in
08:03 - Scratch 2 I'd love to hear about it and
08:07 - that's it for me today so have a great
08:09 - weekend head and scratch on guys
