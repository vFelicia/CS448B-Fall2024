00:00 - hi thrift patch and welcome back to the
00:03 - next part of my tutorial on how to make
00:06 - a scrolling platformer in scratch today
00:08 - we're gonna be looking at adding in the
00:10 - exit this is the exciting little port at
00:13 - the end of the game where once you've
00:15 - clicked all the collectables it opens up
00:17 - and you jump into it and it whizzes off
00:19 - and it goes on to the next level we're
00:22 - going to see how far that we can do
00:24 - today so where we left off from last
00:28 - week we're now running in scratch 3 we
00:31 - were looking at the death problem that
00:34 - we had and we fix that so now we need to
00:36 - do is add in the end so when we click
00:39 - these they have a little portal at the
00:41 - end let's see so what we can do and we
00:45 - just make this little screen smaller so
00:47 - we have a bit more space okay so let's
00:50 - begin
00:51 - what we need to do is actually add in an
00:53 - exit first so what we're going to do for
00:56 - that is we're going to clone the
00:58 - collectibles sprite while duplicate
01:01 - sorry not clone duplicate right click
01:02 - and duplicate ok and we're gonna call
01:06 - this exit like so it's a little bit
01:11 - different from scratch too so you'll get
01:12 - used to this idea of how are you rename
01:14 - things and things but that's how you did
01:15 - it in the box ok so what have we got to
01:20 - do now first of all I guess we've got to
01:22 - draw the portal so that's going to
01:23 - costumes we're going to do it very
01:25 - similar to how we drew the collectables
01:27 - so what we actually can do probably is
01:31 - just select that and make it bigger if
01:34 - you hold down alt just so you know the
01:36 - Alt key and drag the corner it resizes
01:39 - from the middle rather than from the
01:41 - edge which is quite useful so we can
01:43 - resize it the size we want and I'll make
01:46 - the middle big again it can hold down
01:47 - alt while dragging the corner so
01:52 - something like that and let's change the
01:56 - colors so the outside glow let's go to
02:00 - the drop down the colors here and we're
02:03 - on radial fill already the circular one
02:05 - we want to swap around these two colors
02:08 - we want the transparent to be on the
02:10 - outside like
02:12 - and we on the inside to be around 50
02:17 - which is right and then 44 saturation
02:20 - drag that down to about 40 yeah and then
02:25 - brightness let's put that right down to
02:28 - 40 so it's just a dull glow at around
02:32 - the edge that's good
02:34 - click onto the middle part and this one
02:37 - is click again on there we want it to be
02:42 - actually no we don't want to raid your
02:45 - fill those we want a solid fill do that
02:46 - this is a closed portal and we want the
02:50 - outline to be one color and the inside
02:54 - to be black so let's just make that out
02:56 - fill black first click on outline and
03:00 - we'll make this the same color as the
03:01 - glow which is color 50 this saturation
03:06 - 40 and the brightness of 40 like that
03:12 - okay maybe make our outline a little bit
03:17 - thicker as well let's make that into
03:19 - four try that so you mean yeah there we
03:23 - are look at our line of four good so
03:26 - that's a closed portal now we need an
03:29 - open portal so if we duplicate this
03:32 - costume that now for the open one what
03:36 - we want to do is change the color of the
03:38 - inside and let's change it to fill and
03:41 - we'll have a linear gradient field which
03:44 - is this one here and the left side we're
03:47 - going to set to again 50 it's the color
03:53 - we like so kind of blue color saturation
03:56 - of 40 and dryness 100 nice and bright
04:02 - like a sky and the bottom color of the
04:05 - fill we want to be white which is
04:07 - brightness 100 and saturation zero
04:12 - that's it that blue to white they're
04:16 - beautiful portal like that very much
04:20 - okay so that's our little portal drawn
04:21 - let's give these costumes names
04:23 - we'll call the open one open and we'll
04:27 - call the closed one closed there we go
04:31 - nice and simple right so what do we do
04:35 - now now we want to be able to position
04:37 - that portal on our level now this is
04:39 - going to be done just the same as we did
04:41 - our little collectibles back in goodness
04:44 - knows which part of our tutorial seems
04:45 - so long ago now but to do that it's this
04:49 - bit of script inside the exit which we
04:51 - have duplicated from the collectibles so
04:54 - it's position so we want to position our
04:55 - portal him and we've still got our
04:58 - little clever m'kay key which hopefully
05:01 - you remember we're just going to tell us
05:03 - where to put something so everyone the
05:05 - project okay we'll go all the way to the
05:09 - end and we want to put our portal just
05:12 - here floating at the end of the level so
05:15 - put the mouse where you want it to be
05:16 - and press m and hopefully everything is
05:19 - still working our little script will
05:21 - have shown where we want to place this
05:23 - so type these numbers into the first
05:26 - clone at so 944 by 22 okay
05:33 - that's in there now we do not want any
05:36 - of these other clones because we want
05:37 - one portal so that will pop that there
05:42 - so we should better give it a little
05:44 - quick check for you run it there we go
05:51 - portal is there closed great right
05:55 - what's our next step let's hide that
05:58 - mouse there because we don't want that
05:59 - anymore so go into availables
06:01 - and get rid of that Mouse good okay so
06:07 - we've reached in the level and the
06:08 - portal is shut we need this to open when
06:10 - we've collected all the collectables but
06:13 - to know whether we've collected them all
06:14 - we need to know how many there were to
06:16 - begin with so we need to have a record
06:17 - of that add it to the game so if we
06:20 - click into the collectibles sprite and
06:22 - we'll add a new variable for all sprites
06:26 - so we'll type this in capital letters
06:28 - again so we know we're going to call it
06:31 - collected max okay so this is the
06:36 - maximum number that you can collect
06:38 - click OK okay now the beginning that's
06:41 - zero but we'll we'll set it to zero as
06:44 - well we'll do it just here under the set
06:47 - collected and we'll set collected max to
06:51 - zero as well okay and now in here we're
06:56 - going to be cloning our new collectibles
06:58 - so if we keep track of every time we
07:00 - clone one by putting a change into here
07:04 - like this change collected max by one so
07:10 - if we were not now collected max it's
07:14 - five and amount collected zero so as we
07:17 - go through the level collective goes up
07:20 - letting max stay the same of course and
07:22 - now collected max and collected at the
07:25 - same so at this point we want this
07:27 - portal to open that stopped the scripts
07:30 - now where are we going to put this this
07:33 - bit of script we're gonna add to the
07:37 - code where here we go in the when
07:40 - received tick this is where we are
07:43 - checking to see if the collectibles
07:45 - touching the player and we're changing
07:46 - the amount of collected by one so in
07:50 - here we can add an if statement just
07:52 - underneath the change collected make
07:56 - sure that deletes underneath if not
07:58 - inside it and we need to compare using
08:00 - an equals operator that collected
08:06 - variable so I is equal to collected max
08:13 - so at the point that you've collected
08:16 - all of the collectibles then we can do
08:19 - something and we'll use an event or
08:21 - broadcast in here like that and we'll
08:25 - book us a new message and they say this
08:28 - is going to be open port or like so okay
08:36 - and that we can receive in the portal
08:40 - sprite so go into the portal sprite and
08:42 - we'll add in the new receiver
08:44 - down here which is going to be open
08:48 - portal and in here we need to switch the
08:51 - costume looks switch costume - guess
08:56 - what open okay so that should open the
09:00 - portal to Reve they go it's quite an
09:02 - exciting change so here I am testing the
09:05 - level collecting all the collectables
09:07 - and I miss this one right the portal is
09:09 - closed and I'm collecting this little
09:12 - collectible it opened the a that's great
09:15 - and now what we need to do is make the
09:17 - script for when we go into the portal
09:19 - that the level will end at present I can
09:22 - collect it because it's just a duplicate
09:24 - of the collectible sprites which is
09:26 - obviously not right so stop this and
09:30 - let's go and fix that so in the exit
09:32 - sprite let's find the bit where we can
09:35 - collect it here we go so in the tick
09:38 - receiver we've got if touching player
09:40 - and then change collected by one and
09:42 - delete the portal which is not what we
09:44 - want so get to that so this is where the
09:46 - scripts are going to go now one
09:48 - important difference here so we don't
09:51 - want this touching to work if the portal
09:53 - is closed so we need to put an operator
09:57 - and we put an end in here now let's
10:00 - replace the touching here with that and
10:02 - put the touching into the second part of
10:04 - the end now on the left side we need to
10:06 - check that the costume if we go down in
10:09 - the looks we'll find a costume here and
10:13 - we need back to the operators we in
10:15 - equals so costume number equals now we
10:23 - can either do costume number equals two
10:24 - because if you're looking in costumes
10:26 - its costume number two is that open one
10:28 - or we can use the name open which is a
10:31 - new scratch to things so we can change
10:33 - the name and put open in there so up to
10:37 - you which you do their costume name or
10:39 - costume number we'll try a name because
10:42 - that makes it a little bit more clear
10:43 - what's going on in the scripts mono
10:45 - number two and when that happens what do
10:48 - we need to do well it's the moment we
10:50 - need to set available exit just like we
10:53 - do when we die
10:55 - but we're going to set it to rather Ming
10:58 - die we're gonna set it to win and at the
11:02 - moment in our scripts that probably
11:03 - won't do anything different to how we
11:04 - die because I think we set it up so that
11:06 - it would anything happens and without ex
11:09 - available it just kills us but let's try
11:12 - it anyway okay let's test this if I rush
11:14 - through this level I'm gonna not collect
11:16 - them all and miss one so that we have a
11:18 - closed portal and I jump through it and
11:20 - I don't go through perfect it was closed
11:23 - if I went through and this time I
11:25 - collect them all and then jump in I die
11:28 - which is exactly what I want because the
11:30 - the moment when I said any thing in the
11:34 - exit available our player sprite or kill
11:38 - us which is what we set here we go when
11:41 - X is anything other than zero blank
11:43 - sorry we died so we need to change this
11:47 - now so that we can do more than just die
11:49 - at the end so let's change this a little
11:52 - bit down here let's add in if-else
12:01 - condition around this die can I even get
12:06 - in my place no I cannot
12:08 - nevermind let's move that out pop that
12:10 - in there like that
12:12 - there we go so what we're gonna do is
12:15 - put the die in the second part of the if
12:18 - in the else part and this condition here
12:21 - is going to check to see whether we've
12:22 - won so put an equals operator in there
12:27 - find the exit available in one side and
12:33 - put win in the right hand side okay so
12:38 - when we finish the game because the
12:40 - exits been set we then check if exit is
12:42 - win and we'll do this and if it's not
12:44 - win we assume we're gonna die now let's
12:46 - create a new custom block for when we
12:49 - win so it's call this game win and we
12:57 - won't run without screen refresh leave
12:58 - that unchecked and drag in your new game
13:04 - win into this side okay so when we exit
13:08 - and when we go into win otherwise
13:09 - to die let's move our game win over here
13:13 - where we can script up a nice new bit of
13:16 - code there we go
13:20 - this is quite an exciting bit and as you
13:22 - saw in the demo at the beginning of this
13:25 - tutorial I had this little animation
13:27 - where the player would we surround the
13:29 - exit and go into it now that's quite a
13:31 - nice little feature so let's have a go
13:33 - implementing that so what we're gonna
13:35 - add in here is a repeat loop for 50
13:39 - frames of animation that's how long it's
13:42 - going to take us to get into the middle
13:44 - of the portal and then we add in a point
13:50 - towards I'm going to point towards the
13:55 - exit like that then we shall turn our
14:01 - player by 65 degrees okay so what this
14:08 - is doing is we point a little character
14:10 - towards the middle so he's facing
14:11 - towards it so if you move forward here
14:13 - to be straight towards the exit but then
14:15 - we turn him away from the exit by 65
14:18 - degrees which moves us into kind of this
14:21 - direction and what that means is that
14:23 - we're actually moving kind of around the
14:25 - exit so let's do that and we want to
14:29 - move forwards and now this is a bit more
14:33 - interesting too because as you're on the
14:34 - outside of the portal you move fast as
14:36 - you go in
14:37 - you move slower as you're going in so
14:39 - what we need to do is have an operator
14:41 - put a divide in there and then you want
14:45 - sin which one is it
14:47 - sensing yep distance to and put distance
14:52 - to portal exit sign in there and divide
14:56 - it by two so we're moving forward by
14:59 - half the distance that we're away from
15:01 - the portal and then other things we want
15:05 - to do is change our player size so it
15:07 - looks like we're going into the portal
15:08 - so go to looks again change size by and
15:13 - we'll put minus 1 in there to get
15:16 - smaller by a little bit each time and
15:18 - we'll also make them fade out as he goes
15:20 - into it
15:21 - say we want to change it's not gummy
15:25 - color we want it to be ghost to make him
15:27 - getting more and more invisible and
15:29 - we'll do that like - so that should do a
15:34 - little animation of us whizzing round
15:35 - and round the portal and at the end of
15:38 - this we are going to change level by one
15:47 - to get us onto the next level and add
15:50 - one more thing which is a weight of one
15:54 - second at the end one more thing
15:56 - sorry we also need to hide hide
16:03 - ourselves after we've done I repeat
16:06 - before we do any weight waiting so
16:09 - should we give this a go and see what
16:10 - happens okay so let's get what's the
16:19 - portal jump in nope that most certainly
16:23 - did not work so you can see even I have
16:28 - bugs in my code so the reason for that I
16:30 - already know is that in our exit scripts
16:34 - if we look at our clone at here
16:38 - when we when we are setting up our level
16:43 - we clone a new portal at this position
16:48 - that we wanted to add but the problem is
16:50 - if we're using clones then our scripts
16:53 - in our player which was trying to rotate
16:55 - around the portal don't work because
16:57 - they're looking at the position of the
16:59 - main sprite for the port the exit not a
17:04 - clone so we want to get rid of this to
17:06 - create clone because we don't actually
17:08 - need clones for the portal we just want
17:10 - to use a normal sprite and position it
17:12 - also what we need to do is remove this
17:15 - set X at the bottom of the setup because
17:20 - now we're not using clones so we want
17:22 - our position to be exactly what we set
17:24 - in here
17:25 - that's one nut again well hold on I'm
17:28 - tiny and upside down that's not quite
17:32 - what I was after
17:34 - let's stop that and fix that too now the
17:37 - reason that's happened is I we are
17:38 - little animation did start to run and
17:40 - it's changed us but we haven't got any
17:42 - scripts in the player sprite to make
17:44 - ourselves the right size at the
17:46 - beginning of the game so let's go
17:48 - through to the game on where it shows us
17:50 - and let's set our size to be a hundred
17:54 - percent here we go so set size to 100
17:58 - there
17:58 - I will also upside down which shouldn't
18:01 - be happening so let's have a look at
18:02 - fixing that what you want to do go into
18:06 - the player direction click on that and
18:10 - let's change it not to be rotating but
18:13 - to be flipping after my instead and that
18:15 - also keep us the right way up so that
18:17 - should be right ok let's have another go
18:21 - run that okay we're back to normal let's
18:25 - collect all of the collectables and jump
18:30 - in yay far better and we are now on
18:36 - level 2 level 2 doesn't look very good
18:40 - does it
18:40 - so we got some work to do there so let's
18:45 - just come back the editor and just for
18:47 - starters let's just add in a little bit
18:49 - of level 2 so we can see that it works
18:51 - so to do that lets go into costumes on
18:55 - platforms and for now let's duplicate
18:59 - our level 1 like so put it at the end
19:03 - and we'll call it level space 2 space 1
19:09 - so it's level 2 and the first part of it
19:12 - and let's just make it a little bit
19:14 - different so we can tell I'll just make
19:18 - it slightly rounded like that what we
19:21 - also need to do is go into the exit code
19:24 - to avoid having this portal appear in
19:26 - the middle of the level let's just add
19:29 - in a clone portal let's just clone it to
19:33 - the right of the level so that would be
19:35 - about 240 I think now click on the
19:39 - platform sprite okay now what we need to
19:42 - do is add in a level 2 script in the
19:45 - up so just duplicate the if inside the
19:51 - else part I'm going to have a check for
19:53 - level two in here or set level to be
19:57 - level two one get rid of that we don't
20:01 - even need the clone part so it's just
20:05 - setting the costume two to one because
20:07 - that all position in our first part of
20:09 - our level at that position and the same
20:13 - needs to be done in danger of course
20:15 - so duplicate the if into the else check
20:22 - for level two and we're going to set the
20:26 - costume but we haven't got us for a
20:28 - costume for that yet so let's just
20:30 - create a new one blank costume called
20:35 - level two one now we'll set that in here
20:42 - as well good let's give that a whirl
20:58 - now we're getting somewhere so the only
21:01 - thing left is our little character is
21:03 - completely invisible you must be there
21:06 - I can move so why is he not it's because
21:10 - when we added our player fading out we
21:14 - faded him - nothing using ghost but we
21:17 - never set him back so that he was
21:19 - visible so show won't do it you need to
21:21 - set ghosts to zero in there so on game
21:29 - on setting his size setting his ghost to
21:32 - zero and we're showing him and I think
21:35 - that will fixed everything and we'll be
21:38 - in a much better place there we go
21:45 - level - very good give yourself a pat on
21:49 - the back if you got this far that was a
21:51 - little bit of a hairy episode I think so
21:53 - thank you for watching I hope you'll
21:56 - come back next time bye now

Cleaned transcript:

hi thrift patch and welcome back to the next part of my tutorial on how to make a scrolling platformer in scratch today we're gonna be looking at adding in the exit this is the exciting little port at the end of the game where once you've clicked all the collectables it opens up and you jump into it and it whizzes off and it goes on to the next level we're going to see how far that we can do today so where we left off from last week we're now running in scratch 3 we were looking at the death problem that we had and we fix that so now we need to do is add in the end so when we click these they have a little portal at the end let's see so what we can do and we just make this little screen smaller so we have a bit more space okay so let's begin what we need to do is actually add in an exit first so what we're going to do for that is we're going to clone the collectibles sprite while duplicate sorry not clone duplicate right click and duplicate ok and we're gonna call this exit like so it's a little bit different from scratch too so you'll get used to this idea of how are you rename things and things but that's how you did it in the box ok so what have we got to do now first of all I guess we've got to draw the portal so that's going to costumes we're going to do it very similar to how we drew the collectables so what we actually can do probably is just select that and make it bigger if you hold down alt just so you know the Alt key and drag the corner it resizes from the middle rather than from the edge which is quite useful so we can resize it the size we want and I'll make the middle big again it can hold down alt while dragging the corner so something like that and let's change the colors so the outside glow let's go to the drop down the colors here and we're on radial fill already the circular one we want to swap around these two colors we want the transparent to be on the outside like and we on the inside to be around 50 which is right and then 44 saturation drag that down to about 40 yeah and then brightness let's put that right down to 40 so it's just a dull glow at around the edge that's good click onto the middle part and this one is click again on there we want it to be actually no we don't want to raid your fill those we want a solid fill do that this is a closed portal and we want the outline to be one color and the inside to be black so let's just make that out fill black first click on outline and we'll make this the same color as the glow which is color 50 this saturation 40 and the brightness of 40 like that okay maybe make our outline a little bit thicker as well let's make that into four try that so you mean yeah there we are look at our line of four good so that's a closed portal now we need an open portal so if we duplicate this costume that now for the open one what we want to do is change the color of the inside and let's change it to fill and we'll have a linear gradient field which is this one here and the left side we're going to set to again 50 it's the color we like so kind of blue color saturation of 40 and dryness 100 nice and bright like a sky and the bottom color of the fill we want to be white which is brightness 100 and saturation zero that's it that blue to white they're beautiful portal like that very much okay so that's our little portal drawn let's give these costumes names we'll call the open one open and we'll call the closed one closed there we go nice and simple right so what do we do now now we want to be able to position that portal on our level now this is going to be done just the same as we did our little collectibles back in goodness knows which part of our tutorial seems so long ago now but to do that it's this bit of script inside the exit which we have duplicated from the collectibles so it's position so we want to position our portal him and we've still got our little clever m'kay key which hopefully you remember we're just going to tell us where to put something so everyone the project okay we'll go all the way to the end and we want to put our portal just here floating at the end of the level so put the mouse where you want it to be and press m and hopefully everything is still working our little script will have shown where we want to place this so type these numbers into the first clone at so 944 by 22 okay that's in there now we do not want any of these other clones because we want one portal so that will pop that there so we should better give it a little quick check for you run it there we go portal is there closed great right what's our next step let's hide that mouse there because we don't want that anymore so go into availables and get rid of that Mouse good okay so we've reached in the level and the portal is shut we need this to open when we've collected all the collectables but to know whether we've collected them all we need to know how many there were to begin with so we need to have a record of that add it to the game so if we click into the collectibles sprite and we'll add a new variable for all sprites so we'll type this in capital letters again so we know we're going to call it collected max okay so this is the maximum number that you can collect click OK okay now the beginning that's zero but we'll we'll set it to zero as well we'll do it just here under the set collected and we'll set collected max to zero as well okay and now in here we're going to be cloning our new collectibles so if we keep track of every time we clone one by putting a change into here like this change collected max by one so if we were not now collected max it's five and amount collected zero so as we go through the level collective goes up letting max stay the same of course and now collected max and collected at the same so at this point we want this portal to open that stopped the scripts now where are we going to put this this bit of script we're gonna add to the code where here we go in the when received tick this is where we are checking to see if the collectibles touching the player and we're changing the amount of collected by one so in here we can add an if statement just underneath the change collected make sure that deletes underneath if not inside it and we need to compare using an equals operator that collected variable so I is equal to collected max so at the point that you've collected all of the collectibles then we can do something and we'll use an event or broadcast in here like that and we'll book us a new message and they say this is going to be open port or like so okay and that we can receive in the portal sprite so go into the portal sprite and we'll add in the new receiver down here which is going to be open portal and in here we need to switch the costume looks switch costume guess what open okay so that should open the portal to Reve they go it's quite an exciting change so here I am testing the level collecting all the collectables and I miss this one right the portal is closed and I'm collecting this little collectible it opened the a that's great and now what we need to do is make the script for when we go into the portal that the level will end at present I can collect it because it's just a duplicate of the collectible sprites which is obviously not right so stop this and let's go and fix that so in the exit sprite let's find the bit where we can collect it here we go so in the tick receiver we've got if touching player and then change collected by one and delete the portal which is not what we want so get to that so this is where the scripts are going to go now one important difference here so we don't want this touching to work if the portal is closed so we need to put an operator and we put an end in here now let's replace the touching here with that and put the touching into the second part of the end now on the left side we need to check that the costume if we go down in the looks we'll find a costume here and we need back to the operators we in equals so costume number equals now we can either do costume number equals two because if you're looking in costumes its costume number two is that open one or we can use the name open which is a new scratch to things so we can change the name and put open in there so up to you which you do their costume name or costume number we'll try a name because that makes it a little bit more clear what's going on in the scripts mono number two and when that happens what do we need to do well it's the moment we need to set available exit just like we do when we die but we're going to set it to rather Ming die we're gonna set it to win and at the moment in our scripts that probably won't do anything different to how we die because I think we set it up so that it would anything happens and without ex available it just kills us but let's try it anyway okay let's test this if I rush through this level I'm gonna not collect them all and miss one so that we have a closed portal and I jump through it and I don't go through perfect it was closed if I went through and this time I collect them all and then jump in I die which is exactly what I want because the the moment when I said any thing in the exit available our player sprite or kill us which is what we set here we go when X is anything other than zero blank sorry we died so we need to change this now so that we can do more than just die at the end so let's change this a little bit down here let's add in ifelse condition around this die can I even get in my place no I cannot nevermind let's move that out pop that in there like that there we go so what we're gonna do is put the die in the second part of the if in the else part and this condition here is going to check to see whether we've won so put an equals operator in there find the exit available in one side and put win in the right hand side okay so when we finish the game because the exits been set we then check if exit is win and we'll do this and if it's not win we assume we're gonna die now let's create a new custom block for when we win so it's call this game win and we won't run without screen refresh leave that unchecked and drag in your new game win into this side okay so when we exit and when we go into win otherwise to die let's move our game win over here where we can script up a nice new bit of code there we go this is quite an exciting bit and as you saw in the demo at the beginning of this tutorial I had this little animation where the player would we surround the exit and go into it now that's quite a nice little feature so let's have a go implementing that so what we're gonna add in here is a repeat loop for 50 frames of animation that's how long it's going to take us to get into the middle of the portal and then we add in a point towards I'm going to point towards the exit like that then we shall turn our player by 65 degrees okay so what this is doing is we point a little character towards the middle so he's facing towards it so if you move forward here to be straight towards the exit but then we turn him away from the exit by 65 degrees which moves us into kind of this direction and what that means is that we're actually moving kind of around the exit so let's do that and we want to move forwards and now this is a bit more interesting too because as you're on the outside of the portal you move fast as you go in you move slower as you're going in so what we need to do is have an operator put a divide in there and then you want sin which one is it sensing yep distance to and put distance to portal exit sign in there and divide it by two so we're moving forward by half the distance that we're away from the portal and then other things we want to do is change our player size so it looks like we're going into the portal so go to looks again change size by and we'll put minus 1 in there to get smaller by a little bit each time and we'll also make them fade out as he goes into it say we want to change it's not gummy color we want it to be ghost to make him getting more and more invisible and we'll do that like so that should do a little animation of us whizzing round and round the portal and at the end of this we are going to change level by one to get us onto the next level and add one more thing which is a weight of one second at the end one more thing sorry we also need to hide hide ourselves after we've done I repeat before we do any weight waiting so should we give this a go and see what happens okay so let's get what's the portal jump in nope that most certainly did not work so you can see even I have bugs in my code so the reason for that I already know is that in our exit scripts if we look at our clone at here when we when we are setting up our level we clone a new portal at this position that we wanted to add but the problem is if we're using clones then our scripts in our player which was trying to rotate around the portal don't work because they're looking at the position of the main sprite for the port the exit not a clone so we want to get rid of this to create clone because we don't actually need clones for the portal we just want to use a normal sprite and position it also what we need to do is remove this set X at the bottom of the setup because now we're not using clones so we want our position to be exactly what we set in here that's one nut again well hold on I'm tiny and upside down that's not quite what I was after let's stop that and fix that too now the reason that's happened is I we are little animation did start to run and it's changed us but we haven't got any scripts in the player sprite to make ourselves the right size at the beginning of the game so let's go through to the game on where it shows us and let's set our size to be a hundred percent here we go so set size to 100 there I will also upside down which shouldn't be happening so let's have a look at fixing that what you want to do go into the player direction click on that and let's change it not to be rotating but to be flipping after my instead and that also keep us the right way up so that should be right ok let's have another go run that okay we're back to normal let's collect all of the collectables and jump in yay far better and we are now on level 2 level 2 doesn't look very good does it so we got some work to do there so let's just come back the editor and just for starters let's just add in a little bit of level 2 so we can see that it works so to do that lets go into costumes on platforms and for now let's duplicate our level 1 like so put it at the end and we'll call it level space 2 space 1 so it's level 2 and the first part of it and let's just make it a little bit different so we can tell I'll just make it slightly rounded like that what we also need to do is go into the exit code to avoid having this portal appear in the middle of the level let's just add in a clone portal let's just clone it to the right of the level so that would be about 240 I think now click on the platform sprite okay now what we need to do is add in a level 2 script in the up so just duplicate the if inside the else part I'm going to have a check for level two in here or set level to be level two one get rid of that we don't even need the clone part so it's just setting the costume two to one because that all position in our first part of our level at that position and the same needs to be done in danger of course so duplicate the if into the else check for level two and we're going to set the costume but we haven't got us for a costume for that yet so let's just create a new one blank costume called level two one now we'll set that in here as well good let's give that a whirl now we're getting somewhere so the only thing left is our little character is completely invisible you must be there I can move so why is he not it's because when we added our player fading out we faded him nothing using ghost but we never set him back so that he was visible so show won't do it you need to set ghosts to zero in there so on game on setting his size setting his ghost to zero and we're showing him and I think that will fixed everything and we'll be in a much better place there we go level very good give yourself a pat on the back if you got this far that was a little bit of a hairy episode I think so thank you for watching I hope you'll come back next time bye now
