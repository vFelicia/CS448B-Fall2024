00:02 - hello fellow scratchers
00:05 - now let's be honest who hasn't been in a
00:08 - situation when they've created a
00:10 - variable for all sprites and only later
00:12 - on found it should have been for this
00:15 - sprite only
00:17 - well
00:20 - once upon a time griff patch feeling so
00:23 - clever began to code the most epic
00:26 - scratch project ever
00:28 - it began with a cat and a variable for
00:31 - health
00:32 - but should it be for all sprites or only
00:35 - for itself
00:37 - well he wasn't quite sure so he just let
00:40 - it be
00:41 - and continued on blindly saying i guess
00:43 - we'll just see
00:45 - then when green flag clicked still
00:47 - unaware of his bloop he set health to
00:50 - five and then straight into a forever
00:52 - loop
00:53 - but just to be sure he muttered assay
00:56 - block won't lag and he dropped in a
00:59 - health block and smashed that green flag
01:02 - five he declared such muscle such brawn
01:06 - but he did not dally no he had to
01:08 - scratch on and so with much health
01:12 - scratchy was ready to fight with a
01:14 - nimble right click griff duplicated that
01:16 - sprite
01:17 - and it looked to be working double
01:20 - avatars of scratch reporting five health
01:22 - apiece a genuine perfect match now it's
01:26 - time to mix it up with patch declared
01:29 - and then boosted one cat's health from 5
01:32 - up to 10. and that's when it happened on
01:35 - clicking the green flag it became pretty
01:38 - obvious he'd just hit a big snag
01:42 - for although each cat's health was there
01:45 - to plainly see they both still reporting
01:48 - the very same exact hp
01:50 - but how is this possible each sprite's
01:53 - health was individually set to a
01:55 - completely different value when green
01:57 - flag clicked and yet
01:59 - oh man this is bad he disliked code
02:03 - rewrites i bet this was all because i
02:06 - opted for all sprites
02:12 - and yes this is indeed the case when a
02:15 - variable is created for all sprites all
02:18 - the sprites across the entire project
02:20 - will see the same value and no matter
02:23 - which one changed it they all see that
02:25 - change and there lies the problem even
02:28 - though both sprites update the health
02:30 - variable in this project only the last
02:32 - value set is seen by both the sprites
02:36 - watch this it's a bit wacky but if i
02:38 - drag the left cat and then run the
02:40 - project now both cats report a health of
02:43 - 10 see
02:44 - no we are not going mad it's just that
02:46 - dragging a sprite on the stage brings it
02:48 - to the front layer and the order our
02:50 - scripts run in are defined by their
02:52 - order so whichever sprite is at the back
02:55 - is the last one to set the health
02:57 - variable and thus that is the value that
03:00 - wins out no wonder some scratchers can
03:02 - get confused right so an interesting
03:05 - aside how can we tell if a variable in
03:08 - our project is for all sprites or was it
03:10 - set for this sprite only well there's a
03:13 - few ways but if you simply click the
03:15 - checkbox next to a variable to make it
03:17 - visible on the stage
03:19 - then take a look at the name of the
03:21 - health variable it just says
03:23 - health
03:24 - right away we can tell this is for all
03:26 - sprites because it does not have a
03:29 - sprite's name prepended to the front
03:32 - look again if i create a test variable
03:34 - for this sprite only then you'll see
03:37 - that this one does begin with the name
03:39 - of the sprite sprite1 so there you go we
03:42 - can confirm that the reason our healths
03:44 - are not working is because of this
03:47 - mistake
03:48 - and it's a very common bug when you are
03:51 - starting out in scratch or following
03:52 - tutorials so the question is how do we
03:56 - fix it
03:57 - well there is no direct way of changing
03:59 - a variable that's already been created
04:02 - so that makes it tricky i guess we might
04:04 - consider just deleting the variable
04:06 - ready to make a new one
04:08 - delete
04:09 - ah where did my script go
04:12 - so yeah careful deleting your variables
04:15 - because scratch is not very forgiving
04:18 - deleting any blocks that make use of the
04:20 - removed variable within this sprite
04:23 - interestingly though if we click into
04:25 - sprite 2 you'll see that the scripts
04:27 - referencing health are not deleted from
04:29 - here which is actually quite interesting
04:32 - since this was the same variable but
04:34 - well there we go
04:36 - so back in sprite one let's rewind time
04:40 - and try doing things a little
04:42 - differently since deleting a variable
04:44 - from a sprite that uses that variable is
04:46 - dangerous how about we delete it from
04:48 - somewhere else that doesn't use it like
04:51 - the stage
04:53 - well let's find out what happens
04:56 - delete
05:00 - so what did this do back in sprite one
05:03 - and two
05:04 - oh look the health variable is back
05:08 - oh man it's been recreated still for all
05:11 - sprites we are right back where we
05:14 - started bother
05:16 - what we learned though is that scratch
05:18 - is quite happy to recreate missing
05:20 - variables if it doesn't find them
05:22 - that does make me curious though what
05:24 - does scratch do if it cannot recreate
05:26 - the variable if we could stop it in some
05:28 - way
05:30 - one rule of scratch is that you cannot
05:32 - create a second variable with the same
05:34 - name as an existing variable on the same
05:37 - sprite
05:42 - well this means that if you have a
05:44 - variable for this sprite only and then
05:46 - try to create a for all sprites variable
05:50 - anywhere else in your project with the
05:52 - same name
05:53 - then scratch also stops you
05:56 - well then
05:58 - how about we create a new dummy sprite
06:01 - and once again delete that global health
06:04 - variable delete
06:07 - now before scratch automatically
06:10 - recreates it as before
06:11 - we make a new variable and name it
06:14 - health
06:16 - marking it for this sprite only
06:19 - oh wow will scratch even allow this
06:22 - you bet it will
06:24 - so what does this mean for the other
06:26 - sprites that try to use the health
06:28 - variable clicking into sprite 1 ok so
06:31 - the health variable has been recreated
06:33 - as before
06:34 - check the visibility box
06:37 - and yes yes look what has happened
06:41 - sprite 1 health
06:44 - scratch has this time been forced to
06:46 - recreate the variable for this sprite
06:49 - only that's awesome
06:50 - the proof is in the pudding so smash
06:52 - that green flag
06:54 - and oh yes look at this we have fixed
06:57 - our bug with a cunning quirk of scratch
06:59 - how cool is that
07:01 - butch
07:07 - might there be consequences to bending
07:09 - scratch to our will in this manner come
07:11 - on seriously what could go wrong
07:14 - oh no wait what
07:16 - well you did ask a consequence of this
07:18 - variable fix is that scratch somehow
07:21 - messes up the variable reporters for
07:23 - this recreated variable they all think
07:25 - they are the first sprites reporter
07:28 - it's not that the variable doesn't work
07:29 - it really does but the reporter will
07:32 - remain broken for all time time
07:36 - so if you need the reporter you'll
07:38 - either have to go make a new variable in
07:41 - each sprite
07:43 - and manually go through switching all
07:44 - references from the old variable to the
07:46 - new one
07:54 - or
07:55 - you might have already done this install
07:57 - the scratch add-ons browser extension
08:00 - you can pick it up for free from any
08:02 - browser app store just googling scratch
08:04 - add-ons
08:05 - this extension has a whole host of
08:07 - awesome and helpful extensions to make
08:09 - scratch a happier place to be in
08:11 - including a number of features made by
08:12 - yours truly
08:14 - one of said features is the swap
08:16 - variable feature
08:18 - all we need to do then is begin by
08:20 - renaming the for all sprites health
08:23 - variable as old health now we can easily
08:26 - identify the bad variable we are trying
08:28 - to fix
08:30 - so now we create the health variable
08:33 - again this time doing it right for this
08:36 - sprite only cool
08:39 - and here comes the scratch add-ons magic
08:42 - right-click on the old health variable
08:44 - and choose the new option swap variables
08:47 - in sprite
08:49 - and we are prompted in an admittedly
08:51 - mildly ugly input box to enter the name
08:54 - of the variable to swap old health with
08:57 - we enter health our new variables name
09:01 - and pow
09:02 - all our old healths have been replaced
09:05 - with our new health variable and they
09:07 - are showing up on the stage as sprite 1
09:10 - health so that's just great
09:12 - and we go into sprite 2 and we do the
09:15 - same again make a new variable health
09:18 - for this sprite only right click the old
09:20 - health variable name and swap it for
09:23 - health
09:24 - pow that's really enjoyable and behold
09:27 - our stage has two health available
09:29 - reporters now so i can delete the old
09:32 - health variable that is no longer used
09:33 - anywhere else in our code and we smash
09:36 - that green flag
09:38 - behold the beauty of these two
09:40 - independent health variables
09:42 - and we rightly can feel very smug with
09:45 - ourselves for getting out of that fix
09:46 - with such style
09:49 - and on that note this is the end of that
09:51 - little scratch tips tutorial if you
09:53 - enjoyed this video then please hit the
09:54 - like button as doing so will make sure
09:56 - that even more people get to see my
09:58 - videos and that would be awesome oh yeah
10:01 - and don't forget to subscribe to the
10:02 - channel too i've put a link in the
10:04 - description under the video to scratch
10:06 - add-ons if this video gets enough likes
10:08 - then hey i'll make sure to tell you lots
10:10 - more about my favorite add-ons that i
10:12 - just couldn't bear to live without but
10:15 - until next time have a great week ahead
