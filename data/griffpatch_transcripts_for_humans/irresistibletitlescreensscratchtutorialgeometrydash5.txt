00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers back for more
00:04 - Geometry Dash fun well after adding the
00:07 - game over explosion effect in episode 4
00:09 - we still left our players hanging around
00:11 - needing a green flag clip to restart our
00:14 - games therefore today we will be working
00:17 - on game continuity this will include
00:19 - automatically restarting the level after
00:21 - each failed attempt counter included but
00:24 - also we'll be creating a full title
00:27 - screen with these super authentic
00:29 - animated buttons which I think you'll
00:31 - find can be added incredibly easily into
00:33 - all your own scratch projects I know
00:35 - you're just going to love them so what
00:37 - are we waiting for open your projects
00:39 - from episode 4 and save them as a fresh
00:42 - new copy for this is episode 5. guys
00:46 - let's get scratching we'll Begin by
00:50 - triggering that level restart on game
00:52 - over that should be relatively
00:54 - straightforward so firstly in the player
00:56 - Sprite scroll down to our game over
00:58 - event receiver at this point the player
01:01 - has just died and explosion particles
01:03 - are still flying around so before we can
01:05 - meet at the level we must wait for 0.7
01:08 - seconds that's just a short time for the
01:11 - explosion to settle and now we want to
01:13 - reset we must bring back the player
01:15 - since they were ghosted clear graphic
01:18 - effects that ensures they are visible
01:20 - again and then we broadcast a new
01:22 - message
01:24 - named reset level
01:27 - excellent so the level reset is going to
01:30 - be actioned in the level Sprite itself
01:32 - so click in there now
01:34 - the simplest way to reset our level
01:36 - would be to rerun these initial green
01:38 - flag scripts again so separate the
01:41 - script off at the top and attach them to
01:43 - a new when I receive hat block for the
01:46 - reset level message and then drop in a
01:50 - broadcast to reset Level under the now
01:53 - empty green flag script that should
01:55 - ensure that the game kicks off just as
01:58 - before shall we give it a try smash that
02:00 - green flag
02:02 - okay looks good except hold on are you
02:06 - seeing what I'm seeing the level Sprite
02:09 - is now doubled up and of course it is
02:11 - because when the level resets we now
02:14 - create two new clones without first
02:16 - deleting the existing ones
02:18 - so when the level resets we must first
02:21 - delete this clone but sadly we then
02:24 - can't reattach the other scripts below
02:26 - well actually we can but first we must
02:29 - surround the delete clone with an if
02:31 - block and then force it to always run by
02:34 - dropping a not block in that if
02:36 - there and now yes that looks much better
02:40 - no doubling up of the level costumes and
02:42 - we can sit back and enjoy trying to beat
02:45 - our levels without the distraction of
02:47 - having to click the green flag of course
02:49 - what we are now missing is a simple
02:51 - counter to keep track of just how many
02:53 - times we've had to restart so click into
02:56 - the player Sprite and create a new
02:59 - variable naming it attempt
03:02 - leaving it for all Sprites
03:05 - when green flag clicked we can set
03:08 - attempt to zero to initialize it
03:11 - and each time we receive the game on we
03:15 - change attempt by one wow I wish
03:19 - everything was that easy
03:21 - attempt one
03:23 - attempt two attempt three and clicking
03:27 - the green flag starts us off all over
03:29 - again that's beautiful
03:32 - so the nice thing about no longer
03:34 - relying on the green flag for restarts
03:36 - is that it frees up the green flag to be
03:38 - used to display the main Geometry Dash
03:40 - game menu and about time I hear you say
03:44 - guys let's create a new Sprite for this
03:47 - naming it menu and just for clarity I'll
03:51 - move it to the top of the Sprite panel
03:52 - as it is the first thing we'll be seeing
03:54 - in game
03:55 - now first off we need a geometry dash
03:58 - light logo we could just use scratch's
04:01 - internal text tool the pixel font is
04:03 - closest and if we then duplicate it a
04:05 - few more times adding bigger and bigger
04:07 - outline widths of various colors then
04:10 - stacking them on top of each other gives
04:12 - us quite a cool effect however if you
04:15 - prefer something a bit more wizzy then
04:17 - you can Google Geometry Dash text and
04:20 - that leads us to GD codons Geometry Dash
04:22 - font generator I've added a link under
04:24 - this video
04:25 - then we just enter the text here scratch
04:28 - dash for example choose your font
04:31 - and then under extra settings reduce the
04:33 - width to 960 pixels that's great for
04:37 - scratch but having changed the width now
04:40 - our text has been wrapped over two lines
04:42 - and if you don't want that to happen
04:44 - then I discovered we can replace the
04:46 - spaces with tilled characters and that
04:49 - works a treat
04:50 - the same blank symbol can be found under
04:52 - the symbols menu under more
04:56 - here
04:57 - then for extra padding I added a tilled
05:00 - before and after the text like so
05:03 - looking good so we can click the
05:06 - download button and save the finished
05:07 - text to our computers as a transparent
05:10 - PNG naming it logo
05:13 - then back in scratch we can then upload
05:16 - the save file as a new costume
05:20 - and doesn't that look excellent thank
05:22 - you GD colon we won't be needing that
05:24 - other costume any longer
05:26 - click that green flag and yeah we need
05:30 - to stop the actual game from starting
05:33 - so click into the level Sprite and
05:36 - delete the when flag clicked script we
05:39 - added just a few moments ago sorry about
05:41 - that
05:42 - but now as well as stopping the game
05:44 - from starting we've also lost the
05:47 - Geometry Dash floor which I was really
05:49 - quite keen on keeping visible for use on
05:51 - the title menu oh well for now we'll
05:54 - fake it go into the level costumes and
05:57 - select the entire floor
05:59 - and then click copy
06:01 - then back into the menu Sprite what
06:04 - we're going to do first is switch the
06:06 - logo into Vector mode this will allow us
06:09 - to more easily move things around so
06:11 - while holding shift drag the title
06:14 - higher up the canvas
06:15 - now hit that paste button and the floor
06:18 - should pop in down at the bottom like so
06:20 - it's looking great in the costume editor
06:22 - but it needs a tension on the stage
06:24 - let's code
06:26 - when green flag clicked
06:28 - go to the front obviously the menu is in
06:31 - front of everything else
06:32 - then make sure it's shown
06:35 - and that we switch to the correct logo
06:37 - costume
06:38 - lastly reposition it with a go to XY
06:41 - block at 0 0.
06:45 - there looking good hold on we don't want
06:48 - that attempt variable showing up on the
06:50 - game menu we can hide it using a hide
06:53 - variable attempts first thing at the top
06:56 - here
06:57 - cool so next up we need a good
07:00 - old-fashioned Geometry Dash begin button
07:02 - right smack in the middle of the screen
07:04 - now I'm pretty sure you can find a good
07:06 - graphic on scratch or the web for use
07:08 - here but right now I'm going to draw my
07:10 - own so make a new costume and name it
07:14 - play that will be important later on so
07:17 - don't forget to name it that
07:18 - this is what I'm trying to copy so using
07:21 - mostly rectangles here goes nothing
07:25 - [Laughter]
07:27 - ta-da it's practically identical what a
07:30 - masterpiece just make sure that it's
07:32 - snapped to the center of the canvas as
07:35 - I've shown you many times before that's
07:37 - important so that it can grow and Shrink
07:39 - right back into the code
07:41 - we have another costume to display so
07:44 - we're gonna need to use clones
07:46 - duplicate these two blocks the first
07:48 - pair is going to be for the Clone so
07:51 - switch to the play button costume
07:54 - and then drop in a create clone of
07:57 - myself before we switch to the logo
07:59 - costume
08:01 - now if you hit the green flag now then
08:03 - both components of the main menu will
08:04 - now be visible great I think we should
08:07 - just move that play button up a touch
08:09 - though don't you I'll try a y position
08:11 - of 15.
08:13 - yeah that's better so now for the fun
08:17 - bit if we look at the real Geometry Dash
08:20 - menu check out how these sweet buttons
08:22 - animate with the mouse over oh wow that
08:26 - is awesome it's not the standard grow
08:28 - and Shrink effect it's got some punch
08:31 - this is called a bounce transition and
08:34 - is practically coded just like we code a
08:36 - bouncing ball in scratch only with size
08:39 - instead of the Y position
08:41 - anyway we'll build this up a little at a
08:43 - time firstly we need to detect when the
08:46 - mouse is over the button when I start as
08:49 - clone
08:50 - go to the front
08:53 - and then we'll begin a forever Loop now
08:55 - there are two possibilities using IF
08:57 - else block either this button is
09:00 - touching the mouse pointer
09:02 - and if so then we can set size to 125
09:05 - percent to make it grow bigger
09:07 - otherwise the button is not touching the
09:10 - mouse pointer so set the size back to
09:12 - 100 just like it began
09:16 - right then this is like the most basic
09:18 - representation of the animation it's
09:21 - crude it works but we can do a lot
09:23 - better
09:24 - I suggest we create a new custom block
09:27 - to help us with the next step
09:29 - name it bounce to size and we need a
09:33 - numeric input of Target size that's how
09:36 - big we want the button to grow to and
09:38 - then a text label Force
09:41 - followed by another numeric input also
09:44 - named Force now this is the direction of
09:47 - growth bigger or smaller
09:49 - and for starters we'll only replace the
09:52 - top set size with our new block that's
09:55 - the growing step
09:57 - the size we want to reach is again 125
10:00 - and this time we apply a growing force
10:03 - of 2.
10:06 - to keep track of how fast this button is
10:08 - growing we're going to need a new
10:09 - variable name it speed ensuring it's
10:13 - created or this Sprite only got that now
10:17 - this pattern is one we use a lot for
10:19 - animating gravity so set speed to
10:23 - and firstly we multiply the current
10:25 - value of speed by 0.9 this is simulating
10:29 - air resistance it stops the object from
10:32 - accelerating out of control
10:34 - then to this we add the new Force
10:37 - remember this is two when the button is
10:39 - growing
10:40 - and pop that all into the set speed
10:43 - block
10:44 - cool
10:45 - finally we change the button's actual
10:47 - size change size by and drop in that
10:51 - speed variable like so
10:53 - oh I feel tingly run the project and
10:56 - hover over that button whoa whoa whoa
10:59 - that's crazy and we are growing out of
11:02 - control we need to put a limit on this
11:04 - if
11:06 - greater than
11:07 - so if the size of the Sprite becomes
11:10 - greater than
11:12 - the supplied Target size that's 125 then
11:16 - we simply set the size back to yeah
11:19 - Target size that will stop it in its
11:22 - tracks click the green flag and hover
11:25 - yes that's it
11:27 - I just have to point out though that as
11:30 - it is now it only works the first time
11:32 - after clicking the green flag as we are
11:34 - not resetting the speed variable but
11:36 - don't worry that will come because now I
11:39 - want to add in that awesome bounce
11:40 - effect when we hit the target size set
11:44 - the variable speed to a multiply block
11:48 - of negative 0.8
11:52 - multiplied by speed that will send it
11:55 - bouncing back in the direction it came
11:57 - only with a little less power than
11:59 - before did you see that that is so cool
12:02 - it really looks like it's popping out
12:04 - and bumping into something haha yeah I
12:07 - could keep doing this all day oh but no
12:09 - we must continue and add the Reverse
12:12 - Falling animation when the button is
12:13 - released uh back up here then and
12:16 - duplicate the bounce block into the else
12:18 - branch
12:19 - the target size is going to be 100. and
12:23 - the force that will be negative two so
12:26 - that the button reduces in size
12:29 - but ah man obviously there's a little
12:32 - bit more to do here my button is
12:34 - shrinking teeny weeny small I can only
12:37 - just get my mouse over it and then pow
12:40 - up they pop well the problem is located
12:44 - in this if condition when growing that
12:47 - is when force is greater than zero we
12:50 - know we have exceeded the target size
12:52 - when size is greater than Target size
12:55 - but when shrinking the opposite is now
12:58 - true we have exceeded the target size
13:00 - when size is less than the small Target
13:04 - size or written another way when size is
13:08 - greater than Target size is false equals
13:12 - false
13:13 - well that is a simple comparison is it
13:15 - not compare the true false result of
13:18 - sizes greater than Target size with the
13:21 - true false result of force being greater
13:24 - than zero this is now true when the left
13:27 - and right sides are both true
13:29 - or both false I'm not sure I'm
13:33 - explaining that very well but do take
13:34 - some time to think about it here we go
13:37 - let's see if it worked
13:39 - and wow yes it did that looks so good
13:42 - almost exactly like the real thing I'm
13:46 - very pleased and yet if I had to be
13:48 - pedantic I might say that the bounce can
13:51 - go on a little too long we could just
13:53 - round that off to be sure
13:55 - if less than
13:58 - use the absolute value if the ABS of
14:01 - speed
14:03 - is less than four then we set speed back
14:06 - to zero to remove any micro bounces
14:10 - and we can test again and gosh at least
14:13 - with my screen recorder running I can't
14:15 - really tell if it's better or not but
14:17 - anyhow it's certainly not worse so we
14:20 - are almost there we just need to make
14:22 - this button clickable
14:24 - when this Sprite clicked
14:27 - now careful we could have clicked any
14:29 - Sprite let's make sure it was the play
14:31 - button not the logo if
14:34 - the costume name equals
14:37 - if the costume name equals play
14:42 - then great this is the right button for
14:45 - safety's sake we wait until
14:47 - the mouse button is released that's not
14:51 - Mouse down
14:54 - and then we broadcast
14:57 - reset level
15:01 - testing that
15:03 - and oops the game starts but we forgot
15:06 - to hide the menu well that's easy when I
15:10 - receive reset level
15:13 - the menu Sprite and its clones will all
15:15 - receive this so stop other scripts in
15:18 - this Sprite we don't want any other menu
15:20 - Sprites to keep on running their Scripts
15:23 - then hide all the menu Sprites
15:27 - and end by deleting all the button
15:29 - clones that should do the trick ing the
15:33 - play button
15:34 - and yes it does fabulous we're almost
15:38 - done for this episode only before we go
15:40 - why don't we add a nice bit of music to
15:43 - our start menu and yes if we search in
15:46 - scratch for Geometry Dash menu music
15:49 - then you'll find someone will have
15:51 - uploaded it yeah here we go this project
15:53 - by Circle illusion
15:56 - funky nice one but it's the music that
15:59 - we're after so find the track and it's
16:01 - this second track menu music so I'm
16:04 - going to backpack that thank you very
16:06 - much
16:07 - and returning to our menu Sprite in our
16:09 - project
16:10 - go into the sound tab and drag that
16:13 - track in from your backpack and all we
16:16 - need to do for this to play is from the
16:18 - code tab drop in a new when flag click
16:21 - tap lock
16:22 - and then in a forever Loop
16:25 - we want to play the sound until done
16:29 - selecting that menu theme cool let's
16:32 - take that for a spin
16:34 - yeah nice to hear that familiar tune
16:38 - yeah the button animation is still
16:40 - Flawless loving it so let's click and
16:43 - the menu music stops and the game begins
16:45 - now that is really cool and to get back
16:48 - to our menu we just click on the green
16:50 - flag and there we go beautiful with the
16:52 - music and I'm loving it oh hold on we
16:56 - lost our attempt counter oh we can fix
16:58 - that just pop into the player Sprite and
17:01 - in the game on script drop in the show
17:04 - variable block for our attempt counter
17:07 - simple
17:09 - and with that we have come to the end of
17:12 - another episode if you've enjoyed what
17:14 - you saw then please do smash that like

Cleaned transcript:

hello fellow scratchers back for more Geometry Dash fun well after adding the game over explosion effect in episode 4 we still left our players hanging around needing a green flag clip to restart our games therefore today we will be working on game continuity this will include automatically restarting the level after each failed attempt counter included but also we'll be creating a full title screen with these super authentic animated buttons which I think you'll find can be added incredibly easily into all your own scratch projects I know you're just going to love them so what are we waiting for open your projects from episode 4 and save them as a fresh new copy for this is episode 5. guys let's get scratching we'll Begin by triggering that level restart on game over that should be relatively straightforward so firstly in the player Sprite scroll down to our game over event receiver at this point the player has just died and explosion particles are still flying around so before we can meet at the level we must wait for 0.7 seconds that's just a short time for the explosion to settle and now we want to reset we must bring back the player since they were ghosted clear graphic effects that ensures they are visible again and then we broadcast a new message named reset level excellent so the level reset is going to be actioned in the level Sprite itself so click in there now the simplest way to reset our level would be to rerun these initial green flag scripts again so separate the script off at the top and attach them to a new when I receive hat block for the reset level message and then drop in a broadcast to reset Level under the now empty green flag script that should ensure that the game kicks off just as before shall we give it a try smash that green flag okay looks good except hold on are you seeing what I'm seeing the level Sprite is now doubled up and of course it is because when the level resets we now create two new clones without first deleting the existing ones so when the level resets we must first delete this clone but sadly we then can't reattach the other scripts below well actually we can but first we must surround the delete clone with an if block and then force it to always run by dropping a not block in that if there and now yes that looks much better no doubling up of the level costumes and we can sit back and enjoy trying to beat our levels without the distraction of having to click the green flag of course what we are now missing is a simple counter to keep track of just how many times we've had to restart so click into the player Sprite and create a new variable naming it attempt leaving it for all Sprites when green flag clicked we can set attempt to zero to initialize it and each time we receive the game on we change attempt by one wow I wish everything was that easy attempt one attempt two attempt three and clicking the green flag starts us off all over again that's beautiful so the nice thing about no longer relying on the green flag for restarts is that it frees up the green flag to be used to display the main Geometry Dash game menu and about time I hear you say guys let's create a new Sprite for this naming it menu and just for clarity I'll move it to the top of the Sprite panel as it is the first thing we'll be seeing in game now first off we need a geometry dash light logo we could just use scratch's internal text tool the pixel font is closest and if we then duplicate it a few more times adding bigger and bigger outline widths of various colors then stacking them on top

same blank symbol can be found under the symbols menu under more here then for extra padding I added a tilled before and after the text like so looking good so we can click the download button and save the finished text to our computers as a transparent PNG naming it logo then back in scratch we can then upload the save file as a new costume and doesn't that look excellent thank you GD colon we won't be needing that other costume any longer click that green flag and yeah we need to stop the actual game from starting so click into the level Sprite and delete the when flag clicked script we added just a few moments ago sorry about that but now as well as stopping the game from starting we've also lost the Geometry Dash floor which I was really quite keen on keeping visible for use on the title menu oh well for now we'll fake it go into the level costumes and select the entire floor and then click copy then back into the menu Sprite what we're going to do first is switch the logo into Vector mode this will allow us to more easily move things around so while holding shift drag the title higher up the canvas now hit that paste button and the floor should pop in down at the bottom like so it's looking great in the costume editor but it needs a tension on the stage let's code when green flag clicked go to the front obviously the menu is in front of everything else then make sure it's shown and that we switch to the correct logo costume lastly reposition it with a go to XY block at 0 0. there looking good hold on we don't want that attempt variable showing up on the game menu we can hide it using a hide variable attempts first thing at the top here cool so next up we need a good oldfashioned Geometry Dash begin button right smack in the middle of the screen now I'm pretty sure you can find a good graphic on scratch or the web for use here but right now I'm going to draw my own so make a new costume and name it play that will be important later on so don't forget to name it that this is what I'm trying to copy so using mostly rectangles here goes nothing [Laughter] tada it's practically identical what a masterpiece just make sure that it's snapped to the center of the canvas as I've shown you many times before that's important so that it can grow and Shrink right back into the code we have another costume to display so we're gonna need to use clones duplicate these two blocks the first pair is going to be for the Clone so switch to the play button costume and then drop in a create clone of myself before we switch to the logo costume now if you hit the green flag now then both components of the main menu will now be visible great I think we should just move that play button up a touch though don't you I'll try a y position of 15. yeah that's better so now for the fun bit if we look at the real Geometry Dash menu check out how these sweet buttons animate with the mouse over oh wow that is awesome it's not the standard grow and Shrink effect it's got some punch this is called a bounce transition and is practically coded just like we code a bouncing ball in scratch only with size instead of the Y position anyway we'll build this up a little at a time firstly we need to detect when the mouse is over the button when I start as clone go to the front and then we'll begin a forever Loop now there are two possibilities using IF else block either this button is touching the mouse pointer and if so then we can set size to 125 percent to make it grow bigger otherwise the button is not touching the mouse pointer so set the size back to 100 just like it began right then this is like the most basic representation of the animation it's crude it works but we can do a lot better I suggest we create a new custom block to help us with the next step name it bounce to size and we need a numeric input of Target size that's how big we want the button to grow to and then a text label Force followed by another numeric input also named Force now this is the direction of growth bigger or smaller and for starters we'll only replace the top set size with our new block that's the growing step the size we want to reach is again 125 and this time we apply a growing force of 2. to keep track of how fast this button is growing we're going to need a new variable name it speed ensuring it's created or this Sprite only got that now this pattern is one we use a lot for animating gravity so set speed to and firstly we multiply the current value of speed by 0.9 this is simulating air resistance it stops the object from accelerating out of control then to this we add the new Force remember this is two when the button is growing and pop that all into the set speed block cool finally we change the button's actual size change size by and drop in that speed variable like so oh I feel tingly run the project and hover over that button whoa whoa whoa that's crazy and we are growing out of control we need to put a limit on this if greater than so if the size of the Sprite becomes greater than the supplied Target size that's 125 then we simply set the size back to yeah Target size that will stop it in its tracks click the green flag and hover yes that's it I just have to point out though that as it is now it only works the first time after clicking the green flag as we are not resetting the speed variable but don't worry that will come because now I want to add in that awesome bounce effect when we hit the target size set the variable speed to a multiply block of negative 0.8 multiplied by speed that will send it bouncing back in the direction it came only with a little less power than before did you see that that is so cool it really looks like it's popping out and bumping into something haha yeah I could keep doing this all day oh but no we must continue and add the Reverse Falling animation when the button is released uh back up here then and duplicate the bounce block into the else branch the target size is going to be 100. and the force that will be negative two so that the button reduces in size but ah man obviously there's a little bit more to do here my button is shrinking teeny weeny small I can only just get my mouse over it and then pow up they pop well the problem is located in this if condition when growing that is when force is greater than zero we know we have exceeded the target size when size is greater than Target size but when shrinking the opposite is now true we have exceeded the target size when size is less than the small Target size or written another way when size is greater than Target size is false equals false well that is a simple comparison is it not compare the true false result of sizes greater than Target size with the true false result of force being greater than zero this is now true when the left and right sides are both true or both false I'm not sure I'm explaining that very well but do take some time to think about it here we go let's see if it worked and wow yes it did that looks so good almost exactly like the real thing I'm very pleased and yet if I had to be pedantic I might say that the bounce can go on a little too long we could just round that off to be sure if less than use the absolute value if the ABS of speed is less than four then we set speed back to zero to remove any micro bounces and we can test again and gosh at least with my screen recorder running I can't really tell if it's better or not but anyhow it's certainly not worse so we are almost there we just need to make this button clickable when this Sprite clicked now careful we could have clicked any Sprite let's make sure it was the play button not the logo if the costume name equals if the costume name equals play then great this is the right button for safety's sake we wait until the mouse button is released that's not Mouse down and then we broadcast reset level testing that and oops the game starts but we forgot to hide the menu well that's easy when I receive reset level the menu Sprite and its clones will all receive this so stop other scripts in this Sprite we don't want any other menu Sprites to keep on running their Scripts then hide all the menu Sprites and end by deleting all the button clones that should do the trick ing the play button and yes it does fabulous we're almost done for this episode only before we go why don't we add a nice bit of music to our start menu and yes if we search in scratch for Geometry Dash menu music then you'll find someone will have uploaded it yeah here we go this project by Circle illusion funky nice one but it's the music that we're after so find the track and it's this second track menu music so I'm going to backpack that thank you very much and returning to our menu Sprite in our project go into the sound tab and drag that track in from your backpack and all we need to do for this to play is from the code tab drop in a new when flag click tap lock and then in a forever Loop we want to play the sound until done selecting that menu theme cool let's take that for a spin yeah nice to hear that familiar tune yeah the button animation is still Flawless loving it so let's click and the menu music stops and the game begins now that is really cool and to get back to our menu we just click on the green flag and there we go beautiful with the music and I'm loving it oh hold on we lost our attempt counter oh we can fix that just pop into the player Sprite and in the game on script drop in the show variable block for our attempt counter simple and with that we have come to the end of another episode if you've enjoyed what you saw then please do smash that like button under the video and you simply must make sure to subscribe to the channel and tick that Bell icon
