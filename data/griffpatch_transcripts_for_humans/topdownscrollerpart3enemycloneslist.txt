00:00 - hi this Griff patch welcome to my top
00:02 - down scrolling game tutorial for scratch
00:04 - we left off here in a zombie cubes game
00:07 - with a single enemy who could follow you
00:09 - around and now we're going to expand
00:10 - that and look at how we can add lots of
00:12 - them now in my zombie cube game there
00:15 - were loads of zombie cubes so you don't
00:17 - really want to have to add them all in
00:19 - by hand one by one so the best thing to
00:21 - do is have a list of positions so we're
00:25 - going to create a list here and it's
00:27 - gonna be for all sprites that's very
00:29 - important because having it list per
00:31 - zombie cube is not gonna work so we're
00:33 - going to call this mobs capital letters
00:36 - so we know it's everything well if this
00:38 - is a term really it came from my use of
00:41 - Minecraft but it'll it'll do here so
00:42 - mobs okay there we have our list but we
00:48 - don't really want to have to enter in
00:49 - the positions by hand either have been
00:51 - nicer to be able to use a bit more of an
00:53 - interactive way in the game so we'll do
00:55 - that so it says hide that list of a
00:57 - second what I'm going to do is have it
01:00 - so that you press a certain key and it
01:03 - will position a mob wherever your mouse
01:05 - is so you can play the game and you can
01:06 - pop the mobs in as you play it so let's
01:10 - go into the player scripts for that and
01:16 - what we'll do is well add in an event
01:19 - went key pressed now let's add it in
01:23 - over here it's a bit out of the way okay
01:26 - the key we're gonna pressed at a mob is
01:28 - gonna be M
01:34 - this M is pressed then we're going to
01:39 - add two mops from the lists and the
01:44 - position we're going to add is going to
01:47 - be operators plus scroll X on the right
01:53 - hand side and then Mouse we're going to
01:57 - sensing X there mouse x + scroll X and
02:02 - another row it's going to be Mouse why
02:07 - a scroll wine so every time you press em
02:10 - it's gonna add the position of the mouse
02:12 - on the level two mops now if we go into
02:16 - our zombie we need a way of actually
02:17 - positioning these mobs as the game
02:20 - starts I've been set up so let's add a
02:22 - new custom block called setup run
02:27 - without screen refresh okay and when we
02:31 - call the setup script here receiver
02:34 - we're going to actually call this setup
02:36 - now so now I'll just move that next
02:38 - wonder there so this is going to be
02:40 - setting up all our mobs
02:42 - let's get some fresh space of e yeah
02:47 - okay so all the positions of the mobs is
02:52 - in this list mobs here so we need to
02:57 - it's call iterate go through the list
03:00 - and find a positions in that list so we
03:05 - need a variable I'm going to call it I
03:08 - but iterator for this sprite only
03:13 - okay and I'm going to set I the very
03:17 - beginning let's get it set X Y and set I
03:21 - to wat and then we're gonna have a loop
03:26 - and we're going to repeat until greater
03:30 - than and on the left we're gonna have
03:35 - the available I repeat until I is
03:38 - greater than the length of the list the
03:42 - ones I is bigger than the length of mobs
03:44 - we're going to stop so in here now we're
03:49 - going to have our set X and wife this
03:52 - first one it's going to be item and then
03:57 - we want there I so I - x - item I of
04:02 - mobs which is one to start with then
04:05 - we're going to have a change I buy one
04:12 - so it's the next item and then change Y
04:16 - sets I set Y to item I of mobs which is
04:20 - going to be the next I'm about to now of
04:22 - mobs and then we're going to change I
04:24 - again so it's going to go through one by
04:27 - one setting the X and then the y to the
04:30 - position of the mob and then at last
04:33 - part of the loop we need to make a clone
04:35 - so that we have our next
04:40 - mob okay this is almost there the only
04:44 - problem we have now is that there's
04:45 - gonna be one extra mob created so if
04:50 - there was two mobs we have to create two
04:51 - clones but then we still have the
04:53 - original sprite and we don't really want
04:55 - that so it'd be useful if we could find
04:58 - a way of getting around that problem so
05:02 - what we're going to do is set I
05:07 - to be zero
05:10 - at the very end so the one that isn't a
05:12 - clone will have an eye of zero now let's
05:17 - see what we can do with that okay so
05:18 - when I is zero we don't want to do
05:20 - anything with the non clone so let's
05:24 - have a control if so in move level let's
05:28 - only move them when I is bigger than
05:33 - zero like so and also
05:39 - we want to make sure when we've set up
05:43 - before we call set up let's set the is
05:48 - visible
05:51 - to false
05:54 - and let's hide
05:58 - or we call setup
06:01 - so this means that the first one isn't a
06:06 - glow when I visit of all set to false
06:08 - and I have zero and which means is
06:11 - physical is gonna be always set to false
06:14 - and when it comes to moving the enemy
06:18 - it's gonna be false so it's going to be
06:20 - hidden and it's not going to try and
06:22 - move anything and so it's just gonna act
06:23 - as if it's never there which is exactly
06:25 - what I wanted to right now if we've on
06:27 - this we've got no enemies at all
06:32 - yep so to add an enemy
06:36 - all we need to do is put the mouse where
06:39 - we want it to be while the game is
06:40 - running
06:42 - press him
06:45 - let's run it again
06:47 - is
06:49 - if we want another enemy its add one
06:51 - down here so please that's what you want
06:53 - it to be what's em and I'll do one over
06:56 - here puts them now burn it
07:00 - there we go and how is this working
07:04 - do you remember look in the
07:08 - the list variable now if we make that
07:10 - visible the mobs have a look what we've
07:13 - got in here we've now got a list of
07:23 - okay list positions this is the X this
07:27 - is the Y the X which is the Y so one two
07:31 - three or mops according to that so like
07:35 - look it's three of them must at some
07:38 - point of pressed M yes in fact there he
07:41 - is
07:41 - stuck down here another one has appeared
07:44 - because at the moment I've got it tied
07:45 - to the M key whenever I press M key it's
07:47 - gonna create a mob so probably a good
07:50 - idea to delete those rows because I
07:52 - don't want that mop appearing in that
07:54 - position so let's delete these top two
07:57 - you probably haven't got those because
07:59 - you probably impress M key but maybe you
08:01 - did let's run that again okay so now
08:07 - hopefully there's no mob damn bottom
08:09 - yeah there we go no mob down there which
08:11 - is what I wanted so these are the
08:14 - positions that we're creating our mobs
08:17 - you may have found zombies starkest
08:20 - getting stuck in walls the problem with
08:23 - the detection of walls in scratches that
08:25 - it sometimes doesn't quite work and you
08:28 - end up with a zombie getting stuck in a
08:30 - wall and not being on a move you might
08:32 - been having that problem already so let
08:34 - me show you how to fix that it's not
08:36 - happening in mine but I'll put it in
08:37 - anyway so let's do that so what will
08:41 - happen is we have the move enemy in
08:43 - Zombie here and it shows the zombie for
08:46 - the first time just here if it's visible
08:48 - now what can happen is it shows it but
08:51 - it's actually already it's slightly
08:53 - overlapping a bit of level now this can
08:55 - happen just because of slight glitches
08:58 - in the positioning or whatever reason it
09:01 - shouldn't happen in theory because we
09:02 - only ever let me you only ever let the
09:05 - zombie move if it doesn't touch the make
09:07 - but it does happen especially when
09:09 - there's off-screen bits of level which
09:12 - it can't detect or for other reasons so
09:14 - what we can do is add in an if statement
09:17 - just after this show and before the
09:20 - follow player and see when we show it
09:23 - whether it's touching a wall already so
09:27 - we need that touching block where is it
09:31 - it is just duplicate that so I've got
09:34 - the right color so if we are touching a
09:38 - green wall the player if they're zombies
09:40 - I is touching a green wall as soon as we
09:42 - show it we should not happen but it can
09:44 - happen and it gets stuck in a wall then
09:45 - we want to try and get me out of a wall
09:48 - so let's run like a new block called
09:51 - escape war like this and we shall all
09:55 - the fun without screen refresh that's
09:57 - fine
09:59 - okay so move that escaped war to here so
10:04 - if when we first show the enemy we are
10:07 - touching a wall we want to run this
10:08 - little escape war routine so let's put
10:11 - that down here and all we simply going
10:14 - to do is try moving him
10:19 - first of all we'll move him to pixels to
10:21 - the left
10:23 - and we'll try moving in two pixels to
10:26 - the right
10:28 - and then we'll try moving him to pixels
10:31 - up and we'll try moving him to pixels
10:34 - down so this just wiggles him around and
10:37 - hopefully that will get him free so
10:41 - that's it
10:43 - the main problem is like says if
10:45 - somebody's moving toward you here and
10:46 - we've been up and down this wall
10:48 - he said he stops moving and it's because
10:50 - he's got into the wall slightly but this
10:52 - routine here will just move him back out
10:54 - of the wall again so it just there's a
10:56 - little bit of a precaution to try and
10:58 - stop at the zombie getting stuck in
10:59 - walls and it does tend to work quite
11:01 - well that's all great what we need to do
11:04 - now is perhaps add in something that
11:06 - actually will mean he can hurt you and
11:08 - restart the level but that probably will
11:12 - have to happen in the next tutorial
11:15 - thank you for watching I hope you
11:17 - enjoyed that and are getting somewhere
11:18 - with this see you next time
