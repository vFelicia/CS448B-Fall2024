In poetry authors use imagery to paint a picture in the reader's mind. When we see the word crocodile. We automatically imagine a green crocodile in our minds. To get an image like this into an animation. We'll use sprites. This make a new sprite block lets you make a sprite and choose a costume for it. Choose a costume for the sprite that you think goes with the poem. To change the sprite's location, you can click the pin icon in the location block. And then click where you want it to go in the play space. In the next few levels, you'll see some new blocks. This block allows you to change the size of your sprite. This block allows you to animate your sprite with the behavior. If a poem mentions wandering clouds, first make the clouds sprite. Then, select this behavior block. Drag it out and choose wandering. Make sure your sprite costumes match. When you press run, you'll read and see a wandering cloud. Now you can add literal images to illustrate the words in the poem. Have fun.
