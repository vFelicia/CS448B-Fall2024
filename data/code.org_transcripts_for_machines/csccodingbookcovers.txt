my name is Sasha Arya Alston I'm a writer and a coder I wrote the book Sasha Savvy loves to code I wrote this book to encourage kids to learn more about coding have you heard the same don't judge a book by its cover maybe it's because a book cover doesn't tell the whole story but what if we can make an interactive book cover that could get people more excited to read the book in the next few lessons you will learn how to code a digital book cover that your friends can interact with in Sprite lab these characters are called Sprites you can change its price costume to represent the main character in your book you can even upload your own Sprite costumes this project is special because you can close Sprites to interact with each other when I chose my book cover for Sasha Savvy loves to code I worked with an illustrator to choose the best images to go in my story if I could code a digital book cover for my book I would want the formulas in the background to float around remember a great book cover helps show what the book is about so people will want to read it I love being creative with my work and can't wait to see how creative you can get with your book covers foreign
