my name is noah and i design the shopping experiences that help customers choose and purchase devices my advice to students is follow your passion and you'll find your unique way to change the world in a good way when we play games it's more interesting if something random happens every time we play an enemy character could pop up in a random part of the screen giving us a fresh challenge every time we play instead of programming every possible move or game outcome which could take a long time we can use the method random which is a static method from the math class let's see how it works first to create a random number we call math.random random is a static method so we can call it in the class which is math this method call returns a random double between 0.0 inclusive and 1.0 exclusive in other words the double generator will be a random decimal number greater or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0 to increase the number range from 0 to a number greater than 1 we have to multiply the returned value of method called by a scalar for example to generate a number random number between 0 and 7 not including 7 we would write math.random times 7. each time we make the call the value remains within the range but we get a new random number to change the starting number of the range we need to offset the range by adding an amount to map that random let's see what happens when we add one another way of saying this is that we offset by one when we do this the range of possible random numbers returned is shifted to be 1.0 to 8.0 notice that both the starting and end numbers were shifted by one math.random generates random doubles if we wanted whole numbers we would need to cast the values but be careful the minimum value will still be one but since we are getting rid of the decimal places the max number this will evaluate to is seven casting seven point ninety nine to an integer makes it seven using random is a great shortcut for creating elements that can change try it
