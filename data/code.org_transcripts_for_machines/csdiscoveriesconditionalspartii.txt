sometimes the decisions you will want your program to make have more than two possible outcomes let's continue our movie rating example where we want to check whether the highest rating you can go see alone is an rrated movie a pg13 movie or just a grated movie to check between these three different cases we can add an elseif statement an elseif statement is another condition but a program checks only if the previous if statements were false so if age is greater than or equal to 17 right that user can see an rrated movie alone else if the age is greater than or equal to 13 right that the user can see a pg13 movie alone else rice if the user can see a grated movie alone the else condition becomes the default condition because when all the previous is San else if statements are false it will default to the else statement be careful as you can struck longer sequences of else if statements if you mix up the order you might not get the behavior you intended in our example imagine we had switched the code so that the first condition check if the user was old enough to see pg13 movies like this this would mean that everyone who is 13 or older would be told they can only see pg13 movies even the adults and with the next elseif line the computer would be looking for people 17 or older in the remaining group this code misses the adults because they were true in that first condition this won't work the computer checks the conditions from top to bottom so it is important to enter the most specific conditions first
