hey I'm Josh and I'm gonna be your co facilitator today we're gonna watch G tear on his TLO take some notes about things that we see him as the teacher do and also things that we're seeing in the classroom and the students so let's let him get started hey everyone good morning I have a question for you when you send text messages to your friends do you always spell the words exactly correctly no all right oh cool what I want you to do is think in your head silently alright and come up with some of the words that you don't always spell exactly correctly maybe you make them a little shorter maybe you use numbers or something I don't want to tell you what you do come up with at least three examples silently in your head and we'll share them with the class give you like 30 seconds seeing some nods so I'm gonna have you just shout them out I mean what do you got what are your words our ETF lol alright I'm gonna skip that one tomorrow okay great just a long one that's all what do you got over here Thanks thx okay all right you know you know I've definitely done that myself because nice nice Wow very short very very short great these are all good examples what I want to know though is why why do you why use these shorter versions of words save time it's easier okay totally just one hand all right I like that anyone else doesn't take up as much space limited okay so maybe you just don't you don't have as much space that you can use well that's great so this is the reason you all do this this is actually an important computer science concept that we're gonna be talking about today and it's called compression now we've been talking about bits bits of information and here what this means is you're sending the same information but you're using fewer bits all right so we're gonna be exploring this computer science concept today Before we jump in who can just rattle off some files that use compression some file formats who knows some just 10 seconds here J jiff zip great good job MPEG great answer wonderful anyone else all right awesome job well it seems like all of you already basically know a lot about this so this is gonna be a lot of fun I want you to look at the people across from you look at these people today we are going to be having a competition with one another you're gonna be competing to see who can compress things the most you excited yeah all right I think so so why don't we all go and get out laptops alrighty and if you can join me we're at unit 2 lesson 2 all right and I'm gonna have everybody get together in pairs so there's a video but let's just get that I know how the Tool Works I'll show it to you I'm here in bubble 3 you don't have to go there yet I'll take care of it eyes up here we have got a message that we want to send and we're gonna be compressing it so I was trying this out last night let me just show you how it works we want to find some things that show up all the time let's find a word that shows up a few times no see that typed it here what are you noticing over here all right there's a symbol yeah I saw that too I thought that was pretty cool so then maybe I want to add another word who is another word they think I should use time great all right so let me break it down let me tell you exactly what's going on here all right we've got our message here don't hold off a second we've got our message here and then we're putting words into the dictionary do you see that uhhuh great okay and then we've got our bytes in the compression ratio that's giving us how much it's getting compressed as a percentage of the original message following okay so then the other thing you can do is sometimes you can put in where I ran into this last night sometimes you can put in words that like aren't even in there and it makes it like if I just put X X did you see how it made it worse let me do it again I'll put in a new one see how it made it worse it used to be ten now it's nine so it's getting worse okay seems like you all are getting the hang of it so I'm gonna let you work with your partner now and just explore in this bubble for a little bit to see if you can figure out for yourself how this Tool Works so what if we just had one even if it's just to throw peanuts more than one yeah I chose to underscore and that's a little better looks like there's a good number than we have oh I totally forgot everybody laptops 45 let's get them close a little bit yeah you know if close them all the way I know you're all doing a really good job I just remembered you don't need to just be one word so what was I'm sorry okay like didn't know is two words but you can you can put them together so I didn't know if I said that before but I think about that and as you're you know figuring out if you're gonna be the best compression in the room like do that okay sound good all right get back to it you know how's it going team what's going on do you have a question is there a way to actually put one of the icons here oh yeah here let me show you okay I know I always thinking the same thing BAM and you just copypaste easy right okay yeah all right well there you go thank you yes it seems like you just copied and pasted you think that looks pretty good we're never gonna win like that it's gotta be like this it's much better okay and then that's it cool yeah cool we're done hey team saw two laptops up doing a little a little bit of email here yeah yeah all done yeah we're done okay I'm gonna say you all if you need to do email for a minute just do that I need Learner hats on maybe in like two minutes okay but if you got an email or something just take care of it okay all righty everybody we're almost out of time so let's bring it back together eyes on me it's about all the time we have today for this I wanted to quickly see what compression ratio everyone got so here's what we're gonna do I want hands up if you have a 25% hands all the way up nice all right 30 32 he's 34 36 okay 38 all right how what do we do over here Wow let's give a big round of applause to the winners of the day y'all could learn a thing or two it sounds like great let's have a quick a quick wrapup reflection here I want you to think to yourself what makes compression hard you can think about that silently to yourself and we're gonna share out already let's just let's just share that out who wants to share out something they thought about if we put yeah words that are too big in the dictionary it brings down the ratio okay so there's this balance it sounds like that you need nice anyone else yeah there's just a lot of different combinations to try it takes a while yeah absolutely all right well that's all the time we have today tomorrow we're going to be practicing how to get even better compression ratios so class dismissed thank you all very much all right so now that GTS finished his lessons let's go over our notes and see if we can identify some themes and maybe some questions that'll drive the debrief
