My name is Jordan and I'm Lakota and Nez Perce. I'm also Hopi and Mojave and I lead a team called Global Outsourcing at Pinterest. Now that you've learnt how to use Sprite Lab, you're going to want to make your program react when someone plays with it. To do that, you're going to use events. An event tells your program to listen for something to happen and then react right away. Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click, an arrow button or a tap on the screen. Blocks like "when key pressed" and "at seconds" are called event blocks. The code connected to an event block runs when the appropriate action is detected. For example, here's a program I started with a wobbling sprite. If I attach another "sprite begins" block to the app's seconds event, my sprite can begin a new behavior after a certain number of seconds have passed. I can also use actions like the change block with events like the "when up arrow pressed" block. Now each time the user presses their up arrow, my sprite gets bigger. Notice that event blocks don't snap into your main program. Instead, they create little programs of their own. Remember that behaviors go until you tell them to stop. If you don't want multiple events to combine behaviors, you'll need to use one of the stops blocks. Other events you learn will let you make different things happen when two sprites touch on the screen or when the user clicks a sprite. Using events you can create imaginative programs and interactive worlds. Give it a try.
