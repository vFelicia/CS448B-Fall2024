my name is elizabeth holm i'm the founder of sonak which is the sisterhood of native american coders essentially we teach indigenous girls around the country how to code through an entirely online program that kind of connects nine to 12 year old girls from many different native communities around the country what we're really trying to do is spark their stem interest at a young age so that they can kind of carry that on with them and also inspire girls around them to do the same to kind of pursue stem and try out this new potentially scary thing i think we can start a chain of kind of the next generation of um indigenous female innovators in stem and hopefully really up that uh the representation that we have um in the stem field
