my name is Luna Ruiz I am a senior in high school and I live in New York City I was one of those kids that my mom would tell me don't touch the fire I I was obedient I wouldn't touch the fire but I'll probably throw stuff at it and make a bigger fire I was always very adventurous and curious that's why I got into computer science cuz I was always curious about how things worked well other than computer science I'm into things like sports I'm a serious athlete I play volleyball softball and basketball I'm really competitive as you can see I'm like compe sometimes I go to sleep very late I don't notice how late it gets sometimes when she's focused on something it's like tunnel vision look Let It Go you pick it up in the morning no but but I almost got it I use JavaScript and python I don't think CS is hard at the beginner stage like it's really easy to get get started and it's cool to create things I have the power to be a producer not so much a consumer all the time I think CS is mostly problem solving thinking logically and and thinking outside of the box when I say that I mean literally starting from scratch like having to make a new idea I think that's applies to basically everything like I think if someone doesn't know what they want to do in their career I think they should take CS
