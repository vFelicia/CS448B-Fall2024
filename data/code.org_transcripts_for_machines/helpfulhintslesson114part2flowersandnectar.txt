if you're having a hard time writing the code for this problem take a look at what we need to do and let's figure out how to translate it into blocks the first thing we need to do is move forward so i'll drag the move forward block underneath when run after that we need to check to see if there's a flower underneath the cloud how do we do that we use this block if at flower that says if you're at a flower run the code inside of this block but what code needs to go inside of that block what are we going to do if we're at a flower that's right get nectar one time so now the code here will have us move forward check that first cloud and if there is you'll get nectar you can see that the b correctly moved forward saw that there was a flower and got nectar but now we still have six more spaces to check i'll let you figure out how to do that on your own happy coding
