For each team, the person who's instructing, that's the person who's holding the paper. They have to figure out what their "off" symbol is going to be, and what their "on" symbol is going to be. What I'm going to do, is I'm going to say the black ones are going to be 1. and the white ones are going to be 2. Ready? Ok! 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2. In binary, it's like an alphabet with two letters. Like having A and B be your entire alphabet. But you've got a 0 and a 1. The most common way you use binary is in an if statement. It's a classic thing from programming. The program runs along and it says "if something is true, then do this. Or it's not true and you do something else. " What if you want to do something maybe a little more complicated? Instead an if statement, you want to work with something like an image or sound in a computer. A computer only knows binary. But an image, is not binary, it's not ones and zeroes. How do you do that? Here's an example. You have this beautiful picture. Now a picture is basically a form of information. All information can be encoded in binary one way or another. can be encoded in binary one way or another, you just have to figure out how to do it. With this picture, the first thing we're going to do is... This all happens with your imagination mostly. Then you translate your imagination into code. You imagine that we'll put a grid over this panda bear. For each square, We'll decide if that square is more black or more white. Then we'll color it that way, accordingly. Each cell on the grid is either black or white, and for the black squares, we say those are zeros (binary digit), and the white squares are ones, the other binary digit. At the end, you're left with just a bunch of ones and zeros. That's how you represent this image in binary.
