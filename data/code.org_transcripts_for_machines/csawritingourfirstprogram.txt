there's a few roles and things to know about writing java code let's explore some of these rules and learn how to write our first program to get started we first write the class header the class header consists of the class keyword and the name of the class the name of the class must be the same as the file the class is public so it can be accessed by our entire program notice that we also wrote my console with an uppercase m and an uppercase c this format is called camelcase camelcase is a naming convention in which the first letter of the first word is either uppercase or lowercase and the first letter of each additional word is upper case when we write the name of a class we write it with an uppercase letter then we write a set of curly braces when we write one java lab will automatically insert a matching closing curly brace these indicate the beginning and end of a block of code curly braces are part of the java syntax syntax is the rules for how a programmer must write code for a computer to understand if we don't follow these rules we will get a syntax error a syntax error is a mistake in the code that does not follow a programming language's syntax for example if we're missing a curly brace we'll get this error next we need to write our main method the main method tells java where to start running our program then we write another set of curly braces java is case sensitive case sensitive is differentiating between lower and upper case letters if we write main in uppercase letter letters we get an error that our program doesn't have a main method so main in lowercase letters is different than main in uppercase letters inside our main method we can write the code that we want java to execute when we run our program
