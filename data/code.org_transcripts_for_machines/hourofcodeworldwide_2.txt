Okay, now, you're gonna press run. Last year, over 100 organizations joined forces to make Hour of Code the largest education event in history. The Hour of Code! This is so cool! [Repeats Hour of Code in other languages] Your teacher says you guys are into it. We are. It's very awesome. Code.org has partnered with 30 public school districts across the country, including New York, Chicago, and Denver to provide lessons in teacher training and writing. The largest education events in history. Organizers have set what they call an ambitious goal of reaching 10 million students this week. Almost 15 million signed up. This week, I'm proud to join the students, teachers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations taking new steps to support computer science in America's schools. I ran an Hour of Code. It's easy to do. I got it! They've been so excited about it. Oh my gosh, it's working. I did it! They don't even have to be a computer science engineer. Maybe they want to do something else, but in our world this is gonna be the basis for everything that we do. Obama "Move. Semicolon." I'm so excited! I'm actually gonna code. When you're building a program, you have to think outside of the box. If you can change technology, you can change the world. I challenge girls in every single country to learn one hour of code. Yes! Every district should do it. Every district can do it. Please help us get the Hour of Code to every school, and every classroom, and every child. And my school is doing it! Calling all teachers worldwide. Help us reach 200 million students this December.
