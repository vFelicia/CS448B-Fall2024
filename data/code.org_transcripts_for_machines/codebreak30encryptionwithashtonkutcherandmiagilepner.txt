hi everybody and welcome to code break last week we had over 18 000 total viewers between zoom and facebook this week we have viewers from all around the world not only throughout the united states but as far south as chile and as far east as india and even china we have viewers coming from from new york from spain together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom if you whether you're a student or a parent joining us today if you're enjoying this uh and if you enjoy the whether it's the community or the education please invite other parents and families to join us together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom to provide not only education in an hour of child care at a time when students are at home but also a sense of community in a place people can get together at this time when we're all studying alone uh i want to introduce my daughter and sidekick sophia to join and today we have two very special guests joining us uh renowned actor and entrepreneur ashton kutcher ashton are you there with us i'm here how's it going good how are you doing i'm lovely and then we have cyber security professional and former nsa engineer mia gillepner mia are you there i am hi everyone good to see you mia good to see you too where are you joining us from today mia i am joining from berkeley california in my living room and you now work at a cyber security company called expanse but you used to work for the department of defense in this sort of spy agency i'm looking forward to hearing about your work later but we're going to start for the first 20 minutes with ashton because he has a limited amount of time uh ashton where are you calling from i'm calling from my house in los angeles all right so what have you been doing with all this extra time we have well i've been in my house now uh for about four and a half weeks uh and um i have two kids one's five and one's three so we're spending a lot of time uh doing home school uh and we figured out uh as many of you have figured out that the best way to do homeschool is to actually outsource it and so we have a lot of our friends calling in with 30 minute teach me anythings uh with our kids which has been just awesome uh and uh trying to do a little bit of work we have a lot of companies at soundventures which is my investment fund and a lot of these companies uh given the sort of economic times that we're all about to face are facing a lot of changes so i've been working with a lot of them as to how how they can make the changes inside their companies um in order to sort of not only survive but thrive through this period of time and uh beyond that i've been working hard to get uh ppe personal protective equipment uh to hospitals around the country and uh figuring out how to get uh broadbased testing um uh syndicated as widely as possible so uh just you know pounding it away and trying to do my best to stay and stay busy um but also just having a lot of fun um i find i don't spend a lot of time at home because i end up working so much so it's really exciting for me to actually just be home and and get like find the precipice of being bored uh because because when you finally let your mind get to the point where your boy that's when you start to get creative i think yeah well for the homeschooling for your fiveyearolds you're welcome to have them join code break each week for one hour uh our our show starts with stuff that the youngest kids can even follow along so at least the first half hour of it should be pretty fun um do you have any thoughts to share with the students who are all at home while school is closed basically all around the country and all around the world almost a billion students are now at home yeah i mean here's the thing when i was in school this was like a this would be like a dream like not having to go to school would seem like it would be like a dream for me so but then you're faced with the reality of it you're like wait a second i kind of want to hang out with my friends and actually uh when i'm at school it's really fun and i learn things and so uh i guess my advice is is like actually the the coolest thing is when you're at school all the time you kind of have to do and learn just what everybody else is learning and when you're doing homeschooling stuff you may have a little bit more time to learn and focus on the things that you really care about and and and build things um because i really do think that that the brightest and and coolest things that are going to be built are going to be built by you guys um and you're you're you are you are building the future right now whether you know it or not uh because the the thoughts and ideas that you're getting in your head um those are going to be the future and and i'm excited to live in your future all right well i'm home with my family as well my daughter sophia joins us each week partly to learn partly to keep me in check she's got an app to make sound effects you want to make us a sound effect right now um so she's my daughter and a student and a cohost and also part of the production crew and we're going to be fantastic we're going to start with this week's computer joke of the day with sophia so ashton what clothing does a computer programmer wear a hoodie nope whatever is in the dress code the dress code all right yeah i have to give a dad joke once a week um let's meet some of the live audience who's on camera we have dozens of students on camera uh can everybody wave and say hi to ashton hey also learn a bit about the rest of our audience uh those of you who've been joining us each week you may notice that we've disabled the chat feature it's only accessible to the folks who are live on camera you can still see what those folks are typing if you click chat but we had to disable this because last week some students use very offensive language i've written personal letters to the students who acted this way giving them a chance to apologize and we establish a code of conduct for code break to make sure everybody behaves in a way that's consistent with being a respectful young adult whether in a classroom or a future career but we still have the opportunity to engage our entire audience interactively even without chat for example to find out where everybody's from we use the geographic poll and i'm going to screen share this and ash and mia you can let us know if you're surprised from one of some of the places that people are calling in from wow that is impressive there's a lot of people from antarctica that it seems i want to be in antarctica right now you you wouldn't have to worry about getting coronavirus that is that's true there's people as far east as china where it's very late in their day now let's do another live poll we want to get a sense of what grade the students are in so we're going to post a live poll to see to have everybody enter your grade and this is going to come up on your screen sofia you want to fill out your poll right there all right we're getting the answers coming in it seems like the biggest group is in in sixth to eighth grade but there's literally all grades represented wow all right could we uh around 70 800 of you have voted so these are the poll results for what grade students earn we have kindergarteners all the way through 12th grades and at least 16 of our audience is beyond k12 let's do another poll to find out your computer science experience level because there's people who are total beginners and people who are advanced and we want to have something for everybody so if you could all enter your levels sophia you can enter yours too and what we're going to do each week is we start with material that's great for the beginners and then we'll get more and more advanced so if you're a beginner the fast stuff at the end even if you can't follow along you should just try to watch it because you learn a little bit and if you're more advanced uh it doesn't matter to if we'd love for you to be patient to the early stuff we'll try to make something that everybody can learn all right we have 70 of the audience having uh voted so if we could share those results on screen as well all right yeah you can see that majority of the group are intermediate uh so as we go through this i i can i can i just say something about watching advanced people work um you know i always think about uh you know programming or anything like this i always think about it like uh watching like a basketball game or a professional football game or something like that like when you watch people who are really really great and professionals and advanced at something it gives you ideas and inspires how you can potentially work so it's really important to watch people that are better at you doing stuff because you'll learn tricks and ideas and and things that and even though you don't completely understand why they're doing everything they're doing or how they're doing it you can get inspired from it and someday you'll see yourself and look back and go oh wait i remember when i was watching that that person that was way better than me doing something so just think about like watching like the nba or something like that we don't have to be that good at basketball to watch and enjoy the nba absolutely by the way for the folks who are not going to be on camera and really for all of you if you have questions during this episode there's a q button for q a button which you can click to submit questions the team at code.org will answer many of your questions live in real time and we're going to have some of the best questions read out for ashton and also from mia gil ebner tweet for us at today's episode we're going to learn about encryption we're going to have three segments first we're going to learn about a simple cipher next we're going to learn about password strength which is something the adults can even benefit from and lastly we're going to in real time code an app to help us make passwords that are stronger than the ones you probably use uh this is our third time doing this kind of a live interactive format with thousands of people on one zoom call so we are going to have glitches when we have glitches we're going to learn an important computer science concept called debugging this is bug and so please bear with us if we have any issues as we go uh so before we start the lesson we want to welcome two student groups to demo their creations from last week last week's challenge was to create an app or an interactive card and each week when you share your creations with us we'll invite you on the show next week to share them so first i'd like to introduce hannah christina pratusha sophia and lily this is a five person team uh can you all say hi so we can see you hi and can we switch to gallery view as well so we can so folks can see all these students all right um so uh hannah can you say hello and tell us where you're all from and introduce your teammates yes we're all from franklin massachusetts and franklin high school my uh teammates are lily sophia ceramides patricia nadori and elizabeth fall all right uh so i'm gonna put your app on screen share and then you can describe the app uh for and for ashton to basically react to it so give me just one second and this is the app that the this group made as a team all right can you all see my app all right you're going to go ahead and tell us about it so the app we develop is based on the mental health issues that occur among adolescents the prevalence of mental health issues is largest among young adults with approximately one in five teens suffering from at least one mental health disorder these disorders can have a significant impact on daily life and overall wellbeing our goal is to create an app that aided students in resolving these issues through the use of various resources right at their fingertips based on the structure of the app no matter what conflict the student is experiencing the app provides a solution accordingly the user begins by signing in or logging in from there they choose a userfriendly emoji representing the current emotion they are then prompted to select the category a problem that they are facing if any from there students are provided with multiple paths eventually resulting in a problemspecific solution for the student with over 20 screens the app allows for a resolution to almost any problem equipped with back buttons so students are able to navigate easily between screens especially if they are facing multiple issues our hope is that with our app teams will be more equipped with the skills they need to develop socially and emotionally thank you wow so if i want to try this app tell me what should i do i guess i should click the welcome button yes yeah all right i'm not going to log in or sign up i'll use it as a guest so let's check in ashton how are you feeling today uh i'm i'm feeling fantastic well that's pretty good all right the app is glad to see you're doing so well let's pretend thank you thank you app of course let's try it again and pretend we're not feeling as good to see what hannah and her team have prepared so what's a less good feeling mission i am devastated and really sad and crying what is bothering you what is bothering me oh boy i'm just stressed out about my future plans future plans all right are you worried more about college or your standardized tests oh man i'm uh i'm worried about college it seems that i didn't go first or finding a college i think it sounds like getting into college is your warrior probably i should try to get into a college since i've never gone well i i quit i dropped out so all right so if you're worried about getting your grades or upcoming assessments here's some resources so for regardless of which subject you're in there's resources and websites that helped you study in this app oh great that's right that's wonderful uh let's switch to the next app and the next student is sophie here with us as well hi hi sophie where are you calling from bellevue washington bellevue washington can you tell us about your app and then we'll screenshare it and go through a demo yeah so as a teen entrepreneur myself of a fashion backpack business called tashan bags i understand the value and importance of small businesses in our time especially with the coronavirus so our local restaurants are truly the heart of our community and bellevue bites offers a list of restaurants updated daily near you that are offering takeout delivery discounts because a lot of people are on a tight budget right now but still want to afford to support local businesses so right now bellevue bites serves the seattle and bellevue area but we hope to evolve in the future and unlike ubereats and other food apps that charge restaurants a fee per order bellevue bites lets the restaurant keep all the profits and provides a free promotional platform we hope to help the local economy grow along with the small businesses that make it unique thank you all right and how do i get into this app i guess i should click to find a restaurant near me to find a restaurant near you and then right now it's in the seattle moby area so let's say you're in seattle um so then now we have exclusive discounts with restaurants that are partnered with us and if you click on their logo you can be taken to the website for example um yeah so it'll go it'll take you eventually to the website and it's just a great way for small businesses to connect and a resource for people in the community well thank you so much for making this app and for doing your part to help small businesses deal with the crisis we're in uh these apps are all built on code.org lab uh and we are going to be by the end of this episode demoing how easy it is to make your own app uh hey sophie that app is awesome can i give you can i give you can i give you one piece of advice so on every single page that you create with an app and this is like this is the same advice like i i gave and i actually learned this from kevin sinstrom who created instagram uh and and what he always said to me about product when i was learning about product really early on he was like every single page of any app that you have you have one thing that you want the customer to do the most and and you have to make sure that that one thing you want the customer to do the most is the most prominent thing and the easiest thing for them to actually click and so it was funny when hadi was uh looking at your homepage he was had to kind of search for where to push right like what the first thing to click was because it was kind of hidden down in the bottom so you try to try to always think about like what do you what do you as the creator want the user to do on every single page and make sure that that is has some that is featured in some way that that makes them think oh i should probably push this yeah yeah yeah so it's more yeah i see what you're saying completely yeah awesome thank you great yeah sure so today we want to start today's lesson and what we're going to learn about is encryption so today's computer science word of the day is encryption uh thank you sophia for making this sound for us uh encryption is how we protect data by changing it into something secret that nobody else can figure out unless they decrypt it and we're going to learn one of the most simple ways to do this um but ashton i first want to ask what are some examples of why it's important to protect data whether you're when you're using any of the top web sites or apps in the world yeah i so so one of the first things is is that you know i'm everybody out there probably everybody on this call is a really good person that's trying to do really good things in the world and there are some people out there that are that don't have everybody's best intentions in mind and when our our information and our data is on different different services and there's all kinds of things that can be on on different services so like your what kind of phone you have where you're at when you're using your phone if you buy things and you put a credit card credit card information in in into your phone or onto a website all that information gets stored in databases and when we're communicating back and forth and when these websites are communicating back and forth if that data isn't safe and sometimes we let's say we go to uh you know a shopping platform and it's a brand new shopping platform it's only a very little company and you put your information in there if that company goes out of business sometimes other companies buy your information from that from that company and next thing you know you have somebody who you really don't you wouldn't give your credit card information to or somebody that you really wouldn't give personal information to now they've got your data and so making sure that that who we are where we are who our friends are what our banking or credit card information is is protected is really really important because once it's on the internet a lot of people can can steal it and take it and use it for for bad things to steal money from us to hurt people uh and and ultimately to pretend like they're you if they want to and then they can go to other websites pretending like they're you and and spend your money that way or ruin your reputation like imagine if somebody didn't really like you very much and they wanted to make you other people think that you were a bad person they could take your identity and use it on another platform and make you look like a really bad person by saying some really mean things to people and doing nasty stuff and we don't want to we don't want that to happen so today we're going to learn about a really simple form of encryption using a simple cipher known as a caesar cipher which was once used by emperor julius caesar in the roman empire ashton did you get the packet that we sent you this packet yeah it said don't open it until the live episode uh so i assume you'll see it still sealed it is encrypted at this point within this envelope all right so can you open it for us right now of course i can this is this is the most rudimentary form of encryption put it in a package ahha we have here a wheel do you have a wheel that's a caesar cipher that sophia made for you i did not you drew it we were supposed to say that you made it no you did all right fine i gave it up well i made it i even called out that beautiful flower to make it look like an 11 year old made it sofia was busy doing homework but what that wheel does you see two wheels inside each other and if you turn each one of them what it does is it can give you instructions to replace one letter of the alphabet with a different letter of the alphabet to basically encode a message or to encrypt a message what we're going to do is ashton is going to pick a secret message and he's going to use this wheel to encrypt it and i want you to choose a oneword message to make it really simple and pick a position on the wheel and and map from one letter to another to to create a secret message and our entire live audience is gonna try to decrypt your message all at the same time so while ashton is encrypting i'm gonna show some slides now for what we want everybody else to do so that you can basically decrypt ashton's message so whoever is there on the audience whether you're on camera or not take a look at my screen for what i want you all to do at just one second i'm sharing my screen just right now okay there we go all right can you see my screen so what ashton had there is a caesar cipher built in a wheel but what we're going to do is do it on paper so you're going to have an alphabet that looks like this but each one of you is going to have a different version of this just like turning one of the wheels so there's a different point in the alphabet mapping one letter to another letter and some of you will get lucky if you get the right key to match to what action encrypts with so what i want you to do is take a piece of paper turn it sideways and at the top of the piece of paper write the alphabet but plan ahead so you don't run out of space when sophia did this the first time she ran out of space that's better this time so write the letters a through z all across the top next you want to pick a letter between b and z this is your secret key it's like a password and you're trying to guess the secret key that ashton has picked after you pick your secret key write another alphabet directly below it starting at the letter you picked and letter by letter go underneath those ones and write all the other letters of the alphabet and when you reach the end of the page at z you want to start over yeah you want to start over at the letter a i'm going to give you a little bit of time to do this for the students who are in the audience and can i ask if you're in the audience trying to do this when you finish can you raise your hand so we have a sense that you're done before we go on to the next step so you're going to need to end up writing two alphabets and each of you is going to be choosing a different key all right my computer is getting a little overloaded from all these hands being raised wow all right so what as you're doing this i'm going to go through to explain what you're going to do next is ashton is going to say his secret message he's going to read it letter by letter as he does that you want to write that down lower down on your piece of paper and then for each letter that ashton reads you want to find that letter in the top row of your cipher and look at the letter right below it and write that letter right below in the message and that way you can translate and some of you one out of 25 of you will have picked the same secret key as ashton and you'll be able to decrypt his message so it's going to be a question of who gets lucky to decrypt his message everybody who's live on camera has been given a different secret key so we'll all be able to do this together at the same time and see which ones of us can decode ashton's message so ashton are you ready with your secret super double extra secret message i'm ready with my double extra super secret extra super duper duper the most secretist message of all ever to been created that was secret all right secret all right so can you read out the letters one by one and everybody write them down as ashton reads them are you ready yes r d i repeat r d as in duck s as in simon t as in top all right so those of you who are in the audience if you get the right answer we want you to actually can we lower the hands of everybody who's in the live in in the audience in the not on screen if you're on screen raise your hand let's switch to gallery view so we can see all the students at the same time and if you get the right answer please raise your hand and wave your hand and this is if you basically get a letter a word that you can can read and it's a real english word raise your hand and it looks like about 43 people in the entire audience or 47 people in the audience got the right answer and one student has raised their hand uh can you can we unmute him i think this is eat cass casts hello yeah so so the message is called code wow that's a great secret code where are you calling us from india wow and what was ashton's secret key in this case uh rdst let's see so we were able to so we were able to solve this as humans with only a thousand of us in just a minute and we didn't have only one person do the work we had all of us spreading the work multiple people doing it at the same time so some of us got lucky to solve solve it correctly that's using a computer science concept called distributed computing we spread the work we distributed the work with multiple people doing it at the same time but let's see how long it would take for a computer to decrypt a similar message what we're going to do now is we're going to have a a computer app that basically does the same kind of encryption that you all did but it does it much much faster and i'm going to demo this and then ashton is going to encrypt another message so ashton uh would you mind encrypting another message while i show this to everybody sure i'm on it right now all right thank you so much uh so this here is a widget on code.org and we're going to send this to the email where you can write a message so i'm going to write ashton's original message rdst and you can see the secret message here and over here it shows what each of these letters is being replaced with and then i can shift them one by one letter by letter to see a change with each mapping you can see these letters here shift and a different version of ashton's secret message and if we click enough times we get to the right answer which is code so we are going to now do this again with another secret message and for all of you sophia is going to use the computer here sophia are you ready yes and ashton if you could read out your secret message and again we want everybody to to write theirs and you're going to be racing against the computer which sophia is going to be using so asham let's let's hear your new message n r j y space p f l i space y r e u jay all right so now sophia is going to try to decrypt this using the computer while students in the live audience if anybody in the live audience gets it faster than sophia raise your hands if you get it faster than sophia wow there's already 15 people who raised their hands and beat the computer at doing this it's going lower and lower oh i think you passed it there's ashton's super secret message extremely secret ashton was this your message that was my message wash your hands wash your hands and it looks like your key was the letter no the little letter r why is it why is your secret message wash your hands well because right now with the coronavirus the best thing that we can all do for ourselves to keep ourselves safe and keep the people around us safe is wash our hands and so whenever we touch something or a surface that we think anybody else has touched like a doorknob or a handle in a bathroom or a faucet sink and faucet handle or a table or flat surface the best thing we can do is wash our hands because the one thing that we know about this coronavirus is that it does not like soap right so one thing we also saw is that a lot of students were even faster than sophia and the computer at decrypting ashton's message and that's partly because we use distributed computing it's also because the secret key action picked was just a letter from b through z it's like a password that's one letter long and there's only 25 options so it wasn't hard to crack but we're going to learn about stronger passwords soon as we learn more about encryption but before ashton leaves we want to give the audience one last chance to ask him a question we have the students who are live on camera submit a bunch of questions and i want to introduce dior dior cease are you there with us hi i just wanted to ask um what have you learned about success and what do you think would be helpful for students to know what have i learned about success um i think the biggest thing that i've learned is that doing great things is uncomfortable um it's it it when you work really hard it's uncomfortable and the more that you can do things that are uncomfortable and that are a little bit hard and that are a little bit of a stretch for you the more comfortable those things become and the next thing you know you're doing really really really hard things that you couldn't have imagined yourself doing and it seems easy um and and i think the biggest thing that i've learned through my my career and the advice that i would give myself if i was your age is that the people who are building the coolest things in the world and the people that you look up to and admire the most they're no smarter than you are they don't have some special gift they don't have some special thing that you don't you've got it too and you've got to believe that you've got it and the more that you believe that you've got it the cooler things the greater things that you'll build in this world and you'll be the person that builds the things that other people are looking at going wow how did she do that i wish i could be a little bit more like dior well thank you so much ashton for your time with us at i know we ran a little bit later than we expected i hope you stay healthy and safe can the audience all say goodbye to ashton let's switch to gallery so we can see everybody everybody say goodbye sophia do you want to hit a little sound thank you so much ashley oh thank you thank you i appreciate it i hope to talk to you all soon all right keep up the good work thank you byebye uh all right mia we're gonna switch to you as mia there i am here hello all right so mia used to work for the national security agency the nsa which is one of the top spy agencies in the world even while she was a college student uh studying computer science working for the nsa is like the cyber security equivalent of joining the navy seals it's like the ultimate elite uh so i first wanted to ask what did it take to get in so it's not as hard as it might seem there are obviously some security concerns so you need to make sure that you pass a clearance investigation you need to take a polygraph stuff like that but in terms of computer science knowledge really i just had to be willing to learn and willing to study computer science so at the time i was in college i was majoring in computer science with a focus in cyber security and a lot of the things that i did at my job i learned on the job there are things that they teach you there and um it's meant that it was a great opportunity to get to expand my knowledge past just what my college classes were teaching me great um well we spent a whole bunch of time encrypting secret messages and we used those with a password that was as little as you know going from b through z or single letter but now let's talk about real passwords uh what are some some tips you can give us for creating good passwords well you should definitely never say your real password allowed to anyone especially on a video call with you know a thousand people watching um but anyway hottie what's what's your password nice try let's not talk about my password but sophia what's your password you already know my password wait i'm not the whole message is you're not supposed to share your password don't tell people that i know your password you're supposed to say you don't i'm not going to tell you um but speaking about passwords mia what's the name of your favorite pet in the street you grew up on i'm not going to tell you that one either but jokes aside is it safe to use things like your favorite pet or the street you grew up on for security purposes it's not so for example i talk about my cats ponyboy and dr wisconsin who i love dearly all the time so anyone who knows me just a little bit will know that those are my pets names and that they can try to use that as a security question answer or as a password for any of my accounts i hope none of my friends would do that but they might so if all this information about us is is on the internet in social media and people can figure out things about us why are companies still using these types of things for security questions that's a really good question it's difficult because for security questions you're usually not going to be entering them very frequently so you probably won't remember them that's why it's much easier to use something that you'll never forget like your first cars make and model or your pet or the street you grew up on because these are things that are just you know ingrained in your memory and you won't forget them it's a constant sort of struggle between usability making sure that the system is usable and that you can give an answer versus security giving something that people would not be able to guess so one of the things we want to do is we want the audience to get take a guess at what is the best password to use or the safer password to use the harder one for a computer to guess so we're going to do a live interactive poll and show two password options and we want everybody to guess which is the more secure password which is harder for a computer to guess so could we put the poll up on the screen uh it's still not showing all right there i think we see it so everybody take a guess at which password is more secure azr at d percent one or cat dog house panda bear which of these is harder for a computer to guess all right we have almost half the audience has already taken your guesses all right let's show the results on the screen all right so what you can see is almost everybody guessed that this hard to read pronounced unpronounceable password is more secure it has symbols it has letters it has uppercase letters it has numbers mia what do you think so i think it's a lot harder for a human to maybe guess the first password the one that starts with an a but i think it'll be harder for a computer to guess the second password really so you think everybody's wrong or most everybody's wrong let's let's use an app built on code.org app lab to see which of these passwords is easier or harder so this app is a how secure is your password app and it basically measures how long it would take a computer to to crack a password so the first password we tried was a z 3 at sign d percent one and it says a computer would take two hours to crack this password just two hours which is a lot of time for a computer working uh do you remember the second password sophia what was it do you remember cat dog house panda bear house panda bear that was a much easier password to remember and it would take what is that number it's a big number six trillion trillion years for a computer to crack this password so it turns out mia was right about this and can i ask whether do people like the idea of having an app that measures how fast your password is if you want this app yourself this is the app it's built on app lab this is the code for the app you can see it but if anybody wants to check your own passwords at home if you have a phone you can scan this qr code right here hold your phone camera up to this qr code and the camera should pop up a little url so it will actually take you to the app if you click that notification and you can all type in your own secret passwords don't show it to somebody else but this app will tell you how strong your password is and how fast a computer would be able to crack it for you this is something i think all the adults on the screen and at home could also benefit from because all of us play a role in keeping our computers and our data safe so again you can scan the qr code we'll also send it to you via email as well i'm going to stop the screen share now so so mia why is it more secure to do that long password that had such easy words rather than this super strange one with with the symbols because for computers the thing that matters is how long the password is if you think about having a one character password there are 26 letters nine digits something like 13 special characters so there are you know maybe 50 options that can be that one character password if you have a two character password then you have 50 times 50 options because each character means you have to try everything from the characters before plus everything for that last character every time you add another character to your password it gets even harder it adds more so it's an exponentially increasing problem that means that when you make a password super super long it becomes almost impossible for a computer to use a reasonable amount of time to try to guess that password it has to try every single option before it can get to the one that you've chosen a lot of us have been learning about exponential growth and exponential numbers in the last few weeks uh when we're talking about the spread of a virus but with the length of a password exponential growth and exponential numbers make make the same difference as well before mia says goodbye to us we have time for asking one question so uh do we have questions from the audience uh akira do you have a i want to introduce akira gilbert from code.org she's basically producing code break behind the scenes to to share a question from the audience with us akira are you there hi i am how are you great thank you where are you calling from i'm calling from new york so it's been a great time so far the epicenter in the us all right so what's the question for mia um the question about the app is first of all is it safe to enter your password into a second party app which i think we can answer very well that's a great point you shouldn't enter your app or enter your password into second party apps uh usually because you don't want that app to store the password um in this case we can see the code that we're using for this app you can see that it doesn't store anything so you can be pretty sure that it's just going to calculate the amount of time that it'll take and then it throws it away it won't save it and no one will be able to access it sounds great thanks mia yeah all right yeah in general you should never type your password on a screen on a computer unless you see the lock in the browser without the lock there it's actually dangerous because that means anybody on the internet can read what you're typing whether it's a password or credit card anything it's open for the entire world to to tap into unless you see the lock in the browser all right mia thank you so much for your time and stay safe and healthy uh everybody say goodbye to mia thank you i hope all of you stay safe and healthy as well uh have fun enjoy the rest of this lesson all right thank you all right so next we're gonna switch to uh this week's trivia question it's trivia time so the question is what was the release year of the first commercial computer with a display screen we're gonna put a live pull up for people to see the options so you know all of our computers and phones and everywhere you see a computer right now they have a screen but the question is what was the first computer commercial computer that had a screen because before they didn't have screens uh when was the computer screen introduced there's four different choices we have up on screen uh and it's not obvious which one there is i'm watching the audience live guesses come in and they are all over the map ranging from 1945 all the way to 1976. right if we could put the audience guesses up on screen so it should shows uh some of you thought it was in 1945 the inayak computer this the anayak was a 27 ton computer that actually used punch cards with holes in them to represent information they didn't have screens at the time after the niacc they used paper tape uh to actually show basically the the results of what a computer was calculating would be shown on paper tape uh the correct answer let me share my screen so you can see a photo of this beauty is the pdp1 computer uh built in 1959 this entire thing you see on screen is this giant computer with all these wires and stuff behind it this computer today would fit in the size of a grain of sand almost and this here is the screen that it had this screen didn't have colors it only had one color to show it also couldn't even show words on screen it could only draw lines so if you use the artist app on code.org or logo or things like that we move forward turn left to draw lines that's the only thing it could do or in python or in python yes which sophia does but that's all it had as a screen so that's the answer for today's computer uh trivia question so now i want to switch to the last part of our episode the making of an app to make strong passwords we all saw how it's good to have strong passwords and you don't actually want to have passwords with weird symbols in them unless you can remember them and they're really long but actually the strongest passwords can just have a bunch of words so we're going to have a teacher and a student join us to make this so the the teacher is katie o'brien katie are you there with us hi yes i am so katie uh used to be a math teacher and she decided to teach computer science and code.org put her through training to learn to become a computer science teacher she loved it so much that then she started training and preparing other computer science teachers and we loved her work so much that then she joined the code.org team to help run the professional learning program that is teaching computer science to teachers all around the country over 100 000 new computer science teachers have gone through this training so she's going to introduce a student at yes we have nina with us hello nina where are you from i'm from the twin cities in minnesota twin cities in minnesota and you took our cs principles class with code.org last year is that right i did great did you like it i did like the class it was one of the most enjoyable classes i took last year that's awesome yes cs principles has now become the most popular computer science class in the in high schools all around the country so for any student out there who's in high school i encourage you to take cs principles if your school offers it and if your school doesn't offer it please ask the principal to add it to the school calendar so now let's build our app to make strong passwords katie are you ready can you walk us through it and have me yeah nina's gonna screen share for us and she's gonna actually build it out of herself you know you ready to share your screen got it awesome all right so nina here is in a blank app um there's nothing there um and we're gonna just kind of show you how to get some of the user interface or the ui set up so nina will you switch into design mode here we are all right fantastic um and she's gonna drag over some of the design toolbox elements let's just do a button and a label for right now here we have the button and the label fantastic now she can very easily change how it looks by changing the theme of the app she could also change the individual colors to make it something she likes but if you click on the background nina and then select a few different themes that you think are interesting okay let's see what we got let's go let's see what robot looks like okay it's not my favorite yeah okay let's what's another what's another uh you know ketchup and mustard really call in my name that seems like a winner i like that yeah all right so we can do all sorts of different themes in there um so that's design mode in app lab but it's not where we're going to be working today we're going to be working in code mode so um nina can you go to our app that we are designing here it is all right excellent and it looks like we have a little bit of extra stuff on the screen we're just going to ignore that for right now no idea what it is that's okay uh so here we've got our user l interface on the left hand side all set up for us already um and we have a list of words that we might use in our password if you're a panelist who's on the screen right now can you click on the chat in the right hand corner and type some words that you think we should have included in our word list for our passwords so i'm seeing baby nina do you want to add that frog i can't spell oh my gosh okay baby yep let's do frogs oh my god okay and jellyfish oh jellyfish jellyfish are so cool all right so we just added a few more things to our word list here um and we're going to want the app to make a password for us when we hit click me so for that we're going to need an event handler you know we drag one of those out from us for us there we go great and then you're going to switch it so that when they click on the click me button this stuff will happen whatever we tell the computer we want it to do there we go awesome great um from there we're going to want the computer to take some information from the user we're going to want it to take the number of words in the password which is going to be shown by the slider and then we're going to want to have it create a password so nina can you make two new variables for me please one for the number of words and one for our new password okay so let's make a password and this is going to be which we call it word number yeah that's good all right great um and so our word number is going to be give got or we're going to get our word number from the slider there so why don't you go ahead and get number and we're going to get it from that slider and then our password we don't have it yet so we're just going to give it an empty string so we're just going to do quote unquote great all right thanks nina all right you know so next we need to make our new password and so we wanted to add things to this password over and over again from our word list so what are we going to need to use if we want to do something over and over again in our code we are going to want a loop excellent gonna grab our loop for us all right yeah all right so our loop is going to run um some number of times and we want it to run as often as we want that like password link to be or the number of words in our password to be so um what's going to go there instead of four because we don't want it to run necessarily four times we can reference the word number variable yeah so we want it to run a word number times all right um and so now let's go ahead and let's build our password so every time we go through this loop we want to add something new to our password so we're going to update the value stored in password and let's switch over to text mode for this i think that might be easy for us easier for us nina i agree all right so uh we're gonna update this password so it takes our old password and it adds to it a random word from our word list so in order to get a random word from our word list we have to get a random number the reason for that is is because every single item in our list has a number associated with it so for example apple is the first item in the list just like you write out a grocery list it's the first one but it's actual number associated with with it is zero so we're going to want to get a random element from that list that starts at zero to the very end so um to access that uh value good nina you got it you got the word list and we're going to want to access the element at a random number so uh wordless square bracket 0 to ran yeah wait yup you got it yeah so you have to make sure i think we want the random number first yeah random number parenthesis and then we want to go to the end of the list because we might want to add more words in here so we're going to do wordlist.length and uh we're gonna do minus one because we don't wanna go off the length of our list good all right let's uh yeah we can go back to blocks i think that's a good idea looks like everything's good all right let's go ahead and run our program and test it out okay moment of truth will she work okay we're gonna do like threeish words okay password and nothing happened okay why do you think that is nina we never told our program to put anything on the screen to tell us what our password is exactly so we maybe did update the password but it's just not showing up on the screen so the user can't see it at all so let's set the text of that text area to be our new password area is called password output and we're going to set it to password excellent so that's going to take what's stored in password and throw it on the screen for us all right now let's test it okay second try three words sounds good okay and password jellyfish frog apple it's a password let's try it again make sure it still works click it baby apple sloth i kind of like that one baby apple sloth yeah i'm sure a computer would have a hard time guessing it yeah um and yeah you want to try the slider too to make sure it works yes let's go let's go five words max it out okay frog jellyfish apple baby jellyfish that would take me a while to type out but it would be a stronger password for sure okay thanks nina um you'll see that the possible passwords is left blank that's going to be a challenge for the rest of the audience to do for uh on your own time so we'll finish that a little bit later but i think we've have a really good start to our app thanks nina thank you thank you so much nina and katie uh so that app that we just built on the fly lets you create your own password but it only had uh seven or eight words in it uh and i actually made a copy of nina's app right now because any of you might want to actually make your passwords a little stronger this version of this app right now it has a word list of 1200 simple words in it that we downloaded from the internet i basically copied nina's code and then added many more words so this is the same exact app but you can have it generate a password of five words uh land rogue patch chute mocha and it can basically make passwords for you if you want this uh you can scan this qr code and have it on your own phone and make strong passwords from now on that are easy to remember and we're actually going gonna use this app for the challenges for this week and so that gets us to this week's challenges uh we want you to try to use this app and improve on it and there's a number of ways you can do that uh so if you enjoyed this show what we want you to do is to take a look at this week's challenges which will send you an email if you haven't signed up already enter your email address at code.org break if you do that within the next hour we'll send you this week's challenges and then what those challenges are going to include a bunch of things first of all you get to get a piece of paper uh that you can print out to make a caesar cipher widget just like ashton kutcher had for the younger kids you can then actually make your own secret messages and make and basically share them with a sibling or with your mom and dad and have one of you make a message and one of you try to decode that message for the younger kids that's lots of fun sophia and her brother yes sophia and her brother didn't spend all weekend doing this and if you're a little more uh interested in trying one of the harder challenges what you can do is take the app that we just got that we uh that nina built for us and add a bunch of improvements to it as we can improve the interface we can basically count how many types of passwords or how hard a password is to crack one of the challenges is to show uh whether a password is weak or strong depending on the password that was created so please to get each week's challenges sign up with your email at code.org break and what we're going to do like we just did this week is whoever sends us in uh what they created we're going to showcase on the show next week with next week's special guest whether that's if you created its super cool secret message that you want us to encrypt or whether you made a really nice version of an improvement on nina's app lastly if you have feedback on how we can improve please fill out the survey that we send you an email as well if you enjoyed this show please spread the word about code break we want each of us every person here to invite at least one other or two other families to join us next week to to hopefully grow the the code break audience each week i want to say as we part ways thank you to all of our students on camera so if we could switch to gallery mode and everybody wave your hands we're done with today's code break thank you so much and extra special thanks to our special guests uh ashton kutcher and mia gil eppinger if you're studying alone take a code break thank you everybody and have a wonderful day hmm you
