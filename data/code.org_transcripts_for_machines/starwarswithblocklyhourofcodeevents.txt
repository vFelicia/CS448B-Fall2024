Well, hello, my name is Charita Carter. I'm a senior creative producer here at Walt Disney Imagineering. I'm responsible for leading teams that actually produce the attractions that our guests get to experience. We are always looking for ways that we can improve and make a better experience for our guests and technology is at the heart of that. Congratulations, you did it! You programmed BB8. Now I think we're ready for something harder. Let's go for it. Now that you've learned the basics of programming, we're going to back in time to build your own game, starring R2D2 and C3PO. To make a game, we need to learn about something that game programmers use every day they're called events. Events tell your program to listen or wait for when something happens and then when it does, it performs an action. Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click, an arrow button or a tap on the screen. Here we're going to make R2D2 move up to deliver a message to a rebel pilot and then move down to the other rebel pilot. We'll use events to make him move. When the player uses the up/down arrow keys, or the up/down buttons. We use the when up event block and attach the go up block to it. When the player presses the up arrow key, the code attached to the when up block is run. And we'll do the same thing to make R2D2 move down. Now instead of writing all the code to control our droid in advance, we can let R2D2 react to button press events that move him around the screen. Step by step, your game is getting more interactive.
