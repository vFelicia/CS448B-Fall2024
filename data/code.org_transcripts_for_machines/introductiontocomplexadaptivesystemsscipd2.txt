hi everybody I'm John P Gonzalez a facilitator with project guts in Santa Fe New Mexico in this video you'll learn about complex adaptive systems a type of scientific phenomena that will be modeling and investigating through the code.org mscs and science modules have you ever wondered how thousands of Birds move in amazing patterns like this ever watched fish schooling and wondered how they coordinate their movements when you're looking at a flock of birds or a school of fish you're watching the behavior of a system of many interacting parts in this case individual birds or individual fish are the parts systems where unexpected patterns emerge as a result of many individual Parts interacting are called complex systems the study of complex systems has recently recognized as a new type of science the living world is a great place to find examples of complex systems where the actions of individuals turn into the behaviors of a group this bird flock is an example of a complex system in action to understand how any complex system works it's important to answer two basic questions how do each of the parts of the system behave for example how does each Bird In A Flock behave and how do the parts act together to form the behavior of the whole system for example how do individual birds in a flock act together to form beautiful flying patterns let's look at the first question how does each bird in the flock behave believe it or not every bird in the flock is following the same three Simple Rules stay close to but don't bump into the birds around me fly as fast as the birds near me and move towards the center of the group now for the second question how do the individual birds in a flock act together to form these beautiful flying patterns you might think there is one leader bird who is somehow sending messages to tell other birds in the flock where to fly but really it's much less complicated than that when hundreds or thousands of birds each follow the same three rules amazing flocking patterns emerge sometimes even if you can figure out how each individual ual in a complex system behaves it's really hard to predict how a system as a whole will behave or what types of patterns will emerge when many individuals are all acting at the same time this is where the power of computer simulations comes in agentbased computer models and simulations are great tools to visualize and explore group behaviors for example in this simulation of fish interacting with algae in a pond every yellow fish you see is programmed to follow the same simple rules for movement getting energy by eating algae reproduction and death the algae is also programmed to follow simple rules for reproduction and death once the behavior of these two types of individuals and the interactions between them has been programmed the simulation can then populate a virtual world with tens hundreds or even thousands of fish in algae all following their assign rules at the same time using computer models like this helps people observe what happens at the level of the system or in this case the simulated ecosystem other than the fact that they're really cool why is understanding complex systems important biologists physicists Engineers mathematicians and social scientists are finding that the rules that create ordered systems from Individual behaviors are showing up in many fields and at many different scales complex systems arise from the behavior of molecules in our bodies of bird flocks or even from human interactions like crowds and traffic jams they're also finding that understanding the way individual Parts work together may be just as important as understanding the way that they work alone
