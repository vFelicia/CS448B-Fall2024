a constant is a variable containing a value that cannot be changed the ability to have a value that can never be modified is very useful one great example is the value of pi pi never changes it is what it is many of science's greatest accomplishments came as a result of being able to depend on a constant like pi if a calculation is made with a slightly different value of pi things could go drastically wrong in programming a constant allows us to create a variable that we can rely on to give consistent answers just like pie does we can create our own constants using the keyword final first write final then the data type then the name of the variable when a variable has the keyword final it is now a constant the program can't give it a new value constants follow a new naming rule write the variable name in all caps separating words by using underscores if necessary for example if we have a bakery with a fixed cost for the cookies we are selling we would create a constant by writing final double sugar underscore cookie underscore price equals 2.19 the value of sugar cookie price can't change in our code sugar cookie price now has a constant value of 2.19 we can then use the sugar cookie price constant variable anywhere we want to use the price like if we wanted to calculate a customer's total order if we try to change the value of a constant like our sugar cookie price we get an error this is a good thing it means we can count on any final variable having the exact same value that it was initially assigned final variables can also be static this means they can be accessed by any instance of a class at this bakery we have a child discount on all cookies which are instances of a cookie class no matter what cookie a child buys it will cost we can set that variable to be static and final we can now create constants using the keyword final wherever necessary you
