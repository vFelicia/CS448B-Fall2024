foreign question multiple choice quiz to their students just think about all of the data that the teacher would have for example let's say Amanda's answers are a c d c d Brian responds like this here is Cindy's quiz and finally Daniels each of these quizzes represents a 1D array of individual answer choices if we create an array of these arrays we get a two dimensional array a twodimensional array is a data structure made up of an array of arrays we call this 2D for short it is often represented as a table with rows and columns CRA consists of an outer array and multiple inner Arrow arrays the other array is a onedimensional array each position in this array contains a pointer to its respective inner array the inner arrays are also onedimensional arrays these inner arrays contain the actual values we want to store good at 2D array is a table we can refer to each inner array as a row a row is a series of data that runs horizontally from left to right each row contains the quiz scores for a specific student the indexes for these onedimensional arrays start at zero column is a series of data that runs vertically from top to bottom The Columns represent the answer choices for each question column indexes also started as zero here's our table written as a 2d array in this case the array was initialized with the starting values because these values are text we use the string data type notice the twodimensional arrays use double square brackets after the data type we can access and modify elements in a 2d array in the same way that you can with 1D arrays threedimensional arrays allows us to group together several similar arrays we can use just one data structure with its one identifier to store and access many values
