i like challenging things that's what i like about computer science it challenges me programming's fun and easy you can do anything your mind wants to do this is the game i made meteor fall it feels nice like wow i created this this is mine don't just play on your phone program i liked how like we had creative freedom so we could have made any game that we wanted but i definitely thought that computer science meant that i was going to be sitting at a desk looking at a computer screen typing for hours and hours this class is really fun and it applies to like almost everything because we use computers for everything i plan to use the things i learned in computer science to really incorporate artificial intelligence with medicine i would like to solve problems in fields like education and music and publishing and you can actually make your own world the computer science whether you're a young man or a young woman whether you live in a city or a rural area computers are going to be a big part of your future and if you're willing to work and study hard that future is yours to shape so sign up for computer science at your school and prepare to change your life
