hi i'm senator cory booker and i just finished a few lines of code i participated in an hour of code i'm senator bob casey and i just completed writing a few lines of code i appreciate the opportunity to support what's called the hour of code which is a global initiative anyone can learn computer science if we want america to stay on the cutting edge we need young americans like you to master the tools and technology that will change the way we do just about everything make sure that every american understands a lot more about computing thousands of jobs remain unfilled because our k12 classrooms haven't provided ample opportunities to learn computer science computer science is the highest paid college degree today with the number of jobs available growing at twice the rate of the national average and if we don't increase access to computer science education now these jobs will either remain unfilled or employers will find workers overseas exporting those jobs or importing the labor to fill them whether you're a young man or a young woman whether you live in a city or a rural area computers are going to be a big part of your future and if you're willing to work and study hard that future is yours to shape
