hello everyone my name is leoland bowen and i work on the educations programs team here at code.org thank you for joining us for our first my journey class chat and thank you taylor roper who is joining us from google hey taylor so taylor my first question is for you and for those watching at home or in your class please feel free to answer this question as well out loud or put it in the chat box taylor if you were an ice cream flavor what flavor would you be that's a great question um i think i would be vanilla with a caramel swirl um because vanilla is very versatile you can put it with a lot of other different flavors but it's also really simple and like classy in its own sense um and then the caramel swirl adds a little razzle dazzle adds a little fun to the mix and adds like a really nice additional flavor i love it that sounds great yummy thank you first thing i want to think about in the morning is ice cream yes so taylor tell us about your work what do you do yes so i'm a program manager and so essentially what that means if i solve business problems and i know that can sound really really big and vague but it's what we do and it can be any kind of problem so if my team is having a problem with communicating with others i might create a newsletter or if there's a program that needs to be run i might manage having to schedule meetings or talk to people or take notes or create documents that help people understand what the project is about um and program managers can sit on a variety of different products so if you've ever heard of google search or google pixel or youtube there are definitely program managers like myself working on those products to help make them better efficient and more helpful to users that sounds so fun um can you tell us a little bit more about specifically what a.i is and how does that work help your community yeah so hopefully no computer scientists watch this and like she got it wrong but essentially artificial intelligence from my perspective is when we give technology or computers the ability to do tasks like humans so like us um and also make decisions and i think the decisionmaking part where a computer can say is this a cat or a dog and it says yes and then it does something else with it is what makes artificial intelligence artificial intelligence and how it helps um my community is that it just makes a lot of different things easier i mean there are disabled people in my community who are able to use things like the lookout app which helps identify helps people who have vision disabilities identify different objects around them you have google translate which allows people who may have a language barrier to communicate via technology you have google search which gives people an access to a whole lot of information that decades ago was not available to a lot of people my parents always talk about how i use google maps and they don't understand how i would navigate in the world if i didn't have google maps right so all of these different artificial intelligence technologies are really helpful for people and really help people really make tasks that people deal with on a daytoday basis easier i love google maps as well in the same way just i just give me the address and google maps will tell me and tell me how to get there exactly my mom's like i don't know how you would survive in this world you don't know any streets i'm like i have my phone right that's all you need so um what do you really really enjoy about working for google and being a program manager yes um so i work in the responsible ai space so my job is all about when these technologies happen sometimes we have accidents right sometimes we accidentally harm someone or sometimes we actually do something bad that we didn't necessarily intend to do but it happens and so the question is what do we do we typically want to apologize and fix the behavior and make it better right and so in response to ai sometimes there are different harms or biases that we call which means that that the technology doesn't work for everyone so for example if you ever have taken a photo on a cell phone be a pixel be an iphone we do have iphones here um and you've ever had seen a little box that focuses on someone's face it's called autofocus right and historically that has not worked for darker skinned people because there was a bias in the data set where they didn't have enough data of darker skin people to make sure that the technology worked on them also if you've ever put your hands on their hand sanitizer dispenser and the hand sanitizer came out on your hand that's another example of artificial intelligence and again darker skin tones have seen a lot more trouble with it so someone might put their hand under it and it doesn't work because the ai does not recognize the skin tone um and there's also youtube with like recommendations right so if you've ever watched a youtube video and you've seen that little thing where it's like autoplay and the another video comes up like 10 seconds later or you go on a home screen and you see all these recommended videos for you that's also artificial intelligence and so all of these things are made to help people but sometimes they don't and so my job is to make sure that the products being created are um are are being tested to you to be used for um people and for all people and that they're they're you being and that they work equally for all people and so i think that was one of the biggest things that really attracted me to working at google was the fact that there was this team that existed there was a space that existed where i was able to help a lot of people who sometimes are often um forgotten about or unintentionally left out of different kinds of tests or um collections etc and um i love being a program manager because it allows me to do a diverse set of things right i talked about how i'm able to schedule meetings and take notes and that might not seem as exciting but it's really important because when someone needs to find out what happened in a meeting they'd have to look at my notes i've also worked on creating classes i'm also currently running an office hours program which helps people is similar to like a a tutoring program where people can come for help and so i get to do all these really diverse kind of tasks that don't always fit into one bucket and that diversity and that consistent challenge of being able to just do something new within my um job role is really awesome for me thank you for that i've had that experience of doing this because the soap dispenser doesn't recognize exactly my exactly perfect well um i know there's a lot of uh kiddos here from classrooms all across the country who are very interested in either working at google or working in a.i um and before i ask the next question i just want to remind everyone if you do have questions yourself that you'll love taylor to ask about her her work in general please feel free to put it in the chat box we should have some time at the end to get to at least one or two of those questions so if there's a kiddo watching right now um who's like this sounds cool or i would love to you know learn more about or maybe i might myself want to work at google when i get older um what are some of the skills or abilities that they can start working on now yeah so there's a lot and i think the cool thing about being a program manager was some of the skill sets i already experienced from just being in class right so for example i often have to meet deadlines now they're not explicitly called deadlines at work it's more like oh this needs to be done by quarter two but essentially that's a deadline and that's very very similar to like your teacher giving you homework right and you have this assignment that you know you need to do even if it's the next day the next week the next month um and so meeting that homework deadline is the exact same thing that i have to do with meeting my project deadlines um and where your teacher will come in and say hey did you do the homework how did you do and evaluate your performance my boss is the same thing where it's like hey did you finish the project what does the metrics look like was it successful and to be clear it's okay if it wasn't successful in projects um because you always learn right and another thing is like sitting in meetings i have to sit in meetings all the time take notes and be active so similar to how you have to sit in your classroom and sometimes the teacher may ask a question right or you may be having a discussion it's the same exact thing where i am sitting down thinking listening to what's being told and then answering questions or giving my own opinion and then also going into giving opinions it's very much about communication that's a huge part of my job is being able to talk to different people resolve conflict so if you've ever had a disagreement with someone or someone said something that you really didn't like and you were like oh that makes me so angry i've been there and done that you have to learn how to accept the fact that people have different opinions right and those different opinions are not necessarily bad they're just different from yours and so learning how to really hear what people are saying and not just react to the fact that i don't like it and really take in what they're trying to say and figure out how i can join my opinion and their opinions together to create a really great solution for users and so these are just some of the things that um i have to do i do literally every single day that you probably do and you don't even realize it so you could really think to yourself wow i'm i'm acting like a program manager right now and i would wholeheartedly agree with that [Laughter] yeah and i know that it um when you tell people you work at google um i know that it sounds really exciting and it seems really fun to do but are there any hard parts of working at google any obstacles that you face in your role and if so how do you how do you approach them how do you think about them so they turn out positively definitely so google is a very big company like a hundred thousand plus people i don't know if you can imagine that i can't imagine that so um but just know that there's a lot of people with a lot of teams and so it can be difficult to get a good understanding of what's going on because you have to talk to so many different people and then again with this whole conflict resolution thing wow sometimes you really do want to be able to come to this compromise it can be very difficult and so learning how to deal with people who don't necessarily want to work with you or who don't always agree with you or who have other priorities too right because what i find important may not be what someone else finds important and so figuring out how to how we call a game buyin or get people's in gets get people to be interested in a project that can also be an extremely difficult task and so um those are just a few of the things also i started during the pandemic and so i actually have never met any of my coworkers in person and so i think at the beginning when i first started working that was definitely a conflict i had to learn how to get over was the fact that i had to get to know all these amazing people but i couldn't actually meet them my manager lives in california i'm in chicago i have coworkers in new york i have coworkers in ireland and london so it's really difficult to get us all together and so yeah just having a lot of people having to deal with conflict resolution that's a huge one too and then also having what we call a distributed team which means that everyone lives in a bunch of different places and not really in one in one city together yeah i can definitely understand that i'm in austin texas my manager is on the west coast and in seattle a lot of my poor definitely um can understand that so my second silly question getting to the tough ones um okay which cartoon character do you wish was real oh let's see i feel like i have to go with my favorite cartoon character which is um stitch and i pull out my little like airpods case because it's a little stitch um stitch is like my favorite cartoon character i feel like he's really misunderstood and sometimes he causes trouble but he has a really good heart and he really is trying to make good decisions and be nice to people and the last time i watched lilo and stitch i cried because it touched my heartstrings so much so i think i would love to meet stitch yeah he's so cute i agree i like that one i love that one yeah um okay so we're gonna take our first audience question okay so the question is what is your favorite project that you're currently working on my favorite project i'm currently working on i have to like go through my catalog of projects um so i can't go into too much detail but the one of my main programs is that um is like this office hours program and i love it because um it's literally all about helping people and that was another thing that really drew me to my team google was the fact that this team that i've been working on was really um oriented or focused on helping people and so um and then office hours i just got to learn about all these different teams going to meet all these different people going to learn all about all the really cool things that people are working on in the company and then i also just get to help them and so that's that's always great is to like be in a meeting and have people giving advice and have someone say like this is really helpful this really answered my question i'm so glad i came like that makes my world [Laughter] yeah that sounds fun i like that thank you for sharing that um so when you were little what did you want to be when you grew up and why so um let's do this in phases so when i was like let's say four to maybe seven or eight i really wanted to be a star and a star encompassed being an actress a singer slash pop star and a princess um and halfway had a hold on my life with princess diaries and then once i grew out of that and the color pink um i wanted to be a lawyer um or and slash or a teacher i've really always had a bunch of just really diverse interests i want to be a lawyer because i like sharing my opinion and i also like arguing in like a very healthy constructive way um and i always found like debates and kind of arguing different points and bringing up kind of like deconstructing someone's argument all these different things i found them really entertaining um and in fact one of my teachers actually gave me like a book of the constitution because she was like i think you're going to go into law and then i want to be a teacher because again going back to that whole thing of my love for helping people it's like i really enjoyed that i was able to be a tutor when i was in high school and i just loved um helping people understand a concept that really seemed insurmountable really difficult to understand and kind of breaking it down and using being creative and how i broke it down right to someone like sports to someone like video games like how can i bring in their interests to help them understand this concept and once they did it was always just again the most satisfying feeling to know that someone who felt really bad felt that they couldn't understand something is now able to understand something um and i've also just had some really great teachers in my life um who have really like changed my life and so the fact that they changed my life i think being a teacher is like this amazing job where you're really able to touch a bunch of different lives and help people and really pour into people um and i just love that so even as a little kid i was like i want to be a teacher and so um those are the those are the reasons why so from star to princess to lawyer to teacher to google how how did that um how did you end up at google from that journey like why did you end up deciding to work um specifically at google specifically as a project uh program manager from all the other great things that you could have done yeah so it started when i was little i also have an older brother and i think he also played a part in that because everything that he was interested i was also kind of interested in so he liked a lot of video game systems like the gamecube the nintendo wii we also had dvd players and so um always learning how to like switch the systems and plug in the dvd player and then go back to the to the gamecube and learning how to just really be around technology with something i did at a very young age and then as i got older i became tech support for my family so any questions related to technology of how do i plug this and how do i undo this how do i they always were coming to me or my brother and even to this day i'm still tech support for my family especially since i work at google and then in high school i took a web design course and i loved it i loved being able to design things choose the colors construct the page and the fact that i was able to see it happening in real time so i could make a difference save it and then i could see it literally on the web page it was kind of like this process of being able to instant gratification where i was able to do something solve a problem see the result solve a problem see the result and that was really satisfying to me and so i thought to myself hmm i like this i should do this for like a major and so i was considering computer science and business but then someone was like you should look into information systems and at my school i went to howard university in dc um information system sits in the school business and so i was like well it has business with a little bit of tech and that's exactly what i wanted and so i went there um and then how i got to google is another long story but essentially i um did a program with google called google tech exchange i was there for my entire junior year so about nine months and then i did an internship at google and an internship is essentially where you work at a company but it's a temporary employment so you're not fully there you're not permanently there and it's usually for a set amount of time so i did a bunch of summer internships when i was in college and they were all around three months and so i interned with google on the same team ml fairness now known as responsibly i and um then i got converted to full time meaning that google asked me to come back to them to work for them full time and i accepted that and um so that's kind of my journey and i don't actually know if i will be a lawyer or teacher like none of my dreams are really off maybe the actress and pops are off the table i don't think that's going to happen but i definitely see i definitely see the possibility of being a lawyer or teacher later on in my future and that's kind of something i'm also learning how to do is like how do i make all my dreams possible i may not be able to do them all at once right that doesn't mean i have to give up my dreams i just have to figure out how i can go from one thing to the other or figure out a way to teach while i'm at google or figure out a way to work with legal um cases while i'm at google you know just figure out how to incorporate all my different dreams so that i don't feel like i'm giving up on anything like i'm still able to do what i wanted to do yeah i love that of you know where we have so many different interests as people um and the idea that you don't have to give give it up give one thing up um as we get older i love that um so this next this is the audience question and i'm wondering if my son wrote this one in or not because the obvious question is do you do you help make video games do i help make video games no i'm sorry i'm sorry i don't i play them i play animal crossing i play um gosh i don't remember the other one but i do i do play them um but no i don't i don't think i'm like looking back to think if i've created any video games or i've worked with any teams making video games and the answer is no okay but i'm i i'm pretty sure there's a program manager out there that works along there so all to say even if i don't do it someone else in my role probably that's it okay give a lot of a lot of people high hopes for that [Laughter] um so were there people that helped you in your life that helped you along the way to google in what way and if so in what ways did they help you yeah so i knew this question was coming so i wrote on a list so to make sure to make sure i distracted my thoughts so first of all i i'm i'm christian so i thank god first right like that was probably kept me blessed me all that thank him the second was my family right they really taught me to challenge myself to put myself my best foot forward they were also there to kind of keep me there when i wasn't so if i wasn't doing my homework nudging me like hey do your homework like this is important you're learning things um but also just supporting me my family has been always been super supportive of like everything that i've done and it has really allowed me to kind of do what i want to do in terms of interests and majors i was never really pressured to go to specific school or choose a specific major um next we're gonna get into like my teacher so first one was mrs graham i don't know if she if she saw this she would remember me but she was my teacher from sixth to eighth grade and she taught me english and advanced literature and from her class i really learned how to like think critically but also ask questions and especially in my job especially in this world like it's really important to ask questions and to not be afraid to ask questions and so i really learned how to ask questions and really um question things and question literature and writing and why do we do this how do we do this this way why is it important things of that nature then i have mrs g who is my social studies and science teacher and she's actually the person that gave me the law the constitution and she was just really supportive and i think she saw the potential in me and i remember when i left that middle school um she was just like i know you're going to go very far and like that's always a really warm thing to hear from a teacher and then i had my dean i went to high school i went to a boarding school and a boarding school is essentially where it's like college but for high school so i was living away from my home when i was in high school and i had my dean of the dormitory i was saying and her name is dean jones and she really taught me kind of to have confidence in myself and my abilities and and my and just my being and so when i'm saying something be confident that i know what i'm talking about or when someone does me wrong like don't be afraid to say hey i don't i didn't appreciate that or that really hurt my feelings and being ok and knowing that my feelings are valid in that situation then we have miss nash and i went to high when i went to college and she was just there to really tell me to take ownership of my life right take ownership of my decisions um take risks i think sometimes we're afraid of risks or doing things that we don't know if they're going to be good or not we don't know the the the outcome and risks are perfectly fine because you're going to learn even if if you don't succeed like there's going to be a lesson in anything that you do and so she was really there to support me when i was trying to do something risky and everyone was like don't do it she was like do it she's like if it doesn't work out it's okay like it's not the end of the world um then we have like dr b and dr three c they were also college professors and they were just really supportive too always encouraging me um always trying to help coach me around how to think and like where to especially when i was came to like fulltime offers and getting a job outside of college that was that was a really important decision to make and they were definitely some of my counselors that i used and then now as a employee at google i have an amazing manager and amazing mentors who honestly are like safe spaces for me to really just talking about my feelings i can ask questions if i'm blocked on something i can ask for their advice and so all to say i have and there's so many more people that i didn't mention there have been so many people teachers faculty staff um even people who didn't work at the same company or didn't really know like there have been so many people who have definitely influenced my life and have definitely supported me um to help me become the person that i am today and the person that i'm becoming in the future so longwinded answer but all to say yes no that's that's true i i have a i love writing and i remember i had my it was my third grade teacher who was the first person that was like this poem that you wrote was really good and as an adult i still remember that all this time later yes it sticks with you yeah yeah thank you um so you said a little bit earlier that you are still the um the tech support for your family at what age were you when you started working on computers and um programming if you if you've done any sort of programming yeah i don't think i really ever i i even after graduating high school i don't really think i really understood programming but definitely computers i think i got my first desktop when i was really young i remember having an email address at like six and it was like an aol one and then my mom and i had to go through my mom and then you heard the dial up and then i was like wait and i was like what does this sound and yeah so i had my first email um when i was around five or six and i emailed my cousin so that was like the first that was like my first introductory to email and then my brother and i both got computers so probably around six or seven five six or seven like that was kind of the time where i started having a desktop and then once i started really getting into like how computers work and problem solving was probably around like eight nine ten um but since i had it i was always just kind of curious and clicking things and like oh look at this paint app i can draw things or look at solitaire how do i play this um or the pinball game all of those were yeah i was so from a very young from a pretty young age i was i was definitely using technology i at least had an email address well at six who were you emailing me yeah my cousin um i remember there was like the whole situation with my family and i just want to tell my cousin that i supported her and i didn't agree with that what any of the dolls were saying that i still loved her and i thought she was so wonderful and i'm not mistaken that was my very first email and then my grandmother to this day still sends me a lot of email so if no one else was emailing me my grandmother was [Laughter] yes yes gotta love grandmas [Laughter] so for our last question this is the last silly question that we have and actually came from one of our audience members who are watching if you had a super power what would it be this was an icebreaker question for a for a presentation that i had to give so this is really exciting that's a great question um so my answer and when i when we asked this was like repelling mosquitoes um which doesn't seem like a really important one but i get a lot of mosquito bites um but if i had to choose let's see one i think i said um maybe something around like traveling i want to say i want to marry like speaking every language and then also being able to teleport um so i love languages i love learning languages um i took like korean and french and spanish all throughout like my at different points in my life and so um i would love to just be able to like know all the languages and speak them that would be so cool and then yeah being able to teleport anywhere so i can actually use this skill would be amazing so dealing with like language language teleportation i don't know if that's something or being able to teleport teleport to a country and automatically understand the language i think that may be a smoother ride that's why i love the google translate function just for that same reason well thank you so much taylor for joining us today it was really great to hear about your experiences and working at google teachers thank you all as well for joining us please fill out the survey that you will receive from us via email tomorrow and be sure to check out the other class chats in virtual field trips at code.org cs journeys they're happening all semester long thank you everyone thank you everyone have a great rest your day
