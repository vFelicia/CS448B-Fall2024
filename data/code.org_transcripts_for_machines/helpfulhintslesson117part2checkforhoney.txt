so how do we solve this puzzle i'm going to show you in a very simple way like we've done before we're going to keep moving as long as there's a path ahead so while path ahead move forward at the end of that path we are going to check underneath the cloud to see if you're at a honeycomb if you are at a honeycomb then you'll make honey that will get you all the way to the end check underneath the cloud for honeycomb and if there's a honeycomb there you will make honey one time now notice that if you were to put this whole block inside wall path ahead it would check every space until you get to the end of the path including the one at the end that's fine too either way works now i've helped you do half the puzzle how do you do the rest i know you can figure it out happy coding
