hello everyone out there welcome to code.org cs journeys class chat my name is pat youngpraddit and i'm code.org's chief academic officer i'm here in maryland and i want to welcome our panelists today anna and ava from irobot anna ava why don't you say hi hello hi good morning everyone we are gonna start with a fun icebreaker all right kids um and uh our panelists don't know what the icebreaker is so this is totally impromptu and what we're going to do is we're going to play a game of would you rather all right and the thing here with this game of would you rather is you actually have to do the thing that you would rather so anna ava would you rather dance the robot like for us actually dance the robot or sing some lyrics from a recent song you played or heard or whatever oh i'll let you think about that and since since you know i'm putting you on the spot and it takes a maybe a teeny bit of prep um i'm gonna allow you to pick one for me okay no okay you can pick for me i you know either one i'm like kind of like 50 50. pick one for me ava what are you feeling like i want to hear pat sing too a hundred percent okay all right so anna and ava know that uh know the song that i've been listening to and it has something to do with uh uh a question i'm gonna ask our panelists later on but the a recent song that i've been listening to a lot is one of my favorite songs it's from the 90s by nelly it's a song called air force ones okay so i'm gonna wrap just the first few words okay kids and this is the clean version kids so this is this is from the 90s kids probably before you were born um give me two purse i need to burst so i can get to stomping in my air force one big boy stomping in my air force once all right see that's what happens when you play would you rather and you actually act it out now what's up with anna anna would you rather do the robot or lyrics from a recent song um i think i'm gonna have to embrace my dance moves uh and do the robot eva what are you feeling like is this going to be a coordinated dance or are you going to go solo i we should coordinate that dance because okay okay okay so uh we're we're doing this we're dancing the robot count of three ready one two three i robot does a robot yes there you go very good all right i robot doing the robot that's amazing um you know what else is amazing uh their jobs so uh let's start off with just uh having anna neva telling us about their work what do you do and how does your work help your community we'll start with ava sure um so what i do on a day to day is i'm mostly in a lot of meetings but i get to be in a lot of meetings with a lot of cool people uh where we all kind of sit together and collaborate and think of how we can solve some of uh the hard problems that the company's facing or what cool features can go on the robot um for example we had a meeting for our last robot where we discussed some of the features and um poop detection was one of them so i got to work with to be clear for kids poop detection yes poop detection so the robot will drive around your house and if your pet if your dog or your cat did a nono on the floor uh you know the robot will see it and it will drive around it instead of you know smearing it all over your house yeah that's important which nobody wants yeah that's important yeah sounds cool ava anna what do you do yeah well um i'm also in a lot of meetings with ava um outside of work and inside of work but at my job my job as a learning designer which i had never heard of before and i used to be a teacher and it feels like i'm still a teacher in this job so a lot of your students in the crowd right you have your teachers that are planning lessons and really fun activities to help you learn different things and that's what i get to do in my job i get to do it with one of our super cool educational robots called root so everybody this is root root is a super cool awesome robot that has lots of sensors and features like eva was talking about um we have light sensors in the eyes so it can detect if it's bright or if it's darker outside there's touch sensors here on the top of our robot so you can touch them and code root to move or turn or play music uh in the center here we have this there's a hole right there this is where we can put in a marker because our robot can draw so you can put a marker in there you can make root blow up on the lights here there's bump sensors in the front so as i'm driving my robot it bumps into something i can code it to move around maybe navigate an obstacle course and on the bottom of our robot there's also more sensors like our cliff sensor here this is great it'll detect an edge if i'm driving on my desktop i don't want my robot to fall off so it's going to stop when it sees an edge when there's nothing below it there's a color sensor here so it can see four different colors and i think the coolest part about a robot is that it's magnetic so i can go up on a whiteboard and drive around and draw whatever i wanted to play music or really whatever i want as long as i can do it with code wow yeah yeah so i get to design cool projects like coding pizza slices and having people eat this eat the pizza or playing lots of other fun games too so um you know i robot uh obviously is a company that creates robots and ava was talking about the roomba i believe right yeah um what else and and there's this uh robot how do you spell the name root root okay yeah um what what what like in a you know what's a brief summary of what irobot does like is it just about making those two robots is it just about making robots that work around the house like what does i wrote what is irobot all about yeah that's a great question pat um ava chime in but i robot so ava was talking about our roomba robot so we have a lot of robots that help out around your home so we have a vacuuming robot we have a mopping robot if you spill something so irobot is a company that's really dedicated to building robots that are going to help you in your life wherever you are at home or at school so we're not just about vacuuming and mopping we also care a lot about what you're learning in your classrooms and i know ava can talk a little bit about our stem outreach program and how we go into classrooms just like this but really help make those connections between what you're learning in school and your math classes to what we're doing at a big tech company like irobot and ava about that roomba and the poop detection how you know a class wants to know a fifth grade class wants to know how long did it take to program the robot to find the poop and do you have some pictures for us uh i don't know i think has a a slide with some pictures but that's a great question it took it took a long time but what's more impressive i would say like it took a year or so but what's more impressive is it took a lot of people working on it together with different skill sets um so i got to work with one of my really cool colleagues and she is a machine learning guru so her team was in charge of getting the pictures and figuring out what is poop what's not poop um what the robot can run over what it can't run over um and then my team was in charge of kind of helping her um process those images and upload them so they can see the the the images in order to make these decisions at in a fast enough time where the robot can react um so that's just an example but it took a lot a huge it was a huge effort it took a lot of people a lot of different skill sets to work together and even that it took a year to deliver this got it wow um and so that was a question that was asked us by southside elementary actually hi southside elementary um so if anyone else out there has questions please put them in the q a and we'll we'll definitely um ask our panelists those questions uh moving on though uh what's awesome about your job uh we'll start with anna what's awesome about your job anna my job is really cool and really fun um i get to work with an incredible group of people i have to shout out my team we have a really small team if any of you have worked on a group project before or worked in maybe a station or a center in your classroom this is kind of like what working on a team is like you're with all of these really cool people who happen to be your friends who are brilliant and come up with these amazing ideas that you say okay let's try it so one idea that our team came up with was building with lego maybe a lot of you like to build with these kind of bricks like this little dinosaur that my niece built me or we have a little space shuttle like this how many of you like to build with legos raise your hand guys yeah right let me see i like to build legos awesome so our team also likes to do that and we're all like big kids so we designed this piece that goes on top of our robot like this so now we can start building on top and start building things like mechanical arms and uh like dinosaurs and catapults and we get to have these really fun ways that we call we call them play testing in our office so we want to make sure that there's they're fun for everybody and not just fun for us so when we launch them to your classroom we've already tested them inside so our team is really awesome and super fun to work with and they inspire me every day so it's really cool to be able to think of an idea and then make that happen wow that's so interesting that someone could have a job where they're creating activities learning activities like school activities kids but they're super fun and engaging and then they get to spread those activities and that equipment all throughout the world that's so cool ava what about you what's what's awesome about your job uh i think the first part is i get to work with anna because anna's awesome and she's one of my best friends before she worked at a robot um the next thing that's like awesome about my job is i get to build robots and see all the different teams and all the different types of engineering and all the different thoughts that it takes to build these robots not only that i get to build robots that help clean your home so people have more time to do the things that they like to do like play video games or watch anime or you know those are things i enjoy so i think that's the best part about my job yeah ava when did you start working at irobot um i started as an engineer about three years ago in 2018 and i started this new role probably six months ago okay and that new role again is uh director of software engineering director of software engineering all right that's what a director of software engineering does and anna how long have you been working with irobot yeah i joined our team in 2019 so just over two years uh just my two year anniversary a few weeks ago and and you were teaching before that right yeah i was teaching and also working on a maker space which is how i met ava uh we were trying to design a cool stem robotics program and i had no idea where to start and then i coincidentally just met ava and she was like hey i'm looking for something cool to do i love working with kids and i'm brilliant and i have all these awesome skills and so she helped us build this really awesome robotics program okay cool you know we have some questions in the chat so i'm gonna actually take a couple more of these questions um what is your favorite thing to code to code what is your favorite thing to code and either of you can answer this question that's a great question for me it's it's um how i can get different devices to communicate with another device so i like coding um the software the program that will allow that communication so if i want the robot to say hey i'm stuck i like to be able to code so the robot can take that message and send it to your phone or send it to somewhere that you can see it yeah oh that's really uh yeah i i don't have a roomba yet um but uh that's an important feature right if it is stuck to let someone know to get it unstuck rather than just just staying there yeah anna what about you what's your favorite thing to code yeah can i share real quick i have a couple favorite projects um that i've loved to be able to to create and contribute to so one is uh we talked earlier about coding slices of pizza how many of you like pizza i love pizza yeah okay yes i know i love pizza but we could create this with code so one of my teammates coded the slice of pizza and then we have to code how to eat that slice of pizza right so you can do really fun things with code as well like also creating something for a friend like a card that you've coded and you can code it in a simulator and then take a screenshot of that print it out and give it to someone that you care about to express kind of how you're feeling right so code is used for selfexpression and being able to share those feelings with the people that you care about and then we also have this really cool game that one of our teammates designed and it was a group project but it's all about mini golf and so it teaches you how to code but in this gamified fun way so that you can learn to do these basics and then you can be able to do things like like ava and she's helping mentor people in her director role people who are learning how to code always i think that's the most important thing is that we're always learning and always trying to get better at what we do so we can help other people any any robots that you all are working on right now that you can talk about or any new robots planned at irobot there's always we're always working on something um there's not much i can share but as as a robotics company you can imagine we're always working on something um using our brains to figure out what other cool things we can introduce okay and and uh is it mainly around the home is that is that what where you guys kind of like uh do you mainly work on robots that work in the home or do you work on robots outside the home as well um so for the most part we mainly work on robots around the home um yeah cool um and we can share one of the educational robots actually just was announced um wednesday so two days ago so this is like hot information for everybody um it's one of our advanced robots so once you get really good at coding with our root robot then you can get more advanced with something called create three and it's gonna be out officially in april so we were just letting people know that they can start helping us test um so we're looking for people who have a lot of experience with robotics because it's one that will help you grow right um and so we just released that information but coming back to what ava was talking about in the beginning about how long it takes to build a robot this robot we're we're looking for people to give us information to let us know okay what works for you and what can we do better and then we do something called iterate uh maybe some of you know this when you're when you're writing an essay right or working on something in class uh like a paragraph or a sentence and you have to edit it and someone next to you maybe your your best friend is like hey i think you can do better i think you could say this in a different way and you scratch it out and correct it and and start to really make it the best work that you possibly can put out that's what we try to do with our robots all the time we're always trying to make them better for the people that are using them yeah iteration super important i think that's probably my favorite part of coding actually iterating and debugging um and making something more efficient um what have you um uh i know you all are very interesting people and uh one of the great things about having a job like yours is that it allows you to pursue certain passions right um so what do you do outside of work let's start with ava what do you do outside of work well a passion of mine is collecting sneakers [Laughter] out there wow we have the director of software engineering at irobot who's a sneaker head look at that all right ava showandtell whoa whoa that probably fits some of you all too it definitely does but this is like one of my favorite pairs it's the jordan one um i have a few pairs of the jordan ones but this color is my favorite just because it's so vibrant and out there and bam [Laughter] um my other favorite is the nike airs i always wanted these growing up my older brother had them um and i couldn't get them yet so as soon as now that i'm an adult still wearing kid sizes but an adult um i i had to buy them and i love the colors on them so this is my other favorite my third favorite is the jordan 5 um this was a collaboration this is my favorite because it was a collaboration with offwhite um so i like the the little zip tie here um then there's this little details here it was all about the details so yeah that's what i do i collect different types of sneakers um mostly jordans but i i'm just a sneaker head at heart there are some kids some some teachers are trying to uh calm some kids down right now because they're probably deciding they're looking at those shoes and thinking oh i want that i want that and kids yeah when you when i mean when you get a good job you're it's not just about the job as well as about the the life that you can um live um i know a lot of people um who like to travel a lot um and uh you know that getting a job in technology allows them to do pursue those types of passions and what about you what passions you have yeah um i love to make art so i love to make art with people with people i don't know with friends with family i'm always looking for opportunities to just put out some art supplies on the table and just invite folks to come over and and draw or or collage dabble whatever you need to do um i always carry some kind of art supply wherever i go in my purse so there's always opportunities to like sign something or to make a little doodle and i've done this my entire life i've always found myself creating these little little places or little spaces and and trying to get people to to share whatever they need to share as well so lots of art lots of dancing we've been salsa dancing a lot my partner and i in our kitchen um and then i have a really cute dog that i love um so we go on lots of walks together too well you know you you're mentioning some things like art and and just making things that i think you probably have been doing is that right all my life yeah you've been doing these things like art and making things all your life yeah i have do you want to uh you know so what what were you like when you were little anna yeah um i have a piece of art here um that my mom has saved um let's see so get ready everybody how old were you um so i was probably i don't know maybe i was in first grade or second grade obviously that is my best creation it is a rainbow unicorn for those of you who cannot obviously detect what i've created um and that's my signature it looks a little different now but um i always as an artist i was always encouraged make sure you sign your name on your work and be proud of what you've done um so this is this is i loved rainbows and i loved color i just loved expressing myself and finding different ways obviously you can see the second picture that is also me dressed up as i would in any kind of print or pattern that i found in my closet uh and also i wanted curly hair forever and ever so i would put rollers in my hair and oh my goodness i don't wild times so but i always found ways to just try to be me and be myself authentically whatever that looked like um and then i always loved trying new things so this is me eva i think you also love basketball uh and we've played basketball quite a few times but this is my first attempt at basketball once upon a time or soccer or gymnastics we're not really sure what was going on there but um yeah probably karate um but yeah i've just i've always been interested in in pushing myself and trying new things and you know just always trying to learn wherever i can um in any capacity so i was pretty pretty adventurous as a kid so ava what were you like as a kid um so i'll say this part in in spanish a little bit uh jonas republica dominicana um familiar when i was a child what i said there was i was born in the dominican republic and i and i came here to the us when i was about four and and i was raised in lawrence massachusetts which is mostly a city of immigrants so i was able to be raised around my culture and continue to participate in my culture which was a huge part of me growing up i grew up very family oriented always around family but as a child i was very sporty i played a lot of sports with my two older brothers so basketball baseball softball football um and i also practice karate and it has pictures in my chair so yeah i think as a child i i tapped into kind of the competitive side and the sport side which taught me a lot about teamwork uh collaboration competition working hard um and discipline and from my mom and my dad's side my dad's a painter and my mom's a writer so i also tried to paint and write to kind of follow in their footsteps um so i was just a ball of like i would say sportiness and creativity and also like a casual black belt like what these are fun things that you learn about your friends i'm sure all of you have learned different things that fun facts that surprise you about the people that you know so well but that was one thing that i didn't know about ava the other part on here is look at that last picture and how big that trophy is like that's huge so we were thinking do you think that trophy is bigger than baby eva or is ava bigger than the trophy what do you think what do you guys think huh all right well let's take a peek oh that's we get we have a picture oh look at that look at that so actually after doing some math here we're putting some hard math skills to the test everybody that trophy is actually smaller than ava but only by a few inches how wild so that's baby ava yeah so so kids look you get to um at i robot obviously people get to work with their friends and create exciting things uh eva uh and unfortunately we're at the end here and i just wanted to give you uh one last chance to share something with the kids that might motivate them to pursue a job like yours as a learning designer at a technology company or as a director of software engineering or just a software engineer in general like what what would you want to share with our students so that they might consider following in your footsteps sure i can go first um i want to share that coding enables you to build a lot of cool things it doesn't have to be robotics you can build websites you can build games it's kind of endless what you can do with coding but it is hard i i struggled in college it didn't come easy i um pat and i were joking before that i would cry sometimes when i would get homework i would get stuck um and i had people to help me along the way my brother misael helped me it's as long as you have a support system um you can get through it and your support system can be a teacher it can be anyone but just know that it is hard and you have to be resilient but just don't give up because it's hard um you'll be able to create a lot of awesome things and you all have something to contribute and great ideas i'm sure so um i can't wait to see what the future looks like when you're all coding drones and different robots and different things to do um so yeah that's that's kind of what i want to say yes 100 yes um i want to second all of that and then just add in when you're curious about something follow that that thought or whatever it is that's that's peaking your interest i would never have imagined myself here in this job i didn't know what i wanted to be and i always thought i have to have a plan i have to have a plan i have to be this or i have to be this and really you can be so many things there's not one path your path is going to take you on lots of different twists and turns and ups and downs just like ava's talking about sometimes you're going to cry and sometimes you're going to be so excited but as long as you're learning something along the way i think that you are again like eva said you're going to do great things and we are so we don't even know what you're all possible what's going to be happening in the next 5 10 15 years you're going to be creating those things so stay passionate and stay curious yes all right kids uh thank you again anna ava from irobot and that ends our class chat today uh please uh visit the cs journeys website for more resources and to sign up with for other class chats that we're having thank you bye everyone
