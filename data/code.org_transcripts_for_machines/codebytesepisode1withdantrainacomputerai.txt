hello out there thank you for joining us my name is dan and i am a curriculum development manager here at code.org and thank you so much for joining us for our afternoon session of code bytes i'll make a little camera adjustment so that you can see my wonderful um head accessory going on up here um thank you so much for joining us in this episode of code bytes we are going to be talking about artificial intelligence or ai and we're going to teach a computer to classify different images um and i'm super excited because you're coded or we believe that anyone can code and so i am excited to be joined by my father eric and together we're going to learn about artificial intelligence you want to come join me up on the stage round of applause round of applause for eric here hey folks there we go right here we have been this is very important we are now matching a little bit i have my code chart and he is of course the code guest and so we are very excited to be um facilitating this investigation into artificial intelligence um so first of all so welcome pops it's good to see you it's been a long time yes absolutely can you share how old you are with the world i i know i look young but um i'm really 72. 70 to accept generations and we're going to talk about ai have you have you done any work with ai before not knowingly not knowingly what are some ways you think ai is like impacting your life right now the news in what way well i get my daily news brief and i notice that it's geared specifically to me so like the recommendations yeah the recommendation it's saying things like we think you'll like this we think you'll like that you know what you're exactly right any of those recommendations things like on netflix or spotify we think you'll like this we think you'll like that that's ai okay um so thank you so much for joining us here um and we know that you out there in the world are joining us as well we'd love to know where you're from there's a couple of ways you can tell us there's this link that you can go to code.org map and you can tell us where you're from and i think we're going to switch over and take a look at all the folks who are joining us right now we have over 400 viewers tuning in a look at all these people from all over not just the us all over the world wait down in antarctica we have someone who do you know in antarctica santa claus that's very true so we probably have antarctica on the screen we have the us i see i'm we're in arizona i live in tucson so i wonder if there's some arizona folks oh and i see people in the chat sharing where they're from thank you so much oh this is wonderful well we are going to go ahead and get started and so this week we're celebrating the hour of code which is when millions of students like yourselves are learning the basics of computer science and this event has passed over 1 billion student engagements did you know that 1 billion people that's crazy right yeah pretty amazing pretty amazing reaching students in every city around the world and so we are going to do a couple of things today we're going to train an ai to recognize different fish to help it clean up the ocean we're going to train an ai from our webcam in order to recognize sign language which is going to be really cool and we're talking about some strategies involving bias and harm to avoid those when we're working with artificial intelligence some really deep stuff going on wait so are we teaching the people about sign or are we teaching the fish we're going to teach well that's a good question here i can tell you exactly who we're going to teach okay so we're going to teach our friend ai bot right here this is a i bought floating in the world and his job is to clean up the ocean but ai bot has a problem you see so we're going to start with ourselves first all right so like because we have intelligence we have natural intelligence and one of the ways we know that is [Laughter] okay do i not always have natural no no no no no thank you so much so other things we can do this thing as human beings we can close our eyes and when i say the word fish i want you to think of the first thing that pops into your head and those of you participating as well in the chat i want you to try that too close your eyes and when i say the word fish type in the chat what type of fish do you see ready three two one fish what kind of fish did you see when you closed your eyes and thought of a fish soda fish you know one of those tropical fish with the the appendages that go up and down and and uh they look superfluous but they're not uh i guess they have some function you know it's beautiful but small very colorful with like the extra little like appendages and things there's like those deep sea fish that are all the way down to the ocean coral reef the coral reef fish see that's that's a fish when we think of it yes i thought of like nemo from finding nemo i thought of the little clownfish design but important thing is that we have these mental models for what a fish is and our ai bot does not have the same model he has no idea what a fish is so one of the first things that we need to do is give it a machine learning model just like we have a mental model it needs a machine learning model to know what a fish is so what do you think about this is that a fish yeah i think so too that's a fish what about this one uh yeah yeah what about this is that fish well as far as i know no i agree with you that is not a fish so we're going to say that this is not a fish now what about this no i think so too i'm going to kind of click through some others fish and not fish and what we're doing is we're giving ai bot these mental images we're letting it figure out what are the things that are fish versus not fish and it might start to notice some patterns it'll notice patterns with like how the the image is shaped it'll notice patterns with the colors it'll notice patterns with the features fish have eyes and mouth and trash does not and when we've done this for a while we can have aibot test out and see how it does based on this machine learning model that it's done you ready to see how it does yeah so this so what should it do with this this light bulb should keep it get rid of it get rid of it should get rid of it let's find out okay what right away it made a mistake well this is good though it's getting rid of that that's a fish that's a nope clearly we made some mistakes in here somewhere ai bot does not have a very clear mental model of what or rather a machine learning model of what a fish is versus not a fish we can even investigate a little bit and take a look at the things that ai bot has learned so ai bot thinks all of these things are fish and over here it thinks all of these things are not fish and so what's happened is aibot has noticed patterns it's noticed some commonalities it's maybe tried to figure out with its mental model what a fish is for example like most of these fish look round right yeah so i think that's why i thought the light bulb was the fish because light bubbles around my boat so how do you think we can fix this with ai bot how can we make sure that it doesn't make those same mistakes we need more fish examples we need more fish examples but isn't like there's more than just fish in the sea right yeah there's like seahorses and starfish even if we trained it to recognize all the fish wouldn't it still get rid of those other ocean creatures too i think that'd be like a problem i don't know so okay so with my ai experience i know but i'm sure that if you put enough information in it'll be able to discern the difference i agree with that enough and varied information it can figure it out that's like the key principle of ai look at you you can go apply for ai jobs now you can go work at like amazon or google or microsoft look at that so we have just trained this little ai bot in order to tell the difference between fish and not fish and it's built its own little machine learning model and this process where we gave it some data we let it train on itself and then we tested it to see how it does that's the really common process that happens with ai all the time if you wanted to play around and keep going with this little tutorial you can find all that information here at code.org oceans which is pretty cool but we're going to switch gears a little bit and we're going to go to a different program we're going to go to a program called teachable machine and the thing that teachable machine does which is really cool is instead of training images just on the fish on there we can have it train on our webcam up here okay so in order to do that if you decided to do this at home and you wanted to play around i would recommend just googling teachable machine which is a nice thing to do because google makes this program so then you'll find it really easy google will point you right there and so one thing that we can do is we can use our webcam to train things now i need to do something special that you won't have to do at home i need to turn off my video here so that i can turn on the webcam here and then you can see me on this website there we go we're right there see we're back yes we're back okay so we're gonna do now we're gonna do something that was inspired by an experience i had when i was still teaching and so when i was still teaching at the high school classroom we had a student enroll a couple of years ago and she was a deaf student and when she enrolled a lot of the students in our community started to realize there were some accessibility problems in our in terms of this person participating in high school and engaging in high school and being able to get the education they deserved and we started to realize that there's a lot of things about our environment that wasn't very inclusive to the deaf and hard of hearing community and so what the students did is they made a petition and they rallied the administration and they said hey instead of french and spanish and these other world languages you should offer american sign language too and they listened and they found a teacher and they started a program and now that school has a thriving american sign language program did you know that this is a true story no i didn't i know it's pretty cool right yeah so i was inspired by these students and i was really motivated to try and continue to build an inclusive community for the deaf and hard of hearing and i wanted to make something with ai that could recognize sign language because then i could help communicate with folks in the deaf and hard of hearing community so we're going to do we're going to use american sign language which is these features here and so you can use your hand to form different letters of the alphabet and we're going to spell the three letters e v and a so again we're gonna do e v and a do you know why we're gonna do eva it's my favorite word one of my favorite words why is it one of your favorite words uh your daughter i have a daughter named ava isn't that so cute we're going to teach you if there are any avas out there in the world this is for you same name as my daughter same name as lots of folks out here at code.org we're very excited so if i want to use this website to do that first i need to say i'm going to train this on the letter e oops and then down here i need to let it know i'm going to train on the letter v and then i need to add one more section to let it know i need to train on the letter a oops i misspelled something that's okay we all make mistakes cool eva so the way this works is we have to hold up our hands to represent the letter e so e was like this all right so i'm going to do it first you ready i'm going to use the same let's go ahead okay so i'm going to press and hold record i'm going to move this around a little bit and what's happening is this machine is learning i've given it 99 images all representing the letter e now i need to do the same thing with the letter v and so when this loads up okay are you ready yeah that's my big moment this is your big moment big moment folks all right so you're going to hold up the v you ready v there you go okay now there you go you kind of move it all over the place no not sideways that's your voguing now v for voguing okay there you go that's a good one right there okay great so we're moving in all those different places so it can learn that it's the v that's important and not all the other stuff that's going on now we're going to go down here to a and i'll do the a again so as i go to do this here is a and i have my a right over here and i've given it about a hundred images so i made sure that i've given it the same amount of training images i got 99 i got 120 i got 99 right here and now that i've trained it on all these images i can press this button and this is when it starts to do the work of training the machine of learning the differences between the e and the v in the a and so as it's going through and doing this i got to stay in this tab and it's going to click through and do these pieces i'm going to try and share my video again oh look at us over here on the side um in preparation for this i reached out to my old high school and i asked the american sign language club there to share some facts about the um deaf and hard of hearing community in asl i want to share some of them with you can i do that right ahead so did you know that 90 of deaf babies are born to hearing parents no i didn't know that either until they told me i was going to share some more i have a couple more that i'll share in a little bit but right now i want to go back to this and i want to test out this model that got trained so here we are right there okay so you see us here in the middle and then down here we have these predictions of what it's trying to do okay so i'm going to hold up this was e i'm going to do an e right here it's getting a little confused a little confused it keeps thinking that it's an a oh there we go so down here at the bottom it has these little percentages of what it's trying to predict why don't you try your v why don't you hold the v very strongly thinks it's a v you did a much better job of training than i did that probably because you moved it all around the place because i'm older it's because you just have more experience more wisens hopefully hopefully i think so too and then if i do the a out here there we go pretty strongly down here knows that it's an a down here i'm not sure what happened with the v i'm a little sad that the v didn't show maybe i'm like holding it the wrong way oh no well the e oh wait hold on come back into the picture a little bit because you were like oh see that makes a difference because it's learned that you're in the picture when i do the e and the v and the a i have a lot of troubles with some people um even though this is kind of a silly example where i can't tell the difference between an e and a v and an a sometimes artificial intelligence is used in things like facial recognition where telling the difference between one person or another it's not as silly as just these asl letters it can mean the difference for someone it can be very impactful for the people when it doesn't work as expected so we always want to be careful when we're doing things with artificial intelligence and things like image recognition to make sure we get the most accurate models possible when you follow along at home there's a couple of extra cool steps that you can do to make sure that you can share this out if you decide to make an app that uses eva or you decide to train on other asl symbols once you've done that you can go into this menu and click upload my model and when you do that it'll take a second but then you'll get this link here and when you get this link here one thing that you can do is you can copy and paste it into a new window and you'll get this other website that you can send to your friends and your family and you can use out in the world that has your same trained model in it down here so then if i wanted to there's your v why don't i try a it was over here a is working i don't know what happened with e oh wait e's a little bit i didn't maybe it's because like you know what it is i blame these guys that must be what it is ai isn't always perfect another cool thing that you can do with this same model as well is you can use a website called p5js and if you've done things with web design or web editing this is a way that you can import your model into this other website we can click on that top one there and if i press this play button right here it loads a website that i can also share with people that will also use our machine learning model you see how down here it says daytime yeah it's not what i want because it's using someone else's machine learning model so instead i'm going to go in here and i'm going to copy this line of code that has my model with it and i'm going to paste it right here instead and i'm gonna paste oh i lost paste where's paste i'll just use my keyboard for it instead and then i'm gonna stop and refresh the page and now if we did it correctly see letter v letter v then i'm gonna hold up the a letter a so if you were to do other sort of hour of code tutorials involving websites or things like that you can then build more out of this as well so cool we made an artificial intelligence machine learning model brave for ava um at this point actually i think what i'm going to do now is i'm going to jump ahead to this website i'm going to stop sharing my screen so that you all can see me on the big window here oops i didn't mean to do that i'm going to have to go back to the screen that i was at before there we go um one of the things that we're about to do now is we were going to have ava join us um but ava is asleep so you don't get to meet my baby i know so that's very sad we weren't going to wake her up just for code bites um but we were going to have her come and join us as well but in the meantime we have honored ava's memory and made her letters here if you wanted to look up other american sign language symbols and make your own app around it you can totally do that that just about wraps up our code byte episode so hopefully now you know a little bit more about artificial intelligence and the machine learning process where we gather data we train a model we test it out and if we had more time i would go back and retrain it because oh boy that e still isn't going very well do you learn some things about artificial intelligence i think so yeah what's like what's like your takeaway you're like your five word summary my five word summary sure oh gosh um um you're less than 10 words and that's in some word summary but you wanted a quick answer i don't know if i have a quick answer i'll come back to you okay um i want to share with you if you would like to learn more about artificial intelligence we've got this really awesome panel coming up that you can participate in tomorrow as well i've got a website for you that you can check out it's code.org slash ai and we have this ethics of ai panel that's happening tomorrow that you can participate in and so when you go to that website code.org ai you can see this ai for oceans you can learn more about that and help train the fish you can learn more about what's happening behind the scenes with this how ai works and we've got this awesome exploring the ethics of ai panel that happens tomorrow at 10 30 pacific and i think it's 1 30 eastern those are about those times which is pretty cool all right do you have your do you have your do you have your thoughts around artificial intelligence [Laughter] no i want to say that i'm suffering from a 72 year old sense of memory and uh you'd have to repeat the question again well hopefully advances in artificial intelligence can help with things like memory like those are some of the things that they're doing yeah definitely definitely i would need that you need like a little ai um you need a little ai assistant or something right right right well i am going to close out of these things really enjoyed my time with you all thank you all for coming go make some artificial intelligence machine learning apps go use them to improve the world around us and be careful with the data that you use thank you all so much what happened to the people who raised their hands
