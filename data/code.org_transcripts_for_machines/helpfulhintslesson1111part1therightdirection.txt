congratulations for wanting to solve the challenge puzzle it's really difficult but that's okay it's supposed to be hard and the first thing you want to do when you face any difficult problem is to understand what you're trying to do in this puzzle you might think you want to creep forward and check this first cloud and then continue on but the real trick here is understanding that sometimes it's quicker to come back to something so for this puzzle think about moving all the way to the end of the path and addressing this cloud before turning and doing this path turning and doing this path and then turning and doing the final path i think that will set you in the right direction happy coding
