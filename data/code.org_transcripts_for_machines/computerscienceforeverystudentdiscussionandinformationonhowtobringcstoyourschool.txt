good morning and afternoon to all that have joined us today to discuss why computer science is for every school every classroom and every student i am jackie smalls the chief programs officer for code.org and will be serving as your moderator for today's presentation we want your participation today so we're going to take a quick poll we want to know who is in the audience are you an administrator teacher student parent or joining us in another role to learn more about computer science while you take a minute to answer the poll please note we will be moderating the q a encourage you to ask questions throughout the presentation give everyone a few seconds to take see what our results are well great we have 44 that are teachers we have 20 percent about 20 that are administrators we have some parents we have some students we have others that have joined us so thank you so much i'd like to get started by first introducing our former secretary of education arne duncan secretary duncan was u.s was the u.s secretary of education from january 2009 through december 2015. as part of the obama administration beforehand duncan served as chief executive officer of chicago public schools from 2000 and i don't have that i'm so sorry but until 2008 duncan won praise for uniting the city's stakeholders behind an education agenda that included opening 100 new schools expanding after school summer learning early childhood and college access programs dramatically boosting the caliber of teachers and building publicprivate partnerships around a variety of education initiatives he currently leaves leeds chicago cred a nonprofit trying to achieve a transformative reduction in gun violence in chicago he also manages the partner he's a managing partner at emerson collective an organization dedicated to removing barriers so people can live to their full potential secretary duncan graduated magnum laude from harvard university in 1987 majoring in sociology welcome secretary duncan thank you so much for being here i would also like to introduce our ceo and founder hadi partovi hadi partovi is a tech entrepreneur and investor and ceo of the education profit code.org born in tehran hadi grew up during the iran iraq war where he taught himself to code at home after immigrating to the united states he spent his summers working as a software engineer to help pay his way through college upon graduating from harvard university with a master's in computer science heidi pursued a career in tech starting at microsoft where he rose to executive ranks he has founded multiple startups and served as an advisor to wellknown tech companies but his main focus is code.org code.org has established computer science classes reaching 30 percent of u.s students created the most broadly used curriculum platform for k12 computer science and launched the global hour of code movement that has reached hundreds of millions of students spanning every country in the world heidi's family lives in seattle washington and isn't spare in his spare time which we all don't think he has much of but in his spare time he enjoys skiing water sports playing music and playing word games thank you for joining us hottie thank you so much it's it's an honor to have you with us secretary duncan uh where are you visiting us from right now i i assume you're at home after the pandemic uh where are you situated yeah plea please call me already you know better than that and now yeah home in chicago and lived two blocks from where i grew up so it's good to be back home on the south side oh great well i'm in seattle uh i'm excited uh to hopefully get to the near end of the the shutdowns from this pandemic i got my second shot just about a week ago so i'm i feel like a free man and i hope you've gotten vaccinated too as well i don't know if you have the chance yet but yeah no we have our family's uh been vaccinated so we're real lucky we were sick in november and hit our family pretty hard and we're we've lost like many folks we've lost you know friends to to the to to the pandemic to cobia so we are very very lucky and grateful to be on the other side of this and just want to see the country get to the other side of this as quickly as we can yeah i'm extremely hopeful that we're at the beginning of the end um would you like to share a few comments about you know just how the pandemic has impacted education and for all the teachers and administrators in the audience thoughts on basically the reopening of schools and what we can expect to see coming up soon well that's not a small topic i'll try and be brief first i just um so you know to educators to parents to students really just want to say how profoundly sorry i am and i'm always very honest for better or worse i've said repeatedly that i think this pandemic morphed from a natural disaster to a manmade catastrophe and other nations because they listened to science because they took it seriously recovered much more rapidly much more quickly than we did and the loss of life here has been absolutely staggering for our educators the loss of learning time loss of a chance to be in physical schools uh for parents the stress of trying to do homeschooling for a year for students you know i've you know we have a high school son and a daughter a freshman in college like so many you know millions of families across the country just to have our our children lose that chance just to be kids and to uh and to be proximate to each other and to have some fun and to play and just have normal social human human interactions just desperately sorry i also want to say how unbelievably inspired i am by how hard educators and parents and students worked throughout this there was no playbook nobody prepped for this at any time in their their life we haven't had anything like this obviously in this century and so to see people roll up their sleeves and work so hard on every aspect of this yes academically but students social emotional needs i i participated in a weekly call starting last march so far from you know basically over a year to make sure food was being distributed through through uh through schools and just herculean heroic efforts they are our schools aren't just place of learning their social safety nets and to see just not just students but families in the community being fed um during a desperately difficult time again beyond inspiring and i think the challenge for us all all now highlighted outside of people is that for me the goal is not to go back to quote unquote normal because normal didn't serve tens of millions of kids well enough and so how do we you know reimagine how do we rethink education in many many different ways we can get into a few of those ways now but it really is a chance to to create a system that is more equitable and fair and just and gives every child a chance to fulfill their extraordinary academic and social potential so a difficult time but also a time of hope for me of creativity and the final thing i'll say that if nothing else i think our children have learned how interconnected we are how important science is how if our family is okay but if our neighbors family isn't uh then none of us are okay and for for the many things i think we as adults haven't done well uh my hope is that our young people for the next 30 40 50 years will lead our country in a very bet in a different way and honestly a better way and uh won't take our democracy for for granted ever and won't take our public health or education for granted ever and um if they can take the very difficult lessons of the pandemic forward um the next couple decades could actually be a pretty remarkable time in the united states yeah among the things that i think about the bright spots is just how much technology has helped people cope you know 100 years ago during the you know the the last major pandemic people didn't have zoom they didn't have the internet any of the things we take for granted uh you know i have kids who are uh 14 12 and and seven and my sevenyearold he was in first grade has now become an expert zoom student uh but not only he's learned how to use zoom he's also learned how to schedule his life because you know instead of being in one classroom he has to click two different links and things like that and he's like on top of his own schedule which my other kids didn't learn that when they were in first grade so this is forced them to learn new skills and really our teachers and administrators all around the country and even all around the world have embraced technology in a way that schools haven't before you know for the last 10 20 years people have been talking about what are ways technology can help education uh and everybody basically had a rapid rapid like all right we have to figure it all out right now um you know whether it's video conferencing or scheduling or live q a or quizzes or things like that just all the different ways teachers have figured out creatively how to engage their students and you know one of the beauties of american education is there's no sort of central plan for these things teachers everywhere came up with their own solutions creatively and that's it's wonderful to to see the different ways they've done that for the work of code.org one of the things that's critical now as we think about the reopening is how to frame that you know we're entering a new world and in that new world computer science is much more important than it's ever been uh and you know aside from all the things we need to teach students at you know the work of code.org is around teaching computer science just like we teach math just like we teach english or regular science or history or foreign languages you know we're in the 21st century now and all the problems our communities are the human race is going to need to solve are going to be technical problems or problems that we can solve with technology and it's important for our schools as they've adapted all these new technical skills during the pandemic to figure out all right how do we move beyond just teaching with technology but teaching about technology teaching about the way these things are built about how to create them and so on uh and that's one of the things that i think uh it's a real opportunity for america uh but it's also an opportunity we need to deliberately act on it's not just going to happen naturally if we go back to the old normal the old normal most schools don't teach computer science because it's sort of this special subject that you don't think is for every student and that's one of the things i'm hopeful that this country can sort of add into the curriculum as we as we reopen you know i just appreciate your leadership and tenacity so much what code.org has done is uh pretty spectacular and it's it's um it's almost like everything in our society we think about the pandemic we think about issues of racial justice or racial injustice lack thereof and technology as you have lived as you know better than anyone is an absolute game changer if our students are are confident and fluent and company you know can solve problems um they're going to have a world of opportunity ahead of them and if they don't then they're going to really struggle we know a wildly disproportionate number of the jobs of the future are going to involve you know technical literacy and it's a thing where it can either this is really up to us it can either be the great equalizer or it can exacerbate the divide between the halves and the have nots so there's nothing for me inherently feel good or bad about it the world is going that in that way and i think we have not just a an educational um but a moral uh necessity uh to make sure all of our children have access to these skills and access these opportunities to learn and as you probably found the hard way too often in education we move a little bit at a glacierlike speed you know we don't adapt quickly and as you said the pandemic for better or worse is forced us to think differently and to to teach differently and the idea that children can only learn something in a physical building you know six or seven hours a day you know nine you know nine months out of the year five five five days a week that doesn't make any sense anymore our children have to be able to learn anything they want anytime anywhere any place 24 7. having access to technology and wifi and internet devices is so critically important but if we think reading is important and we know it is if we think mathematics is important we know it is um computer science is the new literacy it's the new currency and i just want all of our children to have access to that and let me clear to have access to it at an early age not uh you know high school is great but that's a little late in the game if we start much much earlier than that when when we know students can uh children can absorb uh so so much and so i just appreciate the extraordinary progress that you and cordaro have have had on how much you have spurred change from the outside i think it's incumbent of upon also you know in the education world um to really embrace this uh now and make this the norm not the exception for kids and to do it again with a real equity lens that i want to make sure children here in chicago in the inner city and children um in appalachia and children on native american reservations um all have access all have access and have access to the great content and great curriculum and great teachers and great technology and if we do that i would say talent is much more evenly spread than opportunity our goal is to have opportunity to meet that talent whatever it is and it's everywhere and that's that's the job ahead of us that's the job ahead of us yep the sad thing is only about a half half of us schools teach computer science and half of them don't and if you look at the ones that do teach it it's the schools that are wealthier the schools that have less diversity among their student populations schools that are mostly in the suburbs rather than the cities are rural and those are the problems that we're trying to to tackle as well jackie's going to come back and she has some folks who are going to ask us questions as we continue the conversation so we're going to have i think three people joining us thanks so much hoddy yes we have some special guests representing the voice of students teachers and administrators so i'll start with some introductions first i'll start with miles mac miles is a graduating senior honor who's an honor student as well at patrick taylor science and technology academy in louisiana he has grown up loving stem and plans to major in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science he has participated in summer stem programs at mit and us irvine working on artificial intelligence machine learning and programming projects miles is very busy and he's ready to take on the world so we welcome miles we also welcome athena talk athena is navajo from two grey hills new mexico which is one which is on the navajo reservation she is currently teaching ap computer science principles at bond wilson technical center and finally we have mr milo mc mcminn a second generation new mexican educator who works at central consolidated school district which serves over 6 000 students on and off the navajo nation milo is the founding principal of bonn wilson technical center and early college high school cte academy that offers school high school students industrybased learning in mechatronics computer science and engineering prenursing culinary arts welding construction and industrial maintenance welcome miles athena and milo and i believe miles has the first question he'd like to ask hello everybody um i'm really into computer science but many of my friends aren't sure if they want to pursue a career in it so um my question is secretary duncan and heidi um what would you say to students who are on the fence about pursuing a career in computer science how do you start off follow your lead miles thanks for your leadership uh sure well you know if you have friends who are thinking they don't want to they're not sure about a career in computer science the question is any career you want to go into whether it's marketing or design these are all increasingly technical fields if one of your friends wants to become a doctor or a nurse everything about healthcare is being changed by computer science even if you want to become a farmer the future of farming is selfdriving tractors you know and farmers increasingly need to actually code their tractors or debug their tractors most people don't realize is how much even something is as traditional or considered the old school is farming has become a technical field and then also computer science helps develop the mind so you know why are we teaching math it's not because you want to pursue a career in math but every student learns math because it helps develop your thinking skills and the same thing is true of computer science just as much yeah just a couple quick thoughts that for me the goal is not to tell everybody this is what they have to do for their career we all have different interests and passions what i want to make sure is that your friends aren't locked out of these possibilities and again i'm going to keep coming back to the lack of equity across our country in everything you know health care criminal justice and yes education is real and so i just want to make sure that your friends have a chance to decide whether or not this is what they want to devote their life to and at the end of the day you know what's the nature of work going forward the nature of work we don't know the jobs you know what job are you gonna hold probably exists yet you know i'm not smart enough to know what that's gonna look like what i do know is the nature of work is gonna be around solving problems that our ability to solve problems to work together um to work in diverse teams to work not just domestically but internationally that's going to be best to define who's successful and who's not and if you have those skills i consider you know computer science to be integral to be critical to that you have those skills you're going to be able to do really well for yourself for your family for your community if you don't have those skills you're going to be on the outside looking in and that's pretty scary and so for me it's never about telling anyone what they have to do or what they must do it's exposure let them know what those careers look like what what does those salaries look like it's hard to imagine doing something you've never seen before and so you know that's what i think what hotties you know devote his life to and other folks is to making sure that a hundred percent of our students not just the privilege not just the wealthy not just the affluent not just the white but all of our students have a chance to make this decision for themselves great i think i'm next thank you for having me here uh my question is i'm lucky enough to be in a school that offers computer science but many schools in my region and area both on and off the navajo nation don't have that opportunity how can principals really promote computer science in their schools both at the district level state level and the national level so this is a you know this is a great question if if a school doesn't teach computer science or if your school teaches some computer science but wants to teach more i think almost every school in the country has an opportunity to expand its offerings lots of schools teach sort of an introductory class but don't teach ap level computer science uh and whether you have cs or not the top questions schools ask are first of all what is the budget for teaching it but then most importantly who is going to teach it because if your school doesn't have a computer science teacher you know you look around which one of us is going to teach this class schools don't have a budget to hire a new teacher and the work that code.org does more than anything else is professional development of existing teachers so that your history teacher your math teacher your science teacher even your art teacher can go through a professional learning program and actually become a computer science teacher using the code.org program and this is something you know that's available in every single state and in in most regions it's completely free of charge to the school especially high need schools we offer scholarships for teachers to go through the professional learning program so they can basically effectively on code.org's dime or rather thanks to the generous donors that have supported our work we will train the the the teachers in your school the hard thing for an administrator like yourself is also making sure to put room for it in the schedule you know so for example at a high school level you need to open up a slot in the master schedule you know for for at least one computer science class and if you open up that slots i guarantee you students will sign up for it or if your school teaches introductory cs if you open up an ap class ap computer science has become the fastest growing field in the history of the college board ap program it's because students actually really want this stuff and and most administrators don't realize the students demand for this because students know that this is the future and if you say we're adding this course they sign up in much larger numbers than people expect but the first step is getting a teacher to go through the training program uh and you know code.org training program the professional learning program is is i think one of the best ways to start especially because for almost for most schools we make it free thanks to the scholarships we provide yeah did i hear your it showed that your school is an early college school is that correct yeah we are partnering with navajo technical university we had a meeting here yesterday and they said hi to you arnie so i wanted to share that welcome with you as well yeah first of all i'm just a huge fan of early college programs you know high school diploma is critical but i think it's almost not quite enough important but not sufficient i'd love to see every child graduating every student graduating with some college credits in their back pocket um or industry certification or both and the college exposure and you know just appreciate you so appreciate so much you're working on navajo in navajo nation and all of our children deserve a worldclass education but no one no one deserves it more than our native children communities and the chance to take a college class is not just for the high flyers it can be for students who are thinking about dropping out or thinking just college isn't for them that they don't they don't know anyone they've never had a family member go to college and to have that experience and start to think well i can belong on a campus and i can succeed with collegelevel work again just it's not just the academic learning sort of the mindset the mind shift and uh really opening up the the world of possibilities so one just a huge fan um thanks for working the community that deserves the best in terms of how do we expand this to other schools um for better or worse you know today in this day and age you sort of say who do people listen to they listen to their peers so i love hottie hotties and amazing salesmen but honestly most principals might listen to you before they listen to him or listen to me and not they don't already have a fulltime job but the more you're talking to your peers that's who people trust these days the more you're talking to your colleagues letting them know um the training is important and it's really interesting how he says about sort of opening up a slot and so this to me is just a really critical point i don't want to blow through it you know computer science can be in some places like a quoteunquote extracurricular but i don't think it's an extracurricular it's essential it's got to be in in the in the core and that again has to become the norm so figuring that out i know there's some you know technical issues and scheduling issues but where that doesn't happen when it gets pushed to the side or somehow pushed out then our students don't don't have access and then i think and not again everyone might not agree with this but if we can't get a teacher at every school tomorrow which we know is going to take some time could we have a teacher at one school teach students at three or four or five high schools or 10 high schools frankly or 20 and that's again that's a bit of a controversial idea but i don't want to wait and more importantly i don't want our students to wait a year or two or five years until those teachers get trained and let's just provide that access now you know obviously using technology virtually we're better at that than we've ever been and uh where we have expertise um whether it's on a native american reservation or not on a reservation um let's make sure our students have access sooner than later and just encourage folks to think to think a little differently and think a little creatively there great thank you my next question is kind of a mix of those i i really believe that computer science is essential and then it should be part of core instruction you know same with math science history and and social studies but one thing i hear from from colleagues is how can we integrate uh computer science when we're dealing with standardized testing and kids still need to learn the basics and we need to focus on that what would you tell administrators who say that yeah so this is a it's a very very legitimate question a hard one and i just think we have to it's a it's a tough one to sort of you know talk through but we have to stop pitting this thing against it against something else and it's got to be we have all these debates in education and 99 of the time for me it's not either or it's both and so we need math and computer science we need language arts and we need foreign languages i would add we need financial literacy and if we're serious about giving our children a chance to build positive futures for themselves is not one is more important than the other i would argue that many of these skills reinforce each other if you're more interested if computer science sparks your interest that might help you do a little bit better in english potentially or in algebra and it gives you a reason to be excited about going to school each day and that's going to be a different you know a different subject or a different you know our class for every child but adding this into the mix many many you know our students a lot more fluent often with technology than we are as adults we're meeting them where they are and i promise you is it's you know if we want to see more young people be successful if we want to continue to reduce high school dropout rates which are still too high if we want more young people not just to graduate from high school but going to some learning um beyond college and start to build positive lives for themselves there's never one answer we have to do 20 things well but one of those things one of those strategies has to be access to this extraordinary word world of technology and computer science in all the world of opportunities that are available to our students if they're successful there for the rest of their lives one of the questions i get a lot and actually many of the panelists or many of the attendees have asked is whether computer science should be required for graduation uh you know because you're asking how do schools deal with this when they're struggling to teach the basics i firmly believe computer science is one of the basics you know if you were to start a school from scratch today and there was no education system there wasn't 200 years of curriculum from the past and you're just deciding what should students in the 21st century learn to prepare them for life how many years of what subject there's no way you'd say zero computer science whereas that's what most schools in this country teach because they're basically teaching what they taught last year and the year before and a hundred years before but this but it takes a mental change to think this is one of the basics and and there's many states where they're actually already making that mental change arkansas just passed a law saying computer science is going to be a requirement for high school graduation in south carolina and in nevada in both of those states it's also required for every study students to study as part of their k12 experience and i'm pretty sure that if you think 10 years out this is going to be mandatory at least at some level for students just as basic preparation but it's going to take us time to get there i think athena and miles have two more questions because we all we also want to get to the segment where we say how do you do this and how do you ensure that computer science is in your school so we're going to make sure that athena is able to answer her question and miles will end with yours okay hi everyone so my question is you know thinking you know integrating computer science with everything how do we get students engaged you know students that might not necessarily think that computer science is for them you know sometimes we get students placed in computer science that don't know anything about it and they don't they immediately want to change classes because they don't think they can do it i i'd love to answer this one you know as adults it's often you know adults mostly are intimidated by technology uh it's sort of like oh this scary new thing they want to use an app but they don't want to you know learning about the insides of stuff is not something we all learned when we were growing up so as adults people think computer science is like calculus it's like rocket science it's like for the more advanced kids for the kids they're so at home with the technology and the best way to engage them is with the creativity instead of saying we're going to learn computer science it's asking them what would you like to create what game would you like to create what app would you like to create what website would you like to create and that makes it a lot more like art class or like music class where it's more playing and creating and at every age even among adults creating is what drives people you know once you decide you want to make an app or make a game then you're the learning is really just about a means to an end rather than you know this thing that you have to learn because school told you that you need to do it i also would say you know when i when i first studied computer science when i was a kid it was very math oriented so it's like we were writing the code to calculate the fibonacci sequence of numbers whereas in today's day and age computer science is about changing the world and the next generation is going to need to tackle so many world problems whether it's you know things like climate change cleaning the oceans global poverty gender equality curing diseases and every one of these problems we're going to need to solve using technology so telling students that the reason to learn this class isn't just for the creativity but it's to be part of that next generation of problem solvers i think is very very motivating for our youngest learners amen thank you miles we have time for your question and then we'll conclude this segment okay so my last question has to do with diversity so we know that computer science is dominated by predominantly white and asian men so um i guess my question to you guys is how do you think we should go about integrating computer science with women um black latinx and other people of color in the field yeah i mean that's the right you know maybe most important question to to start and end with and for me this is not a selfcorrecting problem and if we don't intentionally try and close that access i don't talk about achievement gaps i talk about opportunity gaps if we don't close that opportunity gap you're going to see that divide grow it's going to get worse and worse and so this to be has to it's all exposure exposure exposure it's committing to those young people in those communities early it's not waiting to high school so what are we doing with our third and fourth and fifth graders to have these conversations mentorships uh job shadowing again physically virtually whatever just being exposed to this world i i'll just say what i said before talent is everywhere opportunity is not and if we just sit back and take who comes our way we're going to continue to be you know white male you know dominated and that's not what the world looks like now that's not bringing out the the genius that exists everywhere across our country and so we have to very intentionally go to under represented underserved disadvantaged marginalized whatever you want to call those schools those communities we all know where they are we know who they are we have to go and intentionally create opportunity when it doesn't exist and i promise you if we do that that talent will more than meet us halfway but that's on us that's not on the kids that's on us as adults to make that effort and hold ourselves accountable for doing that this problem is very near and dear to my heart having basically spent my career in the tech industry it's an industry that is uh basically dominated by white and asian men and addressing that isn't just something we could do in k through 12 as those basically diversity issues and inclusivity issues in k12 in university and in the corporate workforce but as k12 educators which are the audience here primarily are teachers and administrators we have a major role to play access is for sure a big part of it it's depressing that a student who is black is almost half as likely to have computer science offered in their school than a student who's white that makes no sense at all in the united states of america that's also why for the schools that don't teach computer science where especially for schools with highly diverse populations code.org makes scholarships available for the teachers to learn how to teach it and any administrator on this on this video call that if you're in a school that doesn't teach computer science please have your teachers sign up for a professional learning program but access is the first step actually getting enrollment is important encouraging students that you don't expect administrators actually changing their mindset to stop thinking you know as administrators people often or teachers put their stereotypes out there in the world because we live in a world of stereotypes and if you imagine who's a computer science student if you don't imagine a student like miles mackey you might not you know give that opportunity to everybody and teachers can do their own effort to draw students into this class and besides enrollment once the student is in the class the feeling of inclusion in that class is also important as well if you feel like you're the one kid who's different if you're the only girl in a classroom full of boys where you know the teacher needs to spend effort to make sure every student knows you belong in this field and that's so important that sense of belonging is is lacking for a lot of students who don't see themselves as future computer scientists but i firmly believe this is a problem that we can change and k through 12 education can change if you look at the numbers the number of young women and the number of black or latino students in computer science have grown 10 times 10fold increase in the last eight years through the work of not only code.org but many other organizations like ours we're not we're no we're near balanced representation but we can see that this 10x growth is happening because of the work of educators and that's one of the most inspiring stu stories in in america today with all the problems in our country the work that teachers are doing to bring diversity into computer science education has been a huge success jack do you think we're out of time with secretary duncan yes we are so i want to thank you um secretary duncan hottie miles athena and milo for the conversation and thoughtful insight my takeaway from listening to you all is there's a call to action to do our part i think we heard that let's do our part and provide an opportunity for students to learn computer science administrators please consider how computer science be part of your school and teachers learn more about our professional learning program which you'll hear in a few minutes but i want to thank you all again for spending time with us and having this conversation thank you so much i invite everyone to visit code.org your school where you can learn more about our professional learning program but we're going to talk about that in our next segment so i'm excited to tag team with my colleague alana aaron alana is an educator who spent 13 years as a teacher and district administrator at the new york city department of education where she was most recently worked where she most recently worked on the district's computer science for all initiative alana is the director of our outreach team i'll turn it over to you alana thanks so much for the intro jackie i'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share a bit about our professional learning program with everyone here today what jackie didn't tell you is that i am a living testimonial that new to cs teachers can teach code.org courses i picked up the curriculum and taught it to my fifth grade students in new york city without ever having taken a computer science course myself so if i can do it you can do it that's to the teachers on the call and now at code.org i have the opportunity to help schools and districts nationally bring computer science to their students so let me begin with the code.org vision our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to take a high quality computer science class we believe that by reaching underrepresented racial and ethnic groups like cody and arne were just talking about and young women we can both increase equity and opportunity and help take one important step toward increasing diversity in cs so miles thanks for setting us up nicely with your question one strategy we employ to help us achieve our mission is providing free open source curriculum as well as professional learning opportunities for teachers to date more than a hundred thousand teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms have gone through the code.org professional learning program to prepare to teach computer science so what do we offer our k12 pathway includes cs fundamentals for elementary school teachers we offer two workshops for elementary teachers an introductory workshop for new to cs teachers and a deep dive workshop for teachers who have started implementing the cs fundamentals curriculum in their classrooms for middle and early high school teachers we offer cs discoveries an introductory computer science course that empowers students in grades 6 through 10 to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity communication problem solving and of course fun for high school teachers we offer cs principals a higher level introductory course that introduces foundational concepts of computer science while challenging students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world this course can be taught as an advanced placement or ap course or as a nonap course and i'm excited to share that we are currently developing a computer science a course which is recommended for any high school student who wishes to continue their computer science education after completing an introductory course like cs discoveries or cs principles we will launch this course in 2022 the code.org csa course builds upon structures introduced in csp are in cs principles excuse me and we believe this course will be accessible to students who have traditionally been underrepresented in computer science like csp csa can be offered as an ap course or as a nonap course check out this growth from code.org and everyone else working to support computer science education i love the direction these graphs are going but we still have a ways to go we are still only up to 25 female and 20 underrepresented groups taking an ap cs exam this is where our regional partner network comes in we've partnered with just under 60 organizations nationally including nonprofits universities and government agencies who offer our professional learning programs locally to teachers in their regions there are many advantages to this model including local staff and facilitators in each region for professional development who can support new to cs teachers locally throughout the school year and provide resources for new districts and schools interested in adopting a computer science program a common barrier for schools and districts wanting to adopt computer science is funding of course in most regions scholarships are available for teachers who meet the scholarship criteria but we want to tell you about another opportunity sr funding since march of 2020 the federal government has provided state and local education agencies with 195 billion dollars in emergency relief funds to help address kobit 19's impact on elementary and secondary schools this funding comes from the recently signed 1.9 trillion dollar american rescue plan and two previous covid19 relief bills enacted in march and december of 2020. these funds can be used to support computer science locally in various ways and we hope your school or district will take advantage um i believe eric is going to put some links for you to access in the chat so that you can look into this and without further ado i'd like to introduce three of our amazing regional partner program managers to talk about the work they're doing locally in their respective regions first i'd like to introduce cheryl bobo cheryl's an educator with 35 years of teaching and leadership roles in alaska and is currently working with the alaska staff development network to expand computer science in alaska's urban and rural schools by creating professional learning opportunities for teachers and admin she enjoys the unique opportunities that come with working with students educators and admin across the vast state of alaska next we have larry nguyen who is the cs program manager for the my stem network and grand valley state university and supports cs implementation across the state of michigan welcome larry and last but not least we have paige prescott paige is with the cs alliance where she works to expand cs education in new mexico through a multipronged approach that includes teacher professional learning and policy at the district and state level welcome paige so i'm going to kick off our panel with a question for all three of you um paige let's start with you what makes a strong computer science program and what can one do to make computer science sustainable in their school district and or state hi everyone and thank you um it's a great question that i think about often and one of the things is i try and think about where is it most fragile and one of those is maybe that the teacher hasn't yet gotten trained in the school or the district and so providing that professional learning and making sure that that teacher once they do get some training feels supported and so then where else do they need support and maybe we want to think about the district level or the principal level and you know in the case of in the prior segment with athena as a computer science teacher and her administrator milo she has support and so she is um she knows that she has a network that she can tap into other computer science teachers through code.org and then also her principal is supporting her so does milo as a principal need some support is that a fragile area and so i try and think about it in an ecosystem level you know that all levels have some connection and feel supported and the other thing is that i try and keep computer science um thinking it very positive like make it fun make it inclusive and to keep that together more carrots and less sticks um when it comes to computer science and the last thing that i try and do is whenever i talk to anybody in a community especially anyone connected to computers uh to education i ask the question what are you doing to support computer science so that could be a school board member it could be an educator it could be a principal um it could be just maybe a volunteer in the community that is connected to the school or with the parents what are they doing to support and just by using that term like computer science education it alerts them that oh they should be doing something so then it gives the opportunity for them to either ask me more questions or to ask questions of the the constituents that i'm trying to get them to interact with which is mainly the schools um and then also make sure that students know about opportunities as well and to ask that as well like how are you getting involved in computer science oh well maybe i should and then they can feel um a part of that community that we're building and my metaphor uh is really right now deepening the bench because um one of the things that i want is i want teachers to have colleagues uh that they can connect or connect with and that you know it takes away that fragility where it's not dependent on one single person and their passion but that there's maybe if that teacher uh moves into a different position that there's another person in that building that can take on teaching computer science or maybe that there's other principles that understand the systemic ways that they can support computer science in their district and so that's what we want to do is just make it as pervasive as possible as inclusive and as possible and as positive as possible thank you thanks so much paige larry do you have anything to add on that yeah it's actually uh thank you for having me it's a perfect segue to to my thought with this building a strong cs program um it's easy to have one teacher be a shining star within a district and invest in that teacher and you have an awesome program but what happens when that teacher decides to retire or happens to take on another position and who's going to take up that mantle and so if you really want a strong cs program in your district you have to invest in it as a school district in a community and say we are going to be a part of this it's going to be part of our school improvement plan we're going to be doing we're going to be thinking about this is all our planning processes we're going to be thinking about multiple instructors doing this work and so that way it's not linchpin on one instructor and that it's the entire district has a plan to move this forward and not just that one person and so that's that to me is that the huge piece trying to strengthen it within the district thanks larry and cheryl um anything to add from alaska yeah i i want to say yes and all of the above they did a great job in kind of prototyping what what we're all thinking about one of the things that i wanted to add that's really important especially in a vast place like alaska is the unique relationships and i believe that building the relationships with the department of ed the university superintendents principals teachers counselors and community i try my very best to educate the community also to the value of what this will bring to their community but um developing giants reaching out to individual um districts or schools and talking about their strategic plan and and how i read their strategic plan and how this absolutely fills so many of their little points and um awareness dispelling misconceptions is really important uh video production is not computer science per se it's more in liter digital literacy and lastly i want to say that culturally for like many of the small communities it's providing careers and job opportunities in their own local communities good paying jobs where they can stay in their communities and help care for their elders without leaving and having to go to california or anchorage to take you know get jobs they can stay home and take care of their elders so um it's it's multipronged but it's it's got to be relationships and it's got to be individualized thanks cheryl speaking of relationships i think we'd be remiss to not acknowledge the impact of covid19 on our schools and as a result on the work we're doing to achieve our shared mission um so what impacts has coveid19 had on the professional learning program in your region cheryl i'll send this one back to you yeah i'm glad to answer this it's a great question and after the panic you know settled down a little bit and the chaos brings opportunity and we had a lot of chaos in alaska trying to figure out kids didn't have internet there was a lot of things going on but we were able to in our csf program increase it to 48 of 54 schools have participated in training now and it's because equity has rose to the top and we're offering it all virtual anyone in alaska no matter where you sit if you're sitting in your car if you're sitting in your school or the school lounge or wherever you're able to connect with professional development now so i think that um it has increased equity across the state of alaska way more than tenfold that's i'll just keep it that short but we have been able to reach a lot more and we always wanted to go virtual because of our big state so um you know there's some good things that do come out of bad things thanks cheryl larry would you like to add yeah so i can the way i would approach this is the pandemic has benefited at least the professional learning aspect has benefited our rural areas um i can speak to our upper peninsula in michigan it's it's six to eight hours to go from one end to the other and to ask teachers to meet and for professional learning is very difficult it's taxing and so by providing this virtually now we are able to to reach those areas of our state that geographically was difficult to reach and it also suits the folks that they got families at home they can't travel long distance they can't spend that time and so overall just having both virtual and facetoface now uh just supports the equity for our teachers thanks i see some some trends across your states page would you like to talk about the effects in new mexico well one of the things is um that it really lit a fire under the equity and access of broadband so we just ended a legislative session and there's a lot of investment that will be made in that need that became just it was always there but now it became through this past year just so obvious how important access to internet was and so hopefully we can see some changes that are going to happen in new mexico but also um across the country that will allow our rural students um and our urban students to have uh access to great highspeed internet going forward for their education thanks so much um we are getting close to time but i have one last question for the three of you um i wish we had more time but in our final minutes what are two words of advice you'd give our audience and what can the folks here do as soon as tomorrow or next week to start growing a cs program in their school or district or region um try to keep it to like 15 to 30 seconds each please let's start with you paige so one of the questions i i mentioned it earlier ask the question what are you doing to computer uh to support computer science education or to be involved in computer science education so just by asking that question you get that conversation and that engagement and my two words are community and depth so building a community of educators and people connected to computer science education and then giving the depth of that experience thanks thanks so much how about you cheryl two words of advice um two words of advice i i my big words are flexibility and listening be flexible and meet them where they are not what you plan to give them but what they need and listening carefully to your community to your parents to the teachers um you can help them with their challenges thank you and larry to close us out yeah so my two words are directed to school districts and that's invest in culture and so if if you really want to have that strong cs program within your school you have to invest within your teachers within your planning process within your school improvement process you have to build a culture around cs if you wanted to survive within your district larry cheryl and paige thank you so much for joining us and for all the work you and your organizations are doing for the students of alaska michigan and new mexico we really appreciate your partnership um and here we are despite the amazing work our partners are doing on the ground and all the progress we're seeing the truth of the matter is that most schools still don't teach computer science so please join the movement if you're a teacher visit code.org your school like jackie shared earlier to apply now and after this webinar please tell a teacher friend to apply as well parents contact your child's schools to advocate for a computer science program and if you're an administrator connect with your local regional partner you can reach them through this link that will be in the chat as well bitly backslash contact my rp to connect with your local partner to find out what offerings are available in your region and with that we want to say thank you so much for joining us today we hope you can get started with something you learned here today in your region tomorrow so thanks so much for being here with us and one other note you'll receive a survey link so please make sure to participate in the survey we want to hear your feedback and we thank everyone for joining us today we know you will join the movement to ensure all schools all classrooms and all students have access to computer science thank you so much have a good rest of the day everyone
