so good morning everyone i'm thrilled to be here at this very special event and be here among students and educators administrators tech leaders celebrating something that just does not get enough attention that should get a lot more attention which is computer science education um so let me tell you my own story which in some ways is actually similar to peggy's story about how i developed my own passion for computer science so as a kid i was always doing creative projects drawing painting candle making mosaic making paper making you know all those favorite all those little art kits they sell in the store for kids i probably you know always wanted to do every single one of them the thing is i had never connected that computer science was actually a creative way of making services products that had the impact to change the world so what happened to me was i didn't pursue it i actually have a degree in history and literature and my senior year in college i by accident interned at a startup i actually worked for this temporary service i used to come home from college and say just send me wherever you want sometimes they send me to lawyers office doctor's offices everywhere and one time by accident i was sent to a startup and after i was there for a few days i realized wow there's something interesting here and i was answering the phone at this place and i thought you know i actually would like to do more than answer the phone i think i could do the same type of work as the people here in the office how do i do that i'm going to take a computer science class now i was a senior in college writing my thesis studying history and literature and i thought surely it is too late for me because i'm 20 and i'm a senior and my life has already been decided um and i just can't change but i had a friend and she was taking a computer science class and i always think back to that about how influential everyone can be whether they're a student if you're an eighth grader you can influence a sixth grader so my friend was taking a computer science class and i thought you know if she's taking it i can probably take it so here i was i signed up for computer science my senior year as a history and literature major and took it and that's how i discovered my passion for computer science it was it was amazing to me that this one class really changed my life and i'm always grateful and think wow my life could have been very different if i hadn't had that one experience in that one class now i was very lucky to take this class but in today's world where technology is changing every single thing we do it shouldn't be about a matter of luck um computer science actually does a lot in data as we talked about and computer science is something that should be available to all students students also shouldn't have to wait until college i'm amazed the way a twoyearold can pick up a phone and figure out how to use it our kids today are digital natives they should have the access to learning computer science today in their school but many kids do not have that opportunity google commissioned a study and it showed that only 40 percent of kids in k12 schools in the u.s offer computer science class and have access to them and as low as that number is the good news is it's an improvement because two years ago the number was only 10 so it shows that we can make progress when we focus on it and i do think code.org definitely had something to do with raising the number from 10 to 40 but we still have 60 the majority of kids still are not getting computer science and that's why there's so much important work left to do now it also has an impact on diversity the ap exam for computer science has the worst racial diversity of any ap course only 22 percent of students who take the course are students of color and black students in particular are less likely to have access to computer science classes compared to white and hispanic students so unless we make computer science something that is available to everybody we risk making these racial disparities worse now on the other hand if we provide it to everyone we also have an opportunity to benefit everyone and if you look at the economy you look at the importance that technology and tech jobs play in our society there are nearly half a million open computing jobs in the u.s in every state in every industry and they are projected to grow at twice the rate so we have a chance to enable all kids no matter where their background is where they come from which family they grew up with their only child or 15 one of 15 to give them the opportunity to have these experiences google has been working to provide funding to nonprofits to expand coding in schools we have our made for code initiative to inspire girls to take coding and as part of cs week we're encouraging students to also try the hour of code and we're doing a project to build a holiday emoji so if you're looking for a good project to do with your kid this is one and you can create your own google logo with the special coding activity and we also have a google doodle that encourages people to solve a puzzle using simple block block coding so i'm very happy to be here kicking off this week i can't emphasize enough how important this area is for every kid out there in the future and for our community our society our country and the opportunity to enable all those great kids out there in the world to really be the next leaders in technology and to make a difference for our world so thank you for being here i'm excited to kick off all the projects that we're going to be doing together thank you
