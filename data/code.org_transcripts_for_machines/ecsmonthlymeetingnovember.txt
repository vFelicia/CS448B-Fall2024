great uh to have you both it's great to have you join us tonight um we are going to uh have our november meeting this evening where we're going to have uh myself brooke osborne danny mcavoy and melissa jones take you through some updates um and things you should be aware of and also spend some time uh looking at tools for unit three so to reiterate our goals for tonight are to connect as a community to discuss how the school year is going to talk about tools for unit 3 and then at the end to just talk about any questions or concerns you might have right now um as a reminder i don't know if anyone on the call right now needs this reminder because you're getting the hang of it but uh you can use the chat pod on the right hand side at any time to just communicate with all of us we'll be monitoring it as we go and you can feel free to turn your mic turn your mic on and ask any questions with that if you feel comfortable so i'm going to turn things over to danny who is going to talk to us a little bit about some reminders and things to let you know about for this month all right thanks brooke so we have a bunch of reminders for this month uh as you guys know the unit one sri assessment came out last month and the unit two one is out this month it was released two days ago and will be up on the cs 10k site so you should take a look for that the site has been down for maintenance today but should be up shortly so keep your eye open for that especially if you're headed into unit two the unit three one is scheduled to release in december so keep your eyes open for that as well if you're moving to unit three um we released our phase three online for unit three and unit four today uh they look very similar to you what you saw in unit two we have tried to condense them a little bit um still give you all that great information but make it so you don't have to click through quite as many levels to get it all uh and hopefully that will be a positive change for you guys um hopefully the challenges have been going well i've been seeing a lot of posts on the forum uh with people submitting their challenge work and it's been really great it's also been great to see people pairing up and working together and giving each other feedback that's been really awesome so keep that up hopefully we can do that for unit 3 and unit 4 as well and then as always um make sure that you're sharing your resources in the resource folder and keep posting to the forum those um posts really help other teachers and it helps keep us at code.org in the loop in terms of what types of things you guys need so brook on to the next slide so we're just going to take a minute to check in and how's it going um i know that we get a lot of this feedback in the form but i wanted to give space here for it as well so if we can go to the next slide um we had a couple people tell us where they were in the unit so far right at the beginning of our chat tonight um luanne said she was in unit one which is great um there's no wrong place to be at this point you're really looking to go at the pace that your students need to make sure that they feel comfortable especially in units one and two you want to spend the time necessary to make sure your students get comfortable with the ways that the classroom runs in ecs and then the problem solving strategies because those will pay off big time when you get to units three and four so take that time now if you need it and keep working through the units you're at um let's go to the next slide so i just wanted to open up the floor these are a couple of the resources that we have um created at code.org or linked to so uh i would love to hear how things are going using these different resources if you have any feedback uh we especially i'd love to hear if anybody's used the sri assessment in their classroom because we heard from eric snow last month and um he came and introduced that assessment so if anybody's worked with that um either if you're watching after the fact you could post um that feedback to the forum as well i would love to hear it but does anybody in the call tonight have any feedback they want to share on any of these pieces online pd sri assessments the resource folder or the forum you can type in the chat pod or you can um just turn your mic on and talk up to you this is nicole and i would have to say i really like the resource folder it gives me a lot of great ideas on what other people are doing to modify the lessons to fit their students needs so thanks for everyone sharing in the resource folder awesome nicole thanks for sharing anybody else have any feedback they want to share on the forum the resource folder sri assessments or online pd okay well so if you're watching this recording after the fact make sure to share your thoughts as well to keep a part of the conversation we understand that people can't always make the calls at the time that we set them up but you can always um share your thoughts with us after the fact when you watch the recording so brooke if we could head on to the next piece all right so we're going to move on to a live demo of jsfiddle and this is an html and css editor and i can also do javascript but we're not going to worry about that um as you move towards unit 3 you'll notice that html and css are the programming languages we'll be using to start students off they help us do web design and in the curriculum there isn't a recommended way to go about teaching this right they they tell you how what concepts to teach but there isn't a editor that's suggested so we at code.org picked our favorite and we're just going to share a little bit about why it's our favorite and you can choose to use it but if you have a favorite go for it and use that one um we're not trying to make you use this it's just a matter of a suggestion all right so next slide brooke um so just for your information jsfiddle as i said is an html css editor and one of the coolest things about it is it allows you to collaborate so brooke and i are going to demo tonight how that happens and you'll be able to watch that as i share my screen but if you wanted to take a look and poke around in jsfiddle you can go to that site as well while we're doing this if you just google jsfiddle you will find it all right i'm pulling up my demo i'm going to share my screen um all right can everyone see my screen yep it's there alrighty so um i just made a simple little web page here and we're gonna we're gonna walk through kind of how to make this um and a couple of different features so instead of me trying to type this and get it perfect while we're on the call i'm going to copy over some stuff so first of all um you'll notice here i have a window that's blocking my view there we go there's an html spot this box that i'm going to paste something in that's the html spot you can see it pops up there in the corner there's also a css block here and then the results window is down in the right hand corner as i said this does also do javascript if you went that far with your kids this could be where you would have them type that as well so we're just going to test this out and see what it looks like i if you don't understand what this code says yet because you're still new to html and you're still learning it i would suggest going through the online pd nicole was one of the people that helped us write that and it's really awesome online pd um to help you get a grasp of html and css and then the unit 401 introduces you to scratch so if you're new to either of those take a look at them but we're going to run this and we're going to see it looks a little different than what i had before so i'm going to just make the window bigger for a sec so i can drag these and look at my results bigger looks like my image is really big right now and i don't have the pretty coloring that i had on the other page all right so we've just added the content and you'll notice that as you learn html that that is the content piece and then css is the style piece so let's add that styling that i had so i'm going to copy over my styling here um paste it in and now i have to hit run again to see the results so i'm going to hit run and there we go now i've added styling and don't worry about how all of that happened go through the online pd and get a sense of how to use these different pieces it'll be really helpful another thing we suggest um there are different websites that teach this so uh one of my favorites is khan academy if you're new to html and css take a step through khan academy and you'll feel much more secure and how to teach this stuff uh for yourself so i've created a simple little web page here it's just showing the results here and what if i want to make sure i have a name for it so if i'm trying to submit it and i want to name it i come into the jsfiddle options and i say danny's webpage and i can add a description i made this for an ecs demo so as your students are getting ready to submit things they can name them they can put a description there so they could put a note to you in that description probably um so that's nice that'll save and we'll just head back here um up the top here if i want to save this you'll notice that i'm logged in your students can make accounts really quickly and they'll have an account to save it so i'm going to hit save when i hit save i get a couple more options update update just does save on something that's already saved i can fork something so i can make a copy of it that i can then edit but i'll still have the old copy i also have tidy up so as your students are learning html and css they may not have the best practices in terms of keeping their code neat and tidy but one of the things that jsfiddle does for you is it'll clean it up and make it look a little bit nicer so if you saw as i hit that some of the stuff moved around and just spaced out a little bit nicer and makes it easier to read this j s hint button up the top will help you out if something in your program is not running well um take a look at that we're going to look at collaboration mode in a sec but i just want to show you share so up the top here under share i can grab a share link i can share a full screen result so let's take a look what that looks like so i'm going to copy this and open it in a new window and now i can actually test out and see my um web page in a full window that's what it would look like and show up like in a full window so students can test that out and not just in this little tiny window you can also embed these so if you want to show off what your students are doing in your own web page you can embed their web pages inside um so that's pretty cool and so now i just want to show you the collaboration mode this is one of the reasons that i absolutely love jsfiddle um so brooke's going to help me out with this i'm going to click collaboration hopefully it will pop up yep so you'll see that over here on the right hand side of my screen it popped up and said i can invite a friend so i'm gonna share this link with brooke we have over our chat that we have and so i just i just sent her the link and so she's gonna join me and you'll see friendly fox has now joined the session so um brooke join me and she can now actually type and add things to my project so if you watch my screen you'll see that brooke is typing and she just added a paragraph and she can then run it and we can see that she's added something so i didn't do anything i didn't add or touch the code but she can add things and we can work together um we can actually chat so we i could type messages to her so brooke do you want to type a message to me so we can see how that works so you see that brook can type messages to me there's also an audio feature which is newer um and it's still i think in beta mode but it's worth having your students try if they want to talk to each other as well i'm not going to do that right now because i don't think it will work very well while we're on a video call up and there brooke changed her name so now she is actually brooke so that's a pretty cool feature um as anyone's ever wanted to have their students work together on a project but they had to go home at the end of the night one of them had the project on their computer and they couldn't work together and they're trying to talk over the phone and they can't see each other's screen this is a really helpful tool to make that happen so it's one of my favorite features and i'm glad we got to share it with you so let's head back oh one last thing if i click on my name up here i can go up to my dashboard and you'll see that like everything that i've created is listed here so if you're wondering how do students save their stuff they can um they go to their dashboard and that's where it gets saved so if you're looking for that that's where it is all right so let me head back to uh chat and stop sharing and i that's the jsfiddle intro i would be happy to answer any questions that may have come up while i was sharing that does anybody have any thing they want to talk about or ask about jsfiddle brook there melissa do you have something um all right so there's also an intro to jsfiddle in the online pd so if you are looking for that take um a look through that and that will step you through a couple pieces of how jsfiddle works there as well yeah um i got booted out of the room quickly but there was a question in the chat pod about well a statement more about how new teachers might want to take some time to play with jsfiddle before introducing it to students do you have any tips for people who are completely new to programming or to web design i mean sure so my suggestion is to just find um you can so the ecs curriculum links to ww3 schools and we have some links to that in our pd um that's one way to learn about different pieces and probably the best thing to do is just to copy some code from w3schools into jsfiddle and run it and see what happens and maybe delete some lines and see what happens um i really love uh khan academy um there's other things that work just like khan academy but khan academy will has video demos that walk you through different topics in html and css so those are really great if you're new as well and you can try programming the different little tasks they have you do in jsfiddle if you want um so that you get comfortable with that platform along the way so those are always good ways to do it but the biggest thing with computer science is to just be okay with the fact that you may not always know every little detail right even when i teach a programming language i've known for a couple years or multiple years right i don't always know everything about that language and my students often find something i didn't know and teach me something along the way so be prepared to learn something and not always know everything computer science is such a fast changing subject you can't know it all because tomorrow it changes and is completely different so um that's a big piece of it so just accept where you're at and learn along with your students if that's going to be the best thing for you this year it won't be a big deal your students will still learn the html and css i have faith any other questions julie tells us in the chat pod that she's actually introducing html to younger students in fifth grade i'm wondering if you have any tips for introducing this outside of the high school classroom yeah sure um fifth grade that's awesome that we got fourth and fifth graders that might be learning it um i worked with middle schoolers and had them do html and css and i really think that it's something that's approachable at a lot of different ages and that's why it's one of the intros for uh ecs it's the starting place because it has such a low bar entry point and it's so creative so students at a lot of different ages can learn it um i know that pencil code has created something that has a little bit of more of a block base for html and css so if you're teaching at any younger age that might be something worth considering um but that lots of students especially if they have some intro to programming at some level we'll pick it up and enjoy html i think it's a great intro at multiple ages that's great i think that my students that i taught in high school had a bit a lot of reading challenges and learning differences so i think having that option of doing black black based even for older students is a great idea yeah all right there any other questions tonight ah so it looks like luanne has a question about where the online pd is so um the link should have been sent out to you for online pd from our ops team our operations team um and we'll actually at the end of these slides uh there's a link to a forum post where i post links to different things um updates and information so i'll put the links to uh online pd there for you if you need them luain and we had someone put them in the chat pod too so if anyone needs them later they'll be up there sorry danny i just i wanted to add to that once the as a as a teacher in our program once the the pde has been assigned to you it will show up on your teacher dashboard every time you log in so uh when you log into codestudio just at studio.co.org along with whatever classes you're teaching right now you'll also see whatever pd has been assigned to you so you shouldn't have to remember the url it should just be there for you when you log in awesome thank you all right so let's close out so can you go to the next slide one after that all right so we've been doing these monthly webinars for you the past couple months but um we found out recently that ecs is holding uh ecs specific webinars on the cs 10k community there's actually one next tuesday um and that schedule can be found on the cs10 community.org and what we're going to do is actually try and merge with them so that you can get content and ask questions from the curriculum writers themselves so you'll get to interact with them and other ecs teachers outside of the code.org community we're going to work towards that as our main point of webinars but we'll still be sharing different resources with you and we'll post videos to the forum if there's something we need to update you about uh as always we'll send emails and give you um updates that way as well so hopefully those uh the cs10k ecs webinars will be helpful to you and you can ask those questions that you see coming up in your classroom anything else so as i mentioned before um you can see here and i'm sorry that it's a long link we should bitly make it easier but on the forum you can find this under the general resources for the ecs um it's the ecs monthly meeting for november forum post and we'll put any resources or links that you might need from this call there it um i think we need to update it with the js fiddle link and um the ecs online pd links based on what people were asking about we have anything else melissa that you've noticed in the chatbot nope i don't think so i think we're in good shape um so thanks everyone for joining us and we'll see you next month all right bye guys thank you thanks everyone
