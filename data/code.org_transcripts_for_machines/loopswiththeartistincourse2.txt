Here we are going to use the repeat block to help us save steps when we are programming our artist. We already have some blocks out on our stage but they are just there to get us started. To loop those blocks four times to draw the whole square, we just drag out the repeat block and put the moveforward and turn right blocks inside the repeat block. When we hit run, the artist will repeat those steps four times to complete the square.
