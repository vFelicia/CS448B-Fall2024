hello everyone uh welcome to our hour of code live for africa code week we have a great session for you today and to get started i want to introduce my cohost adi is a team manager at sap ireland and works on africa code week passionate about ed tech creativity and innovation adi is the cofounder is the founder of code arena an ngo working to promote and strengthen coding and stem skills acquisition among african students and teachers he is involved in several stem coding initiatives such as eu code week coder dojo and first lego league and he holds a master's degree in computer science welcome audi thank you so much caroline for having me great are you very nice to be here today that's great it looks like this is going to be an exciting session yes very excited about our guests we have today um so let's get started we have two great guests nancy sumari and stella uzojubu here uh we're going to take some time to chat with each of them and demo dance party and ai for oceans but before we uh introduce them let's share why we're here today the hour of code in africa code week initiatives for those that haven't tried an hour of code before the hour of code started as a one hour introduction to computer science to show that anyone can learn it is now a worldwide effort to celebrate cs starting with one hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts we have tutorials in over 45 languages and this grassroots campaign is supported by over 400 partners and 200 000 educators worldwide we like to say that you can do an hour of code anytime whether it's during computer science education week africa code week or any other time of the year so adi and i have been working together the past couple of years on these initiatives and with that i'd like to pass it over to adi to talk about foot week thank you so much for online so for those of you who don't know what africa code week is africa public is the biggest digital literacy initiative on the continent of africa it focuses on sdg4 which is providing quality education to the youth in africa and we also focus on sdg 17 we support that because we believe in partnerships it will take the collaborative wheel of all of us playing in the sector in the private sector the thought sector and the public sector to do the right you know to make education uh to bring quality education to the youth of africa so we're working on the program in partnership with the likes of unesco irish aid idea and so many other uh you know code dog and so many other fantastic organizations so it's a program that builds capacity for teachers and young learners across africa we teach them coding and it's not because we think every child will become a coda when they grow up it's not because we believe that every child will become a doctor or uh or walk in the stem one of the stem careers it's because we believe that the skill set and competencies that they gain learning how to code will stay with them for the rest of their lives lifelong learning skills so uh the program started in 2015 and uh we scaled to 54 countries in 2015 we only started in south africa and morocco and a few other countries and in 2000 uh 2000 last year we scaled to 54 countries meaning uh the pandemic provided us with challenges as well as opportunity to scale this to a wider audience because now we could take this virtual so to date we've been able to empower over 9 million youth across africa and we've been able to empower over 50 000 teachers just think about it in the sense of the multiplier effect of training 50 000 teachers how many kids will pass through those teachers for as long as they continue to work as teachers so this is our sustainable sustainability plan to make this very sustainable for uh for the learners across africa and what's interesting is that 47 of the beneficiaries of africa code week are girls and female teachers because we also focus on gender inclusion so uh some of the comp we have different components of africa code week we have the african code challenge which is the biggest coding competition on the continent of africa which we run once in a year it's an opportunity for us for the beneficiaries of the program to show us learning outcomes what have you been able to realize what have you been able to learn and master in the past 56 years that we've been running the program so uh african code challenge is out there for every child every young learner to participate in across africa we also have the women empowerment program as the name suggests it's a program for women teachers to build leadership skills classroom facilitation skills even entrepreneurship skills and all those skills that would they could cascade to students or young people that they teach that would help shape their life and prepare them for the future of work so the final one is last year we created an app because we realized that movable penetration in africa is huge and we wanted to tap into the opportunity for young learners to be able to access our resources on any device on demand anywhere at any time online offline so we have a lot of um unplugged activities in fact we have some of the some of our uh code uh resources on the app as well so for those of you who don't know already that there's an app out there for you to download and learn how to code you can search on the app store the google play store to you to download it so to follow the journey of africa code week follow us on our twitter page africa code week at africa and uh our website is www.africa.org and uh we're on instagram we're live on on the social year on social media thank you so much i hope i haven't talked too much no that was great always love to hear about africa cooking thanks adi uh now i'd like to introduce our first guest nancy sumari nancy is sumari is a published author businesswoman and awardwinning social entrepreneur from tanzania nancy is the founder of the jenga hub the jenga hub is a maker space and learning lab whose vision is to reimagine learning to build a community of children and youth leveraging technology to create value and transform lives the hub's main purpose is to empower children to learn through crafting more wholesome learning experiences through technology and applying design thinking the hub's goal is to see children thrive creatively to become better learners and thinkers she is contributing to breed a new generation of responsible committed and digitally empowered citizens welcome nancy thanks so much for joining us today thank you so much for having me caroline happy to be here so great uh audi i believe you have some questions for nancy yes i do have some questions for nancy i'm nice that's very nice seeing you here today uh so i have a couple of questions um and you know it's just to get a sense of what you're doing and how you're doing what you're doing and the impact that you're making so my first question is how did you begin to get involved with computer science um well that's a very good question so when the genga hub was established we wanted to really think about how we mitigate the challenges that are in education systems across africa today teacherstudent ratios are very much numbers that uh really to be honest are one of the biggest challenges lack of resources infrastructure problems and we quickly realized that one of the ways that we wanted to or one of the tools that was going to be very sustainable was technology and ways in which we might be able to empower the children and the teachers and various stakeholders in education to make sure that we're mitigating some if not all of these challenges that that are being faced today and so we quickly started to establish school clubs uh where we would train teachers and empower them with digital literacy skills and then through them um they empower they further empower the children within the primary school settings and then we've slowly grown that footprint into secondary schools as well and working very closely with community centers across tanzania to see ways in which we might also be able to use technology and digital literacy as uh the tool that will will ensure and empower children um and ensure access to the right content and educational materials that will allow them to participate fully in the development agenda that's very interesting so something very interesting you mentioned there is the poverty of infrastructure so that became even more evident last year because of the pandemic so the past couple of years have been particularly very difficult for education more so even made more complex uh last year as i said how has your work changed with a pandemic and how are you bridging so two questions in one how are you bridging uh that are you solving that problem of poverty of infrastructure uh i think it had one of the things that continued to be highlighted among the challenges was the issue of access and it's access outside of the normal school setting that we are used to and so i like what you said about mobile mobile phone penetration and that's how we essentially pivoted we were we quickly very assembled the teachers that we had trained across the years and then wanted to make sure that we're depositing resources um and curriculums in these feature phones offline and offline available on demand and so on and so worked very very closely with different community members including parents who really rose up to the challenge to ensure that no child was left behind so i think even though it highlighted the issues around access but it also reiterated the importance of empowering stakeholders various stakeholders within the education system so when we're talking about children and empowering them with technology how are we also ensuring that people who are facilitating learning are also empowered enough such that in the cases of pandemics or any other challenges that might force us to rethink education we're really rising up to that challenge with various stakeholders so i'm very glad that our parents and our teachers really were very instrumental in making sure that in any case and in in various forms various children accessing uh materials uh to ensure continued learning thank you so much uh so my next question is why why do you think it's very important for young learners young african learners to embrace or learn computer science well first of all i think because africa is such a young continent the bulk of our population is young people we should be able to empower them with skills of the future we have a lot of challenges in our continent but also there is a lot of opportunity right and i think technology gives us that power and that mandate to be able to solve problems within our context in our own way using these tools there are various fantastic innovations that are coming out of the continent um there are very many technology solutions that are very contextual to us and they're solving our problems in a way that we really didn't imagine before and we have technology to thank for that and more than technology to thank for is computer science and digital literacy skills so i think it's really really important to really ensure that all of our young people are getting these skills so that they may be able to translate it in a way that is meaningful to themselves and to their community as well yeah very very interesting here i i hear you loud and clear uh the skill set that they need to to learn now that will prepare them for the future work and even for the world of entrepreneurship so it's uh it's very essential to start together right from now um so what initiatives do the gender of as an organization carry out to support or to provide young learners opportunity to learn computer science about computer science well like i mentioned before we've established code clubs with our partner schools we train a lot of teachers and parents as well with coding skills and computer science skills so that they may be able to carry out this this learning beyond the classroom but one of the other things is that we we want to translate and contextualize coding curriculums in various languages that can be able to be accessible to children across tanzania we're a very diverse country and we want to make sure that this material is being accessed in a language that is friendly um but in also avenues that are very that that are very friendly as well um yeah so we we obviously uh admire the work that africa code week does and code.org as well and that's why we're very happy to continue to learn from you and continue to use uh whatever resources that um that are available to us to also ensure that we're doing our bit uh to empower our communities in tanzania thank you so much nancy for all the great work that you're doing out there so bring us uh bring caroline back to see maybe caroline has one or two questions for you also yes um nancy i wanted to see if you are ready to explore dance party together of course it's a one of our users favorite uh favorite challenge to do on on hour of codencode.org great yes it's definitely one of our favorites at code.org as well um so before we get started in the tutorial i want to talk about the concept of events an event is um an event tells your program to listen for something to happen and then react right away i'm wondering if you think we can create a program with events just the two of us let's try it um so if we paired a letter with a move then that would be an event so i've gone ahead and matched a b and c with three different moves a will be a clap b will be a point move and c will be an arm wave so for example when you say b i will do a point move how does that sound great um so why don't you go ahead and verbally say a mix of a b and c's and i will react all right c a and b that's great um so that was an event we just created that um and now i think that we should take a look at dance party and see how we can use events to make these dancers move so let me go ahead and pull that up great okay so i already have it set up uh so our characters on the screen the cat um but the cat won't be able to move until we add our event block so our event block here when up is pressed what dance move should we have the cat do so we have let's see all of these options shall we try the body roll let's try it and we can have it go to the left or the right which one um the the right yeah okay and it's very important to make sure that we have the cat matched up here or else it wouldn't work um so let's go ahead and run our some our code and i will be pressing the up button amazing he took the body roll um okay great so let's add some measures to the mix um let's connect our event blocks to music measures to make this shark uh dance to music after four measures what should we have the shark do um let's see shall we let's do the double down double down okay to the left or right and i left this time great let's try it that was great i'm thinking it would be pretty boring though to have the same dance move for a full song so what if we change the dance move after a few measures um and let's also add a background um and some backup dancers what do you think the background should be um let's go with tropical just as as an ode to dar es salaam where we are great and we can have an effect as well if we want one um we could go with the laser dance floor okay that sounds like a fun combination um so let's have our front and center character what would we like that to be this time um let's see for troll well let's do it with unicorn okay yeah i like unicorn and then let's have our backup dancers come after four measures so we will add them then what would you like our backup dancers to be well who would typically dance with the unicorn pineapples to watch the tropics oh yeah that works i like that and how many of them should we have maybe not too many right maybe let's try seven because that's a lucky number okay i like your number and what uh format will we like them in um they could go with uh diamond diamond that's great okay so now we have to decide um what the dance moves they're going to do so let's see um after four measures all right let's change it let's let's let the um unicorns start dancing before right they come on i think that would be cool so we need to have the unicorn do what dance uh well they could do refresh fresh i like that and then maybe after four measures when oh we don't need to add that again actually we can put it here um so after forum measures what should we have the pineapples do what goes with fresh should they do the floss yeah let's try that and then do we want to change it so after maybe eight measures they all do something together i could all sort of finish with a let's see they could do uh maybe gangnam okay let's try that one let's go ahead and run it and see how it looks great i hope i won't be asked to reenact all these dances myself it'd be nice to have both of you do that um okay that was great so we could continue on as i'm sure you know and come up with endless creations but instead let's challenge our viewers to experiment on their own and do an hour of code with dance party at home so thanks for helping us dance our way through learning events nancy it's a pleasure thank you nancy thank you i really appreciate it thanks for joining okay so we can bring on uh another great guest yes now we have stella so i'd like to introduce stella uzochukwu dennis stella is an educational technologist electrical electronics engineer a stem evangelist and enthusiast with odyssey educational foundation she is the program coordinator of the invest it build it with the society of women engineers she is also a certified microsoft trainer training teachers on best practices on the use of technology as a tool for teaching named as one of the 25 women in robotics 2017 and an alumni of tech women a program organized by the department of states in the u.s she also serves as an ambassador for girl rising society of women engineers and the new york academy of science wow welcome stella thank you so much lansing i said i'm so sorry caroline it's a pleasure having me today yes it's so great to have you here thank you so much and now i want to pass it back over to audi because he has a few questions for you okay did we lose audio there he is yeah i think he lost me or we we lost everybody okay you lost me for a minute oh that's my they talk to you i see you now i think we're ready to go okay can you see me yet yes we can hello yes okay so that's i that's it happening uh computer freezing up uh so uh i i have a couple of questions for you um you know i i hope you don't mind that i'm starting with the questions so how did you begin to get involved with computer science uh you know we we heard about the great work that you're doing in nigeria for working on robotics working on um coding uh technovation and all this other stuff that you do how did you get involved how did you begin how did you start for you okay um i would like to go back a little bit um to um growing up because it all started for me growing up so i uh i have a first degree in electrical electronics and when i was coming up i saw the link between computer and electrical electronics but um then computers were sacred i mean my younger brother was reading computer science in the same school so i kept visiting him in the department but i saw that the computers they had in their department was separate i mean it was just uh a monument so um that got me thinking now what is in this box you know and all that so but that made me begin to ask questions and then began before you know it my younger brother had to set up a computer science um and a computer hub where he was teaching little kids and then before that we began to think that um we saw one guy i think his name is tiday too one was young he he he he virtually closes his eyes and uses the system and we thought he was a witch i tell you so we have to demystify a lot of things around it so um with time i saw that it was a necessary tool i mean it wasn't just a luxury it was a necessary tool for every child growing up and so um i began to venture ask questions began um and i think that's how i also came across you uh so um and i i did a lot of uh inquiry and then i also got across to code.org and since they had uh a structured curriculum that you can use actually used to teach uh children and in fact what got me um very involved with code that's august the day i saw that they they wrote that it's for kids between it for people between four and hundred and to i think 106 years yeah so i was like wow that's a great one so um basically that's how i got into it and i saw that there was a great gap and skills that kids could learn to help them in their future and of course this is a digital economy i mean we can't run away from it so basically that's how i got involved and entangled in a lot of things around it great interesting uh so you you honestly they i haven't heard anyone explain it better than how you just explained it it's uh it's required for everybody uh it's required for it's lifelong learning it's for kids two to one or six i'll say i'll add maybe a couple more years to that to make it one twenty years of as long as for as long as you leave so um now the pandemic happened last year i was still right in the middle of it how is the job or work on all the eeg all the programs that you've run all those fantastic work that you've been doing over the years that you built up to uh what you was in 2019 how has it changed since the pandemic yeah when we when the pandemic started we thought it was impossible to teach computer science um over a computer so let me just say like that we thought i mean because it needs um handson skills and all that so you actually need to be there for the person to be able to understand um and then a lot of parents who especially here in africa thought it was also impossible for um this kind of skills to be um learnt without you having enhanced a oneonone um field but um the pandemic taught us that and quickly taught us that it's not um it's not um impossible and so we saw that a lot of things began to change in fact i had an inquiry yesterday and i told the person oh we're going to do online said oh i'm fine with it well before now if you say we're going to do an online course for computer they would say it's not possible so um it has changed um our reach because we can actually sit in our offices and be able to reach out to so many more people and at the same time and um just like what is happening before now maybe um code.org would have been you know we have to bring all these people together in a space but right now it's um it's um all changed and the pandemic um made it made us swallow it because by force whether we liked it or not so um my work has changed and i'm able to reach more people at the same time i don't have to travel all the way for me to be able to be involved in a lot of things so um the pandemic has actually changed our work and then more kids have begun to and more parents have begun to understand that we need the device to be able to make your child also participate in augustine so basically that's it very very interesting so i post the same question to the guest who came before you um now we've transitioned from in person handson experiential handson learning uh with people to virtual to you know or hybrid form where you need to teach over the internet and there's a huge a serious issue around access around infrastructure uh there's a big poverty of infrastructure in africa and uh there's very low internet penetration rate in southern part of of nigeria for instance and other parts of africa how are you being able to overcome this with the transition that you're making into virtual uh uh training yeah um i want to say great kudos to code.org i know i was in the um conference two years ago um that was in the worst name of the city i can't remember well it's in one of the cities and um a lot of us mentioned that because of the penetration of um um internet we would want to advocate for offline and we saw that coming so we can actually have these things dumped on our system for everyone to be to partake of it and i heard you while you were giving the opening um um um speech or whatever while you were talking you mentioned that you now have an app so that can actually sit on everyone's phone to be able to start learning to code yeah so um access for internet um and the young man who won the um global teacher award of 100 million two years ago from kenya peter um he does what he does was he what he does for he goes up to eight kilometers or ten kilometers to charge one laptop and then um he's able to download some of the things on it and then come back to school to teach these children and they were able to run on competitions and you know a lot of things so it didn't stop them they were able to because of the um those things he could download so um they didn't have internet in the village where he was teaching but these children did not lack um i mean things that were evident or that were available on the internet so the teacher was also doing that i think he got an award of 100 million two years ago he's from kenya peter so i've invited him i think i met him at the conference two years ago in um in the u.s so i mean um we just learned to solve our problem in a peculiar way so that we don't get cut off because given reasons or excuses for not um being um excluded it's not um it's not um it's not it at all so we should and so um a lot of solutions are coming offline that um everyone can be involved in very good what i heard you say is you you people from virtual i mean from physical to virtual because you have the will and you want to really make this imp you know make an impact on the environment that you live in and whatever obstacles you you you face you're going to try to surmount them and that's uh that that's the spirit that's the spirit yeah so and that leads me to this question what are your key goals as an organization i mean odyssey foundation what are the key goals that you what is your north star where are you heading yeah um we're heading to ensure that um every african child is able to uh be represented on the um cyber space is able to represented i mean have um recognition when it comes to digital technology and um is able to and especially the delta because of course i know what it is in my class we had very few girls and i was a judge recently in one of the programs that had the national association of all um computer science students in the whole of nigeria and we had just four girls and we had over 40 teams so um there's a need for us to um cover up the space and then odyssey educational foundation is running in this space to ensure that the goal of ensuring that every child is not left behind as one of the sdg says and that education too is not does not it's not only for the week and we're trying to ensure that we reach out to the indigent the underserved in nigeria for them to become um to have a voice when it comes to digital technology so basically that's what we do very good it's good to see people like yourself and nancy role modeling that women or girl involvement in a stem or steam or computer science and i i'm sure a lot of girls are watching today and some of them will be reaching out to you to find out how do we key into this how do we become like you or do we uh further career in the in the area of stem uh so what why do you think it's very important i know you talked about this in part but are there other reasons that you think uh are very important for young learners in africa to learn computer science yeah like you also said when you were talking i want to quote you you mentioned that um we love we teach these kids computer science coding and all that not because we want all of them to become computer scientists like you are or we want them to all uh become medical doctors or be in the technology space but like you said the skills they acquire are actually used um to help them become whatever they want to become because right now we're talking about um all of us becoming lifelong learners and those skills like team playing collaboration and all that that we all get while we're learning to code and all that are some of the um skills for the future and then there's the need for every child in africa to also um run and have the skills in them and i mean that will help us become what we want to be in the very near future thank you so much so if uh kids want to get involved in coding or they want to contact otc education foundation how do they reach out to you oh yeah so on facebook as obviously educational foundation we're also on twitter we're on instagram we are also on um on the website just google us and then you find us basically um that's up right and we have mentioned we're global now so i mean um distance is no more a barrier thank you yeah it internet is strong in the world okay so it's a good time thank you so much um stella really appreciate the good work that you're doing in africa most especially in nigeria i think it's the point it's our time again to bring you back caroline and let's do some activities with stella great thank you so much daddy uh stella are you ready to talk about artificial intelligence and machine learning oh sure i am great so artificial intelligence is a really broad term and it basically means anytime a computer does something that seems to be intelligent but before we talk about artificial intelligence let's talk about human intelligence humans are the most intelligent things on earth right but what is it that a human is good at so stella can you help me think of some ways that humans are smarter than other mammals oh yeah humans are smarter than them i really smart because we can descend i can actually descend by looking at your face sometimes when i see you i could say ah caroline it looks you're not happy today did you wake up on the right side you know uh we're able to descend we're able to um recognize patterns i mean if it's happening this way today it must happen this week or very close to this way the next time um we also learn from trial and error so basically that's why we say humans are intelligent and um today i think um machines are beginning to before now we used to say computers we're just garbage in and gabriella right now they are no more so we're adding a lot of stuff on them um learning using them to learn and are teaching them and then they become artificially intelligent so basically i think that's it yeah that was great you really hit the nail on the head there what makes humans unique is discernment intuition and recognizing patterns and learning from trial and error so our brains learn the to do these things and that is what ai is starting to help computers do learning to recognize patterns and trial and error and machine learning is how computers recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed so that's all about what ai for oceans talks about um and i'd like to do a little bit of that activity with you if you are interested right let's get started i'm going to share my screen okay okay so here is our ai bot um it does not know the difference between fish and trash but it can recognize patterns so let's see if we can train the ai bot to learn the difference between fish and trash so is this a fish yes it's a fish okay yeah let's see that's a fish is this a fish yes it's a fish and we get our first sack and that is that 17 billion pounds of plastic into the ocean each year now we're going to keep going this is fish yeah um what about that for fish what about this one trash trash not a fish not a fish not a fish okay a fish a fish a fish a fish another fish and now we get our second fact 80 of ocean pollution comes from land debris and it's estimated to cost 13 billion per year so ai learns from our choices if we make wrong choices ai will repeat our mistakes so the more that we train ai but the better it gets um but let's continue and see how we've done so far so let's see if ai knows what a fish looks like based on what we've already trained to do so let's see okay so here are some objects that ai bot identified as fish and let's see how he did these are fish but we do have a lot of trash in there still and then here's what a i bought identified as trash which is good we only have one fish there on the one place here so if we train ai a lot more maybe we can get to less trash um let's go on to the next so now we're going to train i ai about with a new question and that question is does this object belong in water so we're going to add other sea creatures into the mix and see what happens so ai only learns what we teach it because we didn't get any sea creatures when we were training ai bot so that is an important lesson and we're going to now teach ai bot to um answer the question does this belong in the water so what do we think does this belong in the water yes yes no no yes yes yes the ocean plastic debris can harm fish sea birds and marine mammals protecting seabirds and marine life is one of many reasons to keep the ocean clean okay so let's train ai bot a little bit more no no no yes yes no yes yes no yes yes okay let's go ahead and see how we've done so far with this so we are hoping that ai bot will do a better job identifying the sea creatures before with the new question it's looking okay so far let's pull it up here are objects that belong in water so a lot of them do not too much trash let's see these are the things that don't belong in water oh and that's really good that's all trash so one of the important lessons that we just learned is that it's important what questions you are using to train the machine um so um we um if we continued on with the lawson we'd have the opportunity to train ai more because the more data we give it the better it understands our patterns um so thank you stella for helping us understand how ai and machine learning work thank you thanks and now i'd like to have everyone back on screen so that we can say thanks um we've come to the end of our time together but before we go adi i want to say thank you for being an amazing cohost and audie and i want to thank you nancy and stella both for being guests today we're so excited by the work you both are doing we hope you all at home have enjoyed watching this and take our challenge to do an hour of dance party or ai for oceans on your own so anything you all want to say uh i i can just echo what you said carla thank you so much uh nancy and stella fantastic work you're doing and um you inspire us all day long and uh we just keep you know being you know of your work and uh we're here to support you in any form that you require please reach out to africa code week if you need any of our result resources or code.org if you need anything from the group uh would be more than happy to uh to support thank you so much it's such a pleasure to join you all and to continue to learn and hear of of new progress that you're making in the quest of digital literacy for all i'm really inspired by stella as well um i really am i'm so grateful to have been in this uh in this conversation with you and yeah let's just keep pushing and hopefully um we will be able to to have all uh african children equipped with computer science and contributing meaningfully um in this digital literacy journey yeah thank you all um i'm i'm also very very inspired by what you're doing honestly nancy and um i thank you caroline for putting me on sports today and um thank you um mr judy i call him he knows why that's what i call him so it's my pleasure um being here today and i'm i'm grateful i i did participate today so nancy i think would um catch up beyond now yeah so that people i would like thank you so much
