This lesson is called The Big Event. It's all about how we can control our programs,and actually change the way a program runs on the fly, using Events, like the push of a button, or the click of a mouse. For this lesson, you'll be using a paper controller. It's just like a real life video game. An event is an action, that causes something to happen. It's like when you click the button on a mouse and a webpage loads, that's an event. When you touch your screen on a tablet to scroll, that's an event also. Events are a great way of letting the user direct your program, whenever they need or want to.
