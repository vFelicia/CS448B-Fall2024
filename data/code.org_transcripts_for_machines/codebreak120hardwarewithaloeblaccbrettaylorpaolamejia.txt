so so so hello and welcome to code break my name is hadi i'm the founder of code.org in the hour of code and we're joined by lots of students on zoom on facebook live and on youtube live together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom this is for many of us the last week of school for some people school is already over that's sophie this is your last day of school right yeah um so this will also be our last day of code break and i'm here with my daughter and sidekick sophia who's a budding computer scientist uh i also want to start before we mention the episode to mention that today uh is being a day that's called by uh universities and researchers around the world as shut down stem day which is a movement organized by black organizers and researchers to call on workers and representatives in science technology and math fields to work towards antiracism uh we're very fortunate at code.org to have the platform to speak with you all about it until as we hold our last code break episode as a way to reach our younger students and recognize the antiblack racism that exists in the world and in stem fields and we need to do the work as a larger stem community to fight for black lives and for more diversity in the field of computer science to start today's episode i want to introduce two of our special guests one is paula paola are you there with us i'm here hi honey thank you so much for having me hi it's great to see you paulo as a senior software engineer at microsoft she's going to be joining us for the later part of the episode but you'll see her on screen uh and our first special guest is singer and songwriter aloe blacc i'm doing great how are you it's great to see you alon uh where are you calling us from i am in from los angeles today all right are you still stuck at home or is la able yeah we are still in quarantine we only go out for essentials here in seattle we have some restaurants opening at limited capacity you know it's uh hopefully people more and more around the world will get a chance to to get out a little bit at least over the summer but the pandemic really has not stopped and this is a disease that's going to be coming back i believe in the fall and winter so uh it's been a rough time for all of us do you have any message to share with students who are at home uh whether the ones who've been studying and still in school or thinking about their plans for the summer yeah i think this is a great summer to find what you might be passionate about so explore a lot of different things and since we're here and and you're here at code break maybe this is your passion try to build something amazing come up with some great ideas that's wonderful so we're going to start today's episode with the computer science joke of the day with sophia so sophia you want to share your your joke okay what is an astronaut's favorite key on the computer board on the computer keyboard so astronaut's favorite key on the computer keyboard i would say return because he can't wait to get back home that's a good the answer is the space bar oh my goodness of course of course the space bar yeah i should have thought of that at code.org we write our own jokes and sophia actually wrote a new joke uh when we were practicing today's episode so she has a second joke that today we're learning about hardware so you want to say your hardwarerelated joke it's a little tricky but what does the cpu call its mother the is a part of the computer so what does the central processing unit call its mother oh my goodness i'm gonna go for board i feel pretty close it's the motherboard [Laughter] motherboard the motherboard is actually the board of silicon that the cpu is installed on so it's actually a physical part of the computer all right well uh we now met our special guests let's start by saying hello to our uh the rest of our audience so can we show all the audience on screen and allo if you don't see them all you can hit the gallery button and zoom which will be in your upper right hand corner so you can see everybody if we could unmute everybody to say hello and there's a lot more students as well if you want to see the audience on screen and i'm actually going to share my screen so you can see where people are calling us from so if you see my screen share we have can you all see the map i have here all right so we have audience members as they were joining in basically scanning a qr code and telling us where they're calling from uh aloe i don't know if you expected to see people calling from hawaii some of these are i think fake locations whoever put in greenland i'm guessing is not actually calling from the middle of greenland but we have students from south america from africa from australia india uh and these are live so for many of them they're calling from the their late night or very early morning that's pretty amazing it's a lot of people yeah it's a lot of students from all over trying to learn to code with us together so we're so excited to have you on for our very last code break as we go through this episode if you have questions uh please submit them at code.org questions we're not sure with three special guests this time we're not sure how many uh questions we'll be able to field but also since this is our last code break we're also going to spend some time thanking all the parents and so if you want to give a shout out to your mom or dad you can also go to code.org questions and and put a shout out over there for your mom and dad for today's episode we're going to be talking about hardware and we have three different parts to talk about first we're going to talk about input and output next we're going to talk about the parts inside of a computer and lastly we're going to do some programming using circuits so before we go on to go into some today's lessons i want to welcome some of the students to demo their creations from last week last week we challenged students to make your own sprite live game or app lab drawing using functions and also in the previous week we asked you to use ai and machine learning to train a computer to recognize information so allo we're going to welcome some students who are going to demo what they built for us and if you could uh check them out and and hear from them can we unmute nick hi can you hear me yep we can hear you where are you calling from uh calgary canada calgary and what grade are you in i'm in grade 8. so i'm going to show what you created and so we can present it to aloe as well so nick basically worked on ai to basically do use computer vision and what you see here on the left hand side oops let me share it differently give me a second add what you see on the uh on the left hand side here is a computer vision recognizer he made that recognizes rock paper and scissors so as his hand shows paper the computer recognizes paper when his hand shows scissors and rock on the bottom it shows what the computer is seeing or this middle one shows him showing different facial expressions happy sad and angry and in the bottom you see what the computer is recognizing so he's trained the computer vision algorithm to to basically recognize his emotions and nick can you tell us what this is here on the right hand side the video you sent us uh so this one is um i made it recognize audio clips so the two i chose were for to recognize clapping and snapping all right cool so i'm gonna play the video and you're gonna clap and snap and the computer will tell those apart yep clap snap let me try that again that one really quickly clap snap right so the computer down below is listening to the sounds you make and recognizing and that's pretty cool thanks for learning how to use ai nick and the next student we wanted to uh welcome is sarvika sarvika are you there can we unmute sarvika for a second uh i think she dropped so i'm gonna demo starvika's project briefly and if she gets back i will say hello to her starvika is joining us from india so she might be dropping because it's super late at night for her uh but here we have the game that she created that was built in game lab and it was modeled after the game we created with a rabbit that is feeding carrots to make carrots do but you can control this little scientist and have them drop tools to fix computers and then there's like a bad robot and if the tool gets eaten by the robot you lose so it's kind of a hard game oh no uh am i audible i'm cervical oh hi cervica we're playing i dropped out no worries where are you calling us from i'm from india noida all right and what grade are you in i'm in grade eight great eights well i just played your game and i i wasn't very good at it so i got a game over but thank you so much by the way the code that sarvika wrote there's a lot of lines of code here you can see on the right hand side to make this game in game lab we had made it last week in sprite lab which is much much easier so our whole team at code.org was pretty impressed for for building all of this inside game lab so congratulations for building something uh advanced uh aloe are you there with us too still there you go how you doing right there you are all right so uh thank you again sophia if you could play an applause sound for both starvika and for nick and for all of our students who made special creations last week let's get into today's lesson our word of the day today is hardware and today what we're going to talk about is basically what is hardware and how does it work hardware is basically the physical stuff that is inside of a computer not just inside it but even outside it it's basically the physical parts that work together to make a computer so you may have heard of some of these parts like the cpu which means the central processing unit or the memory which is also called as ram and so on but before we go into hardware i want to talk about what are examples of what a computer even is uh and i want to chat with some of the students to to learn more about it so uh can we unmute uh josiah in north carolina actually i'm gonna mute you myself hottie hi there is nc does that mean you're calling from north carolina uh yes right so can i ask you what are examples of computers besides a laptop what other things do you ever work with that are computers uh you mean like huh i work with apple tv apple tv is a computer aloe can you think of examples of things that are computers besides just laptops yes sometimes i walk around with a computer in my pocket that's my phone that's right your cell phone how about you sofia um an ipad an ipad is a computer if you have a smart watch that's a computer but also if you have a navigation system in your mom or dad's car that's a computer the satellites that go around the world in space like on anuj's background screen those are computers if you have smart screens on your microwave or on your uh or you know on your fridge that's a computer and if you've ever seen if you've ever seen a calculator that's actually a computer every calculator is a computer uh in our very first episode of code break hill harper walked us into his shower that had a touch screen and that was a computer most modern medical equipment uses computers today the smallest computers could be so small that they're microscopic you literally can't even see it with your eyes and their computers so the question i want to ask is what makes a computer a computer what defines that something is a computer versus something else every computer has four things and what these four things have to do generally with are processing information it first takes an input then it stores that information it processes the information and then converts it into output of some sort inputs means sort of the physical world's telling something to the computer then it processes and works that input into some other form of information and then outputs that now that could mean like doing math or changing something by words but there's lots of different ways to give input to a computer you might click a key on the keyboard so can we think of different ways you can give input to a computer at kayleen i'm going to call on you kayleen can you hear me yeah i can hear you all right so can you think of other ways you can give input to a computer besides touching on a keyboard well there are touch screen computers like you can touch on the screen but um those touch screen computers are more expensive than the keyboard ones and they're more easier to use some other computers you can flip them to tablets and things like that exactly so the touch screen that feels your touch that's an input device can anybody share another type of input into a computer all right uh alexander oops yes yep where are you calling from oshkosh wisconsin all right so what's another example of a computer input pretty much with like um like coding with like websites because when you like let's say like you want to like pick like an item from like a computer you have to like um you have to like search up the item and they'll show you to show you on some like items that are so when you're using the website it wants you to give information and you could use your keyboard to type that information but is there some other thing you can use like when if you want to give it if you want to choose something from a drop down menu what do you use to choose to make that selection what are you moving around you the mouse the mouse exactly the mouse so uh thank you so much alexander so input devices for computer all the things that take something from the physical world the world of touch the world of sound the world of light so the camera on a phone that's taking input the microphone on a phone or computer that's taking input you speak to it or it hears noise and that receives that information whether it's touch sound site even things like the gps locator on your phone it's locating where you are in the world these are all inputs and then the computer uses that information to output something aloe can you give us an example of what are some ways a computer can output information yeah um well i make music so i love the speakers on a computer that's my favorite part of output on a computer sometimes but i also make music videos so um the screen is an output and it's offering the information uh through that output yep so the sights and sounds you get from a computer or from your phone are output but there's again many types of output like on sophia's phone here there's a flashlight that makes light or if you have a computer that's controlling physical equipment the output can control that like if your car has a smart braking system the output of the computers the brakes on the car or if you have a robot uh the movement of that robot is controlled by the output of a computer or if a computer is inside maybe a microwave uh it turns on or off the microwave that's the output every computer does these four things of taking in input storing and processing it and then outputting and that input can be light or sight or touch and the output can be sound or sights and so on now i want to do something unique we're going to act out the different parts of the computer today with all the students on camera so in the background we're going to have this screen share that shows all of you on screen and what we're going to do is we're going to have five different computers on screen at so basically each of you in one of these vertical columns that you see is going to be a computer consisting of four people so we see five computers each one is a vertical row uh and so that's computer number one is started with me and sophia computer number two is with naomi and so on and so forth and the top row is going to be input the second row is going to be storage the third row is going to be processing and the fourth row is going to be output so look look at where you will look at where you are in the computer on the screen and you'll see which computer number uh column you fall under and you'll see what part of the pr um the computing stage you are in the on the roads right so alexander who's raising his hand he's part of the processing for computer number three yep or aloe is part of computer number three storage so all right so now all of our computers are going to do something so if you're in the input row i want you to grab a piece of paper and also if you're in the in a pen and if you're in the output row also grab a piece of paper and a pen so if you grab a piece of paper because we're part of input for computer number one so we're using paper because the original computers and this the first computers used paper as their only way of input and output before there were microphones and cameras and even keyboards on a computer the earliest computers you fed them information on a card with little holes in it and then they printed out information after they very true and that's those were the machine the machine computers that the word computer is basically referring to a human being who would compute information so if you were the person to do the work you were called the computer yep exactly so what i want everybody in the input row i want you to use your pen to pick a number between one through five and draw that many dots on your paper make them big dots so that we can see them when you hold them up to the camera sophia can you draw one of these so any number a number between one to five don't make it too big of a number because because that's too many dots and make them thick dots so that when you hold them up to the camera we can see them all right sophia can you show your number good job zion thank you nikki great job naomi all right so all right come on thank you right we've got all these numbers on screen so everybody who's in storage i want you to use your fingers to show how many dots you see from the input above you so look at the number above you and hold up that number of dots and hold them up using your fingers and make sure we see them now if you're holding up your hand to show the dots make sure you keep your hand up don't bring it down your job is to remember what was there so even when the dots disappear keep your hand up all right all right so now can the dots go away all the pieces of paper i want you to write down a new number of dots pick a different number you can maybe add a and again pick a number between one to five the handson screen don't don't bring your hands down because you're still remembering the previous number so let's see a new number on screen okay sophia has one dot all right nikki can you hold yours down just a bit so we can see there you go all right so can whoever is doing the drawings on the screen stop doing that right so now uh for everybody who's in processing the third row of the computer take a look at the number you see in storage which is the one the row the second row and then look at the new inputs and add them together so you see one number that's being stored in memory which is the first time we hold up the dots then a new number which is the new input and add these two together and show that with your fingers on the screen so you see for example sophia is holding one dot and right above her kayleen is showing three fingers so one plus three is four and naomi is showing two dots and power lies that's your one dot right so now everybody who's basically doing processing is showing a new number alexander can you hold your number up higher so we can see it okay you're gonna alexander i'm holding up three because that's the memory that was in storage and nicki's holding up two because that's the new number so you have to add those together two plus three there you go thanks alex all right so we all have numbers showing so now the dots can stop showing their inputs and what i want but for the processing folks don't change your numbers now if you're an output now write down the number you see in processing right above you so and people in processing make sure your numbers are very obvious if folks can write down and write it down as a number not as dots so if you see the number four you write down the number four and all right so anjali is writing down six great job kate all right and kate wrote down the number five all right well thank you so much guys so uh i think somebody just dropped off the camera which kind of changes this a little bit for us so what we just did is we showed the different parts of a computer basically involve inputting information which in our case the input was a piece of paper remembering that information which said even if the paper changed you remember what's going on processing that information in our case we just did very simple addition and then getting the results and outputting them and the output we did was with paper now we did this with pen and paper but the inputs and outputs of a computer can be completely different the input could be a sound you get from the microphone and then you record that sound inside the computer in the memory and the processing of that sound could be like a you know changing the volume or remixing it and then outputting the sound comes out for the speakers everything a computer does and what defines what a computer is is those four things of input storing information processing that information and outputting it and every computer whether it's a tablet a gaming desktop a phone the car gps system all of those do those same four things we have an entire video series about how computers work that goes into a lot more detail and we're going to share that at the end of this episode for folks to watch it's about 50 minutes of videos and it features bill gates himself who created one of the most popular computer operating systems ever to explain to you that these parts of a computer and how they work so uh before we say goodbye to aloe i want to uh do a lightning round with you aloe so aloe you're our sixth and final special guest to play our lightning round game uh sophia is going to put 60 seconds on the clock and she's going to keep score you're going to be getting a bunch of quick questions and your goal is to see how many questions you can answer in 60 seconds okay our high score was set by macklemore who got 14 answers uh in in 60 seconds oh my goodness yeah it's kind of hard it's pretty high stress but i'm sure you'll do okay sophie you ready yes aloe you ready yes all right go what are your feelings about pineapple on pizza i love it something you can't every no matter how many people love it jalapenos your favorite smell jasmine your favorite article of clothing hat strangest thing in your refrigerator hummus something you wish you could have learned as a kid coding what's your best advice you've ever gotten study the greats as a kid what did you want to be when you grew up a neuroscientist what is the superhero power you wish you had automatically create food first thing you do in the morning check my email what were your hobbies when you were a kid riding bikes um okay you got 10 which is really good all right great that's great and by the way aloe meant you mentioned that you wanted to learn coding but aloe's actually one of the reasons we've highlighted aloe not only in this episode but on on many code videos as well is because when the internet first came out allah was one of the first musicians to create his own website and to use that to promote his music and it's an important lesson that even if you want to become a rock star or an athlete whatever field you want to go into understanding how technology works is super important as well thank you um so alan i know we're out of time and we're running late for your schedules can we switch to gallery view and have everybody say goodbye to aloe as we add yvonne with our episode bye everybody thank you all right it's been a pleasure thank you so happy learning bye bye before we welcome our next special guest i want to take a quick break for a short trivia question so it's trip video time so the question is what does the acronym bios stand for bios and if you're not on the zoom call the options are booting info on startup the next option is basic input output system the third option is bytes in operating system and the fourth option is begin input output scan right so almost half of our audience has already voted on these so what does the acronym bios stand for all right it sounds like most people got this right if we could share the results on screen almost all of you got it correct so the basic input output system uh what that is or the bios of a computer it's like the operating system but it's at a much more detailed sort of lower level thing basically the bios is the little bit of code that runs the immediate moment when you turn on a computer when you immediately turn on the phone it's the thing that tests to make sure that all the inputs and outputs work that there is a keyboard that the memory actually exists that the wires are actually working and so on and once this step is complete it then actually loads the real operating system which could be windows or android or ios and then passes control of the computer to the operating system which then takes over and manages everything that happens so i want to welcome our second special guest at today brett are you here with us i'm here hi brett it's great to see you where are you calling us from uh calling from lafayette california which is uh right next to oakland california if any of you know where that is uh well i know where that is but uh i wanted to ask sort is is where you at are people out and about yet are you still in quarantine mode are you staying at home or can you get together we're still sheltering in place um though some businesses are opening up so um it's a little bit more normal than it was though uh still you know the kids are i have three kids uh 10 uh eight and five and um a lot of their summer activities are still at home yeah it's rough to be spending summer at home uh brett by the way for those of you who didn't read our introductions is currently the president of salesforce he used to be the chief technology officer of facebook and he's also the cocreator and inventor of google maps which i know i use pretty much every day at least when i'm not sheltering in place or quarantining brett can you share us a little bit about your involvement with google maps how old were you when you were working on google maps uh and can you tell us a little bit about the the project that got that going yeah sure i was i was 25 years old when we launched google maps and actually 24 years old turned 25 a couple months after so really it was at my first job right out of university i'm at google and for me when i think about it i think that most of the really cool products that you use um that are created by code are done by teams and it was interesting when i i feel really proud that i helped make google maps because so many people around the world use it now hundreds of millions of people use it but it was really a whole team that did it we had one engineer on the team named jens who was really good at drawing um so he was responsible for all the way the maps looked um which you know at the time was uh i think was one of the most beautiful maps and it really helped people want to use google maps over some of the other mapping technologies at the time my friend jim he was best at algorithms and so he designed the algorithm that helped make driving directions work so when you say you know i want to go from san francisco to new york you can imagine how many different ways you could do that how many different roads you could drive on he came up with a way to find the best route to take into account how fast the highways were the different speed limits really really complicated math and he was the best at that and i spent a lot of time on the user interface which is really i think a fun topic you're talking about inputs and outputs i um wrote all the code that um so when you took your mouse and you dragged the map i made it move in the right way um and that was really my specialty and on the other side of that the team of about five of us made google maps and now there's a much bigger team working on it but it was one of those fun coding projects of my life it's pretty awesome if only five people made the first version and pretty much everything we use in technology that we sort of society upholds sort of individuals as the inventors but they're always made by teams of people behind them doing different parts and since today we're learning about the different parts of a computer such as input and output one thing that made google maps special before all the other compared to all the maps that came before it is in the past anytime you wanted to move the map the entire map would need to load start to bottom and you couldn't even move your mouse left and right to drag the mouse drag the map we are now accustomed the idea on a touch screen you touch and you move it and you give it the input and then the output which is the monitor shows basically the map scrolling and google maps was really the first version that did that uh and when it happened and people saw that for the first time was a pretty magical experience that now you take for granted yeah i mean what's so fun about talking about input and output is it sounds so simple but honestly it's the most important part of the way we work with computers you know back when hottie and i started coding the way you talk to a computer was just through a text interface so you typed on a keyboard and you saw text come back on the screen and then it became a graphical user interface so you could see pictures on the screen and you could use a mouse along with a keyboard to both input things into computer and see the output and that was really as you said hottie with google maps we realized you know the modern mapping systems weren't taking advantage of all these new ways that you could input and output data from the computer and when we thought of a creative new way of doing it it really changed mapping forever but actually the most interesting part of google maps wasn't even created by us i think was created by steve jobs who is the um obviously the founder of apple um who makes iphones like this one right here you know when they introduced this they introduced a new way to input into a computer which was your finger and i think i can say that the moment i took my finger and dragged a google map i thought wow this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life and so you know i think when you think about all the cool things you're going to make with code a lot of the new experiences we make are because of new ways of input and new ways of output and i'm really excited about virtual reality i'm really excited about you know new forms of user interfaces being created all around the world right now and i think the way you all will code for computers 10 years from now is going to be really different than the computers of today and that's pretty exciting so we're going to learn a little bit about the graphical user interface inside coding which has also changed a lot and i know that your kids use code.org we're going to switch to uh codingoncode.org to complete a game that sophie and i are gonna be coding uh to basically learn about the parts inside of a computer so i'm gonna share my screen and what you see here is code.org sprite lab and we've started this game with these really cool graphics that we're very very proud of and this kind of fancy looking computer that we're gonna put together and if i run the game i can put the different parts inside the computer so this here is the cpu on its motherboard and this here is a memory and brett can you find any input devices that i can attach to this computer yeah why don't we start with maybe the keyboard the keyboard is one of the inputs all right any other input devices i think a mouse is a good input device that's another input device and as output we have this little black thing which is our monitor doesn't really look like a monitor but the screen on your laptop is black until you turn it on uh and that's basically the output that shows what's on your screen uh and then this last part is the power cord but we can't drag it because this part doesn't work yet and i want to turn the computer on by clicking on it but that doesn't work because it doesn't have any power so that's the part that sophia and i are going to be coding right now so i'm going to stop this for a second and before we get into the coding i wanted to point out that this little thing here was not even draggable all the other sprites on the screen were draggable and the way that happened is something that happened in the starter code here when you see reset game this is basically a function we wrote last week we learned about abstraction and how functions can have lots of code inside them so if i click the edit button here you can see all of the code that goes into starting the game uh you don't need to know what all this code does it basically sets things up but sophia if you go to the very very bottom it makes all the sprites on the screen draggable so the keyboard is draggable and the mouse is draggable and so on but the power unit is not draggable so go into behaviors and then say sprite begins and add that in there and now you can make rabbit draggable but not the reaction but not the rabbit yeah let's make the power unit draggable and then go into behaviors and say being draggable so now your power unit is draggable oops it's glitchy is it glitching for you right now hit close all right and now hit start so we can yes hit run so we can see if the power unit is draggable right draggable but it's not clicking into place like those other things did so let's write the code to make it click right so if you look on the screen it shows what happens right now when the memory chip touches the computer i'm going to refresh the screen share because it's glitching a little bit for people so i'm going to start this over give me just one second i'm going to stop the show can i share a story about building a computer sure go ahead yeah so when i was a kid um i couldn't afford a computer from a computer store but it was cheaper if i bought all the parts of a computer and i built it myself so if i bought the memory and i bought the cpu and i bought the case and the first time i did it i had this exact same top problem hottie which is i finished doing it and i screwed it in with a screwdriver and i turned it on and it didn't work and i had to take the entire thing apart and i had forgotten to connect the power supply to the cpu and the computer wouldn't turn on and so one it's one engineering principle that i think is really important is always test the entire way you know when you're writing code don't wait to the end to see if your code's working always run it and see what happens i learned that the hard way when i was building my first computer a true story that's wonderful yeah and that's why we tested at the mouse that the power unit was draggable before we jumped into doing anything else and i hope this works right now so i'm going to run this code again and we can drag the power unit but it doesn't click into place but at least the code that we wrote does something so now if you look at this code here this shows what happens how we make it lock into place we want to do something like this which is how the memory locks into place so we're going to recreate something like that so start with creating an event block and so you see when the rabbit touches the carrot but we don't have a rabbit or a cat but we can say when the power unit touches the computer we want to make it click into place yeah someone's drawing so what happens when the power unit touches the computer first thing we want to do is make it stop being draggable and then being draggable yep but right now you said make the rabbit stop being grabbable and then the other thing we want to do is we want to have it jump and lock into place see how it says jump this memory unit jumps to a location so go into actions and have the sprite jump and instead of a random location we want to pick our own location so go into locations and see that little thing with a pin in it it's right in the middle click that and choose a location kind of halfway between the power yeah a little bit yeah that's that's a good location over there yep that's good so now let's hit run and see if that works it's glitching oh did it lock in a bad place i'm gonna oh it's because you have the rabbit jumping we need to make this be the power unit so this is exactly as brad said we need to test every step of the way i'm glad we tested to see what the problem was there so if we hit run now click run again and you can move it and it jumps into place perfect but we want to make a sound when it jumps into place as well so can you go into the world and choose play sound all right and now we can choose a sound all right let's gonna choose a digital sound so we have let's pick some of these choices play the ring one and then start up play the whistle and the win all right we're going to choose one of these sounds brett do you have a favorite and let's also pull the entire i like the win that made me laugh all right let's house the whole audience and we'll play the sounds and so we can choose uh so ring startup whistle and win all right and let's share the audience poll results i think everybody else agreed with you brett uh so we're gonna go with the win right uh and then the last thing we want to do is we can actually uh if you look what is happening here when we're adding these commands if you look above there's a command here that says change parts by one what that's doing is incrementing a variable which is something we learned a few weeks ago and if the reason is doing that it's counting how many parts we put inside the computer because at the end we're going to test and see if parts reaches 6 we'll let the computer turn on so basically we need to increase this variable as well so we're going to need to choose one of the variable codes to change change parts by one um and i think that's good you hit the run button now this should all work put the other parts in the inputs the outputs we got the storage of processing and then put the power and now you can turn on the computer yay yay it all works yeah we can i wanted to leave that for the audience to do later so there's lots of things you can add to this first of all you can change the look and feel of the power unit once it's connected we have a little costume you can change light up and show power uh but we're going to share this app with you so you can actually sophie you can do that right now while i'm talking about it so you can add the costume if you want um so this app that we just made is very simple but we're going to let you extend it so you can add other computer parts you can have other sort of parts like more memory and so on you can add other inputs and outputs and if you want to do something advanced you can actually go go further and make an actual smartphone version of this so you put the parts inside of a smartphone together and we'll send that to you as part of your challenges the other cool thing and brad i don't know if you've seen this is we can share this out to everybody so this app that we made we're going to share and if you see that little qr code if you have a phone with you which bret i saw that you had you can scan that qr code on that on your phone right now and you'll get a little notification so you need to turn on your phone's camera and then if you just hold it up to that qr code it'll show a little notification and then you can get the app that we just put together that's awesome yeah and then you can play it on your own computer you can play it on your own and it works just like we just did so you can have fun making a computer and this time don't forget to connect the power supply and it'll start working so before we say goodbye to brett just one thing i want to say today we're joined by some teachers along uh who are basically computer science principals teachers who are graduating this year uh cs principles is the most popular computer science course in america's high schools right now and these teachers have students who are graduating and as you know they've all been basically studying at home for the latter part of the year many of them had to take an ap exam uh as part of that and we wanted to give a special shout out to the students who worked so hard to accomplish their goals in the midst of a global pandemic before we say hi to these folks i want to do an audience poll to ask how many of the students joining us right now are graduating this year and this means whether you're a senior in high school or whether you're you know in elementary school in fifth grade and leaving your school and going to a new school how many of you are graduates or from eighth grade to yeah or ending middle school to go into high school so wow i did not expect to see so many graduating students this year it's pretty awesome to see how many of our students are it's amazing congratulations everyone so we haven't shared the poll results if we could share those yeah about a quarter of all the students on code break are graduating so what a special moment today we congratulate all of you for your graduation and i wanted to invite a teacher uh to join us so is shanti there i'm here hi shanti where are you calling us from i'm calling from ohio cleveland ohio cleveland ohio it's so great to meet you and thank you for all of your hard work helping your students make it through this year uh i know you were hoping to have some of your graduating students join us as panelists but i think it was hard to put together can you read out the names of your students you have some students are actually here though as well um they're they're on as well um so uh mary hudson she's here she just waved uh ashanti hamilton she's under shayla sharp and um so those two are here with us along with some other uh cs students but our other cs graduates are jefferson agitate janaya wheeler rihanna blanchett anaya clark jonathan clay the saint chesney marquita edwards mylena edwards camario malone jalen debose nyla house davion mosley dalita powell samaj stewart tamaya williams and davon thank you so much uh we're gonna unmute everybody uh and to clap for all these students and brett if you don't see all those students you can click this button to to see all the faces and shantae you're calling from cleveland ohio is that right yes but um we i teach at shaw high school in east cleveland ohio awesome all right so let's unmute everybody in the audience thank you and brett uh you know we give a round of applause for shanti students but if you want to share some words to congratulate not just shanti students but the many hundreds of students who are joining us on code breaker graduating and who aren't getting their own graduation ceremony if you want to share some final words with them well i also say congratulations uh it's such an achievement to graduate and in particular right now in this completely unprecedented time it's so hard to be uh sheltered in place in our homes and and to not get the celebration of some of these graduations but i just want to say so many of the great technologies we've used are created by young people and by students so take all the skills you've learned and take all the creativity you have and the beginners mind you have about um what you want to create and create the future i'm looking forward to seeing all the the cool things you all build with the skills you learned this year thank you so much well thank you so much brett and we're going to say goodbye to brett if you could play an applause sound sofia avaya and it was great to see you and thank you for joining us thank you for having me and uh it was really nice to meet you all right byebye and i'd like to now welcome back our third and final guest senior software engineering manager at microsoft powell mejia welcome paola hi heidi thank you so much for having me hi there uh and sofia you can uh head out sophie's gonna say goodbye to us and we're gonna be joined by my son darius hi hey there is how are you darius is 13. paolo where are you calling us from i am calling from seattle washington just like you and you've worked on many tools that many students are familiar with like microsoft office 365 or bing and microsoft teams can you share with us a little bit about your back story and what it took to become a software engineer at microsoft yeah yeah absolutely so my journey with microsoft actually started back when i was in college in my senior year i did an internship in the summer of 2006 and then i joined fulltime at microsoft in 2007 and over the span of all these years i have worked in office you know which is the family of products like ward and excel and powerpoint um and then i was there for some time i transitioned to bing.com and i was there for about seven years and my last role has been in microsoft teams so i have been there for about three years and that one has been by far you know one of the most exciting products i've worked on i'm not sure you know maybe some of you guys have had the chance to join some online classes or do some video calling using microsoft teams um we're building a collaborative platform you know to facilitate education and collaboration in the workspace but overall it has been a fantastic ride at microsoft i have been there for about 13 years and it's been full of great opportunities to learn new technologies and also to work with a lot of really talented people and you did a lot of internships when you were trying to get get effective into your career can you talk a little bit about that yeah so when i was actually in college i i was trying to apply for an internship at microsoft um i think it took about three attempts to get to the final internship offer during my years in school i was primarily focused on extracurricular projects you know while i was building a strong resume and i was getting more expertise in the technical field one of the things that i did when i was back in school was the imagine cup competition i actually made it to the finals on national stage in mexico and that's where i was born and raised and and where i went to school so um gaining all of that experience since i was uh in school really helped me towards my journey being a software engineer in the tech field and was your internship at microsoft yes yeah i did that internship at microsoft so just two weeks ago we actually met with scott forstall who uh he did his first internship at microsoft as well and he moved on to work at apple and was one of the inventors of the iphone said you can start with an internship at a tech company and move on to create great things so i can't wait to see what you do further on in your career thank you so we want to move on to the last part of our episode which is to learn about circuits because today we're learning about hardware we started learning about input and output in the different aspects of what a computer does and then the parts inside the computer now we want to actually write code to control a circuit this is really different than anything we've done and i'm going to actually share my screen soon to show you but what we're going to do is we're going to write code to code this circuit which is an adafruit circuit playground it uses a architecture called arduino which is a very popular way of basically controlling really small circuits you can purchase one of these it costs about twenty dollars and we're going to send a link to you at the end if you want to and if you look at this thing it has lots of inputs and outputs on it so for example right here there's little buttons you can click uh and around it there are lights but there's lots of other inputs and outputs for example it has an accelerometer that detects if i'm turning it or moving it it even has a temperature sensor inside it and a microphone to hear sound uh do you have uh thoughts on any of those in terms of what those can be useful for yeah so um i mean you can think of circuit boards being present pretty much everywhere in our lives right like if you think about the temperature um like a thermostat for example the ones that we have at home you know it's it's another way of taking information from um an external source and process that and then have an output to tell you something exactly so now we're gonna i'm gonna screen share and this is a slightly different type of screen share for me uh and i'm gonna show us how we do the code to control this circuit so i'm gonna screen share portion of my screen can you all see uh yeah i can see it it's okay and there's two versions of my video now so i'm gonna stop one of them to simplify this so what we see here on the left hand side is app lab which you're comfortable with and here's an app that we're making and all the code for it but i did something here i clicked this gear and i chose to enable the maker toolkit which added a whole new category of commands here see here where it says circuit these are all the blocks that manage things that can happen with this circuit board now over here is the code that controls what our app does and it uses some of these blocks and what we're going to do is we're going to create an app that lets you doodle and draw but using the board as the controller not the mouse a few weeks ago we had the founder of instagram show us how to make an image doodler where you move the mouse around and you draw on the screen and you could choose different colors or you could change the thickness of your drawing but the input device for the drawing was a mouse i want to use this little thing as our input device and the input is going to be by moving it around we're going to draw on the screen and we've already started this code up here it basically has a function here saying onboard event when the accelerometer makes an event and the accelerometer is going to give us a pitch and a roll the pitch is when we move it forward and backwards and the role is when we turn right or left and those those are basically the inputs and outputs of this device and uh you can see here the code that basically text gets the pitch from the accelerometer and it gets the roll from the accelerometer so darius here is going to add some very simple code that allows the pitch and roll of this thing to control the drawing on the screen so we want to use the turtle drawing commands so go into turtle and then say move forward but instead of moving forward 25 pixels move forward pitch pixels so if my pitch is positive and i'm leaning forward it'll move forward that many and if it's negative and moving backwards it'll go backwards and then also now turn right and turn right how what should you turn by how many degrees the roll which is how much we're going left and right so enter the roll there oops you misspelled it all right and just like the examples you were saying about the computers right like when you take an input from something else like the mouse and in this case it's gonna be the movements that you do back and forth and left and right right exactly the inputs are what we get from the accelerometer and the outputs are the move forward and turn right which controls what shows up on the screen so there is can you hit run and i'm going to see if this works all right so i'm leaning forward and it moves forward and then i lean back and it moves backwards and then if i turn right it goes in this crazy circle if and you can change the colors as i'm drawing too if you want oh cool wow and this all right this is going a little bit out of control it's kind of hard to draw with this because it's moving kind of too fast so can you reset it yeah all right so that was going too fast so what could we do to actually make it not move so fast so i can control this more more carefully oh we could do like move forward my pitch divided by like eight all right so you're gonna do some so we'll still go in the direction of the pitch and roll but you're dividing it by some numbers that so it doesn't go quite as aggressively we'll see maybe it's still too fast all right i'm gonna try it again and you can change the colors all right i'm going to lean forward and it's moving forward then i'm going to turn right and i'm going to oh you made it thicker i'm going to turn left that doesn't do anything right now oh so as i'm moving forward i can even move backwards by leaning backwards all right this is kind of fun but one problem with this is basically it's continuously drawing and if i want to stop the drawing i can't lift up the pen and white ink yeah white well white ink you can lift up my face it's an eraser so can you hit reset for a second so there's these buttons on this this left and right button i want to make those macy lift up the pen and put down the pen so we can draw something more complicated and so we can do that using events which we learned about last week so you can even put us into show blocks now if you go into the circuit block area there's an onboard event if you drag that out it enables events so it says onboard if in the event of a button left being down so that's basically that's the left button so when that's down what should we do pen up pen up so i'm going to turtle and say pen up pen up and let's do the opposite for the button right so what can we do there paulo you want to help us as well we can we can say on event band button r yeah yeah and then from the turtle we could do pen down and you know this circuit also can make sounds so i want to make it so when we press these buttons we actually hear some sounds coming out of this board yeah on the defense so can you go back to the circuit blocks and can you paula help us see if you can see anything that sounds buzzer note i think here let's do buzzer notes yeah um e4 i think a4 means like the abcde notes on a keyboard yeah okay and that 100 is the duration so we can change that to make it longer or like something else if it's 100 duration that's gotta be milliseconds can we pick a different sound for the other one here let's do c4 yeah four one thousand no we're not ten all right now let's run that and see what happens okay so now if i lean forward it should draw and if i hit the right button the pin is down the left button lifts the pen so now i'm moving around i can turn right and turn left and then right button puts the pen down and makes that little sound and the left button lifts it can you all hear the sound it's making yeah i can hear it right this is not easy to control it's like flying an airplane yeah you can try um i actually want to ask the audience to suggest something for us to draw here oh go ahead you can try um let's do an audience poll for what we can try to draw now with this cool little tool we've got uh there's oops this is on the screen so there's i want to make this easy for me so choose a plus sign please the plus sign is the easiest thing to draw plus sign can can everybody vote for a plus sign because the cat is very popular i think the plus sign is what i want people to vote for yeah i could draw the character it'll it might look like a government all right let's share let's share the poll results okay so it sounds like nobody wants to have me draw a plus sign we'll have to try drawing a cat uh all right so this is not going to be easy at all but i i'm going to try drawing a cat i'm gonna lift up the pen or i'll turn it down and very so you can control the colors if you want so this will be the cat face i'm gonna do the outline of the cat face oh my gosh this is so hard ah this is like an ear it looks like an ear oh no great this is actually better than i thought it would be because i'd practice it a little earlier all right i'm going backwards now it's going in reversal it connects oh not as good as we're going to get on the cat face it's a really nice cat can you help me with the eyes make the eyes a different color all right where should i make the eyes that's one eye no this cat has giant eyes all right i think this is as good as we're gonna get with the cat you can try making the whiskers if you want so what we oops you hit reset well what we learned there is how to write code that controls inputs and outputs you know when you use commands like move forward or turn right that's putting drawings on the screen and that's controlling the circuits inside your computer that actually put stuff on the screen but whether you're handling a computer or a chip like this the inputs and outputs start as being really simple like little buttons and an event that detects a mouse move is just like an attempt an event that detects a button being down or a command that says move forward or turn right is just like a command that says play the buzzer note in every one of these cases the code you're writing is controlling the inputs and outputs on the screen and when a computer works it receives information through the inputs it runs code to basically manage processing that information and it runs code to basically store that information process it and then uses output whether to show something on the screen to play a sound etc thank you so much for being patient with my terrible airplane drawing skills uh so we shared that app with you but there's a lot more you can do with it and if you want to give us your email address just can you hear me some of those things we want we'll send you instructions for how you can actually make your own using the same board uh so if we don't already have your email address you can go to code.org break code.org break and if you sign up here we'll be able to send you today's challenges for you to try out and there's a bunch of things you can get in these challenges first of all we'll send you the short video series i mentioned about how computers work and that's going to basically be this 40 minute long video series that talks about the different parts of a computer and how they actually work at detail and it features bill gates the founder of microsoft explaining the insides of a computer then we'll send you that sprite lab game that sophia and i worked on together and you can add to that project by adding speakers or a camera or more memory and make a more complicated uh computer inside that game and then lastly if you're able to purchase a circuit playground they cost 20 bucks we'll send you a link for one of those then you can use app lab to do much more complicated stuff than the little drawing thing that darius and i just did uh you know you can we'll obviously send you the app that we just made so you can improve on it and play with it the way i just did but we'll also send you ideas for other projects you could do so since this is our very last episode of quote break i wanted to spend some time to give a special thanks to all the parents and teachers who've been joining us and who've made it possible for their children to tune in to code break and participate in their activities first of all if you want to give your own shout out to a parent to your mom and dad please use our question form as i sent earlier about code.org questions and i want to do a quick audience poll how many of the students for joining us today are watching with their parents many of you i know are just watching code break alone but a whole bunch of you are doing here with you with your parents next to you and we want to do something special to recognize all the parents all right if you could share the poll results so it looks like one third of our audience is actually joining us with the parents paola uh before we go thanking our parents can you share a little bit about your own parents and how they helped you as you were getting into computer science yeah absolutely um so i was born and raised in mexico and i grew up in a city called veracruz which you know where the opportunities to learn computer science were very limited so both of my parents are chemical engineers my mom was actually the first female engineer in the family and they really wanted to support me in a journey where i had all the tools to face a world that's constantly changing so without their support i wouldn't have been able to make it to where i am today um you know but between my parents and also my teachers um they taught me that you know there may be a lot of no's along the way but it only takes one yes to get the the next opportunity and to get on the right track so to the moms and dads joining us today thank you thank you for being there thank you for making a difference i want to thank my parents specifically they have been so inspiring to me and honestly without them i don't think i would have been able to accomplish everything i have that's wonderful one thing that studies have shown is that encouragement from a parent is one of the most important things to keep to basically ensure persistence of young kids in computer science especially among girls or students of color who are typically underrepresented in the field encouragement from their parent is one of the most important ways to get them to stick with it i'd like to invite our producer akira who missed last week's episode to also join me and to read out some of the shout outs to parents from all the students tuning in at home so akira can you join us on screen for a second yes thanks hattie so we have a couple of shout outs to parents um we have one from aniola from the past manitoba in canada and they say i want to thank my mom and dad as they are both essential workers my mom works at a hospital and my dad is a teacher so i think there's accommodation all around on that one dominic says i'd like to give a shout out to my grandma for letting me do code break so i'm really glad that we have grandma's encouragement and finally we have adees and caleb from maddie reading massachusetts and i believe both of them have joined us as former panelists on code break and they said our parents mocta and sent yahoo we want to thank them for working so hard to support us and take care of us not only during this quarantine but for our whole lives they're our main inspiration to learn thank you so much uh and if you could uh just briefly if darris could play an applause sound uh hold on this is coming in right here and i want to basically make a special thanks if we could basically go to gallery mode and basically give a round of applause uh if we could unmute all the students a round of applause to thank all of our students and all of our panelists our parents to to to congratulate the graduating seniors as well as their teachers and lastly a special thanks to our special guests this week alo uh brett and paula i lastly want to say you know this is our very last code break so we're done and we're going to say goodbye to you but if you want to continue learning you can go to code.org at home all the tools and games and things we've learned about are there and there's a whole bunch of other activities we'll be emailing this to you as well and lastly if you want to help support code.org if you want to buy a hat like my cool hat or a tshirt like the one sophia was wearing you can go to code.org shop or you can just google for code.org on amazon and then lastly all of our work is only made possible thanks to generous charitable donations so if any of the parents want to support code.org if you go to code.org help that's the best way for you to basically help the work that we're doing there's many millions of students who learn computer science and coding on code.org we've had we just passed 50 million students on code.org we want to reach 50 million more students and we only need your help to do that thank you so much everybody who's been with us throughout the last three months of the quarantine uh this is our very last code break so we're just gonna say one big wave goodbye please enjoy your summer breaks and when you're bored and you want some some creativity make sure to take a code break goodbye everybody guys goodbye so you
