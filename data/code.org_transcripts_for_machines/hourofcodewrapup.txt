(Bobak NASA Engineer) Hey guys, We're here at NASA's jet propulsion lab in the room where we control the Curiosity rover, which is on Mars right now exploring the planet. The rover navigates Mars using a computer program that works a lot like the last puzzle you just solved. The last bit of code you created, lays out instructions that can tell any robot how to find its way through a nonbranching maze or tunnel of any complexity or length. It could be a zombie, a bird, a selfdriving car or even a Mars rover. The code you wrote can get it where it needs to go. (Tess Google Engineer) You may not think that you learned a lot in your first hour of code. But actually, these basic concepts you just learned are at the heart of every program or app that you'll ever create. So we've learned about Repeat loops, RepeatUntil statements IF statements, the IFELSE block But hey! Guess What? Don't stop here. There's tons of other stuff to learn! Visit Code.org and continue your education into coding. Once you complete our full 20 hour curriculum you'll have mastered the basics of programming and can start learning how to write phone apps, games or robot instructions. Or really, anything, you name it. Technology is changing everything we do and it doesn't matter if you're young or old, programming is fun. And guess what? Anyone Can Do It.
