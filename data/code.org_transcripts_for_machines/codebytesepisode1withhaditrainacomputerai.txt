b here we are yeah all right sophia already i think we're live really yeah okay hi everybody this is hadi partovi i'm the creator of the hour of code and the ceo of code.org and i'm here with my daughter sophia hi sophia and this is our first episode of code bytes uh you know this week is the computer science education week and collectively we're celebrating the hour of code which is you know this global celebration of computer science uh today and every day of this week millions of students all around the world are going to be coding and what's exciting wait let me turn off my background this is weird hold on a second i'm going to turn off my zoom background so um every day of this week millions of students around the world are going to be doing the hour of code and this is an idea the hour of code is something that i came up with just eight years ago and it's been incredible that over the past eight years one billion times an hour of code has been done uh now today we're not going to be together for an entire hour this is going to be fast we're calling this code bytes uh because it's little bitesized lessons so we're going to be together for about maybe 20 25 minutes i know lots of students have school days whether you're in school or whether you're doing remote learning we want to support students doing an hour of code and you're part of something much much larger than the hundreds of students that are online right now uh you know because there's going to be literally millions of people around the world coding today uh sophia are you ready sure all right so first we're gonna today we're gonna learn about artificial intelligence or a.i sophia do you know what artificial intelligence is yeah um okay i always say get the um definition mixed up but um it's a computer or like a technology that um doesn't need to be explicitly programmed to do something yeah that's really advanced we've explained it ai is generally just when a computer does something that seems really smart like it's got it seems to have human intelligence and it's a way of programming computers to learn um but before we talk about this i want to find out where all of our students are from we had a qr code at the beginning for people to show where they are on the map but instead of using that i'm going to ask everybody to use the chat so if you click on the little chat button at the bottom of your screen if you're in the chat uh choose a little drop down that looks like this that says to all panelists and attendees that way you'll be able to types and everybody can see what you type and if you could just type in the location you're calling in from so we can see where everybody's calling from i hope this works maybe you need to enable the chat the chat might be i'm not enabled for people uhoh also a serious problem here where's my bug we don't don't worry about that all right it does look like the chat is enabled but let's go on to learning about ai so what we're going to do is we're going to teach a computer how to recognize stuff but let me first start by saying um if if uh to do this together with sophia sophia i'm going to show you a face and you tell me if i'm angry or i'm sad okay ready set go i think that's angry how about this that's happy at least it should be okay so you can recognize my face easily now but what's what a i can try to do is recognize that same thing but what happens if you don't see the entire face now what am i that's still angry how about this happy i think maybe surprised i i don't know that's not really scared but i'm sad how about if i show you this way so i'm showing you that because ai can sometimes recognize things like humans and sometimes it can do even better because it sees more than the than just a part of the picture so we're going to go use a tutorial where we can teach an ai something so give me just one second i'm going to share my screen sharing screen so where we are is that the code.org ai for oceans tutorial and what you can see is uh this ai for oceans where you can program something to program the ai if you go into it we're going to program ai to recognize fish and to distinguish what is fish and what is not fish so to help clean the oceans so sophia the more we program this the better ai learns so tell me is this a fish no are you sure i think so all right it's not a fish how about that no nothing she just rotated how about this one that's a fish this one's a fish how about this yes this is a fish that's a fish yes to fish i think that's a fish of course it's a fish what about that kind of looks like a fish when you first see it i know it's not not a fish and look over here is showing how many times we've trained ai so how about this that's a fish how about this that's a fish that's not a fish not a fish yes a fish no definitely not a fish not a fish it should know this one by now but so now we've given ai 13 different things to go from do you think that's enough for it to learn i don't think so well let's continue and see what happens so now ai's gonna get to decide on its own based on the training we gave it we gave it 13 examples let's see how how well it learned i don't think it's gonna work see what dad you couldn't put a gasoline in the ocean so we can go quickly so okay it is doing a really really bad job let's see and if i finish continuing to see all the things that it's trained so this shows what it put in the ocean it said all of these classified these as fish yeah and if we see what it says was not fish okay it did pretty well at recognizing the not fish it didn't put any fish into the trash well so now if we want we can click to train more to get it a little bit smarter so help me a little bit out with this is this fish yes fish fish you can also do this the way where you try to get all the garbage into the ocean for fun but in real life you probably should that's not fun that is not fun so i'm gonna do this fast because i know what's fishing that's fish that's fish that's fish that's fish that's fish all right now let's see if it does much better we gave it 28 examples so tell me is the computer doing well wait but when i did this i gave it like 130 examples just to be safe there's a tire in there did it still make a mistake ah it's still making mistakes so what we realized is to get ai to get actually smart to do recognition you need to give it a lot more training than what we did so even though we gave it 28 examples that was still not enough to recognize fish from trash so you can see it still is putting all sorts of garbage in the ocean wait but we see the locker you want to see the not garbage right you get a fish in there dad you created them you did better when before with less training it did better yeah oh that's terrible you're you're taking out the fish now right so one of the things we i want to show is how ai can actually be used to train a computer something that it didn't know and by the way check it out the the chat has now been turned on so now people can type everywhere that they're from so they're calling from india from arizona from lebanon maharashtra indiana texas canada michigan new york it's going super fast only like see colorado massachusetts georgia miami toronto it is going way too fast to see all this that's pretty awesome all right so one of the things i want to show is we just showed how to recognize fish from not fish but we can teach ai to do other things as well so let's teach the ai how to recognize a word that it never learned before all right so let me share the screen again one second all right so now we want to teach the ai a new word so everybody who's there chatting can you all instead of chatting where you're from look at these words on screen and tell me what word should we teach ai we want to teach it to recognize a type of fish it could be a delicious fish it could be a happy fish it could be a playful fish people are saying scary fun silly personal favorite is delicious all right let's choose from the ones that people have chosen scary is coming up a lot so i'm going to choose scary we're going to teach what's a scary fish all right so is that scary that fish just looks quite funny all right this one's not scary right no but the next one is this one is definitely scary look at those angry eyes spooky how about this one no not scary how about this one not scary not scary this one's got funny teeth but scary but but it's really kind eyes what do you say for this one yeah not scary definitely not not scary right this fish looks kind of scary right now definitely the next one does and this one is definitely scary this one's not so scary so sophia can you go through this really quickly and do like 50 of them or even more that one's kind of yeah go quickly without talking about it so as sophia's training this there's a couple of things to think about one is what are the features of the fist she's looking at to decide what is or isn't scary is she looking at the eyes is she looking at the mouth there's another question which is is it even fair to decide whether fish is scary or not based on its looks now maybe for an animal that might be fair but when ai is being trained when we train machine machines to do things based on what they see there's a really important question are we teaching them to be fair or not fair and in fact did you know that scientists in in europe are already training ai to recognize from human faces whether somebody looks trustworthy or not that's a terrible way to use ai to suggest that a computer can detect whether or not they can trust you based on the look of your face that's just not fair at all so it's really important when people train ai why is this fish where's the mouth of the fish it's got a really big separated from the fish's body all right that's scary so my point from what i was saying is just because you can train a computer to do something it doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing to do that so training to recognize whether a fish is scary or not that may just sound kind of fun but doing that with human faces and trying to decide if somebody is trustworthy based on their look is not okay so we've done this 59 times now let's see did ai learn what sofia believes is scary yeah this is my opinion yeah it's important to know that we just taught it sophia's biased opinion of what is or isn't scary somebody else might choose something different so somebody might have thought those sharp teeth were scary so let's go through this really fast and get a whole bunch of fish that one with a smile was not scary did you see it okay all right so i'm continuing on these are all the scary things okay that squiggly one at the very bottom this one yeah that's kind of funny but one of these was just not scary at all let's see like we can look in fact if you click on one if you click on this one you can click on the i and find out why did it think it was scary because it had scary eyes right there how come this one was scary its eyes weren't scary but it thought its body and its tail and its mouth were scary that's yeah yeah this one its eyes weren't scary but because it had a dorsal fin and a scary looking tail and i think we've labeled enough of the sshaped fish this snake scary that i just thought all the snakes are scary because it has a scary looking body so you can tell why ai thinks different things are scary like this has scary eyes or this has this one it's because of its eyes but also its mouth so ai doesn't know what is or isn't scary it is learning from what you tell it and you gave it only 58 examples and that's what it's going from so obviously when you train a real computer to do stuff using ai it needs a lot more information than that but since we have only 20 minutes to go or 20 minutes total we have about less than about 10 minutes to go we don't have enough time to train it with enough data now i want to train something more complicated to show ai which is american sign language does anybody know what sign language is what is sign language used for it's um a language used for people that can't people that are deaf people who can't hear or people who can't speak if somebody can't speak they also need to use signs and also if they can't hear they need to use signs as well so i want to teach a computer to recognize a very short word using sign language so if you google sign language this is the american sign language but i want to teach it to recognize code so we're going to make a code spelling so can you spell this out how do you spell a c that's a c and then do an o o and then do a d it's a d and then an e that's an e great so now we want to take a computer to recognize those letters from each other we're going to go into something called teachable machine you can just google teachable machine to find it and we're going to make an image project which is going to recognize different images and we're going to make it recognize a bunch of things the letter c we're going to differentiate that from the letter o and then the letter d and then lastly the letter e we want to teach it all of these letters so we're going to use our webcam to train it what okay okay sophia we're using one camera to show us up here and a different camera that's now being trained over here so you show the letter c make it a good one and i'm going to click hold to record and now move it around a little bit keep doing it okay we gave it 18 images of c that's enough no that's okay it'll make mistakes i'm gonna keep changing these cameras here do you want okay now show the letter o make it really different than the c ready i'm going to record it bring it bring your hand closer a little bit move it around okay we have 20 images of o's now we're going to do a letter d this shouldn't quite recognize it my finger ready okay all right and then lastly the letter e each time we're doing this we're giving the computer example images make sure this doesn't look like an o i don't think it does at least i don't think it does either but the computer might get confused so now that we did that we're going to train the model we've given it 23 images of these 20 20 that has about 80 different images to look at as its training which that adds up to a lot more than the you know 15 fish that we showed it but that's not a lot of images so the question is is that going to be enough for the computer to learn how to do this or not training an ai the more images you get it the better it's going to get and in fact when computer scientists use this when when people talk about cars that learn to drive themselves they're training the ai to recognize street signs what is a pedestrian what is a road have you ever been on a website where the website asks you which of these things are traffic lights or which of these things or something else yeah you're actually when you're doing that you're training an ai to to do this uh to recognize street things from each other so now let's see our ai has already been trained and let me change the webcam and it's already yelling okay all right so now show it the letter c and look over here it says with 70 likelihood it knows this way it knows that that's a c now show an o and no it definitely got that you have an o now show letter d it's having trouble with that one bring it down a little bit or move it oh it got it yeah it knows that that's a d and i'll show the e it's struggling with this one if you move it a little bit so basically as you're recognizing down here the computer can tell what you're doing and now i want to show something else we can do this with this you can export this model and we just train the ai and we can upload what we trained to the internet what yeah you haven't seen this before and now we have a url this right here is a web page that can recognize what we just did or we can even take this and put it in code so i over here have code that i've written to make our own web page if i hit play and we can edit the code to do whatever we want with it wait for the camera to start wait for it ready come on all right maybe it's not going to go well let's try this other way that's actually quite funny okay so if i take this model that we copied i can open it in a new new url and look here's a web page that's a brand new web page that you can basically turn on maybe it's having trouble because of my other camera being on well when it does work oh here it is so here's this camera that finally turned on it's very glitchy though it's glitchy can you show it the letter o it got it try the letter put the letter d it's having trouble my finger is right there there i got it i'll put the letter e it's confusing the d and the e because i'm not seeing your finger but now let's see if how it does with my hand it got the letter c you got the letter it doesn't get the letter okay okay if it doesn't work very well for my hand because we only trained it on your hand sideway so what we just saw there is we just trained the ai how to recognize the sign language those four letters using your hand but we didn't train it using my hand and so the computer can only see when you're showing signs not what i'm doing and this shows another part of what it means to train an ai and how to avoid training bias because if you train an ai to learn and recognize only one type of thing from one type of person and not a broad representation of people you don't get as good a sense of how it works or you know it might not work fairly or equally for some people this happens very much in today's day you know as people are training computers to recognize diseases imagine if it recognizes a disease better among women than among men or better among people with white skin than people with dark skin and it's really important this is actually happening in today's world computers need to be trained with a broad representation of images so that they get get the answer right in a way that is fair for everybody that's looking at it all right so we are now getting at the end of our lesson we promised that these would be short uh thank you for joining us for computer science education week if you want to try using ai for oceans yourself to train a computer to recognize a fish from trash or teach your own world go to code.org at home all of our lessons that students can learn at home are listed over there and look for ai for oceans or if you want to use teachable machine like we did you could just google teachable machine and go to that website and you can teach nai to recognize a smile from an angry face you can teach it to recognize sign language or you can teach your computer to play rock paper scissors by teaching it a rock and a paper and scissors that all of those are possible using that teachable machine tool that we showed so go try on your own to see what you can teach ai to do and learn more about how computers do computer vision and by the way if you're enjoying learning about ai just this week we launched something new which i want to show you if you go to code.org ai and i'm going to share my screen one last time to show this where's my screen here it is so we have if you go to code.org ai this is an entire page about artificial intelligence and you can see the ai for oceans that we did there's also this new video series how ai works which talks about what is machine learning what is training data and bias what are neural networks how does computer vision work and two different videos about ethics and ai which are really important the questions of equal access algorithmic bias data privacy and the future of work when computers are starting to automate jobs using artificial intelligence that video series is at code.org ai and it's something you can watch yourselves and families can watch it together with parents or with uh with their children or even with your grandparents uh thank you everybody for joining us have a wonderful computer science education week and we'll see you we're going to be doing this every day this week so we'll see you tomorrow say bye bye yay so so you
