from the Nasdaq market site in Times Square I'm Brad Smith and you're watching behind the Bell now as you may have seen on some of the broadcast networks or perhaps even here on Facebook live code.org rang the opening bell to celebrate hour of code which is officially kicked off and now we're joined by their chief executive officer how do you part Toby to discuss a lot of the great initiatives that are going on around this I did great to have you here thank you so much it was such an exciting morning yeah yeah so we saw you on the broadcast networks here on Facebook live how was it ringing the opening bell it was such an amazing experience you know I've always seen you know what companies I've invested and I've gone public watching them you know bring the opening bell but the excitement was just palpable it's awesome absolutely now hour of code and code or you're no stranger to the Nasdaq market side as well especially last year when you brought r2d2 who is a very well known figure obviously for any of us so what does co.org an hour of code have in store for this year and and perhaps even before that take us back had an hour of code get it start so you know code.org had the original vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science but you know the challenge with computer science is you don't need to explain to people that technology's changing the world or that there's money in it everybody already knows that you could go anywhere in the country people understand that but people don't realize that I could learn to make an app or my eightyearold daughter could learn to code or my classroom of kids in New York City can all start learning computer science people just don't imagine that and the idea behind the hour of code is to ask every student in every classroom in the entire world to try just one hour to demystify this field to realize that you can learn this and then once you do the first hour you go well beyond to then decide okay I can actually do this now there's another side of the conversation that would argue shouldn't we let children choose their own passions instead of pushing this on them but but what would you have to say to that I completely agree the data when you actually survey students if you ask them what is what are the classes that they like the most number one is art number two is dance number three is computer science well you would not believe that so yes we should let you students study what they want but the way to do that is to offer computer science in the schools the problem we try to solve is that most schools don't even teach computer science so they're kids who would like to learn it don't have a chance and then the other thing is if they don't ever get a taste of it they won't even know if they like it and an hour of code is enough to give you that taste to give you get you hooked so what what exactly can we learn in just one hour then the the most important thing you learn in one hour is that this is more fun than you thought and easier than you thought and that you'd like to learn more that's that's the most important thing but in terms of actual technical concept so you can learn the idea of a repeat loop that you can have a bunch of commands in and then say I want this to repeat a thousand times and how quickly you can do a computer can do a lot more than one thing at a time you know that's a simple type of a technical concept that you can learn easily with an hour of code absolutely now before we started we were actually discussing you know exactly what kind of systems they're using to learn how to code and and they you know giving my own personal example you know the reason why I got my first job was because I had made my own website and I had kind of dropped in different pieces of open source code and information to be able to really make it my own and customize it and that in that sense so how exactly are kids learning this day these days or is it through you know a WYSIWYG or you know what's what's this bar for younger kids the most popular way of learning is with block based coding okay and in fact the code.org tutorial system our our website actually has a full coding environment Wow that is by far the most popular learning environment for computer science right now it's literally used by a hundred million students globally one out of ten students in the entire planet has used code org to learn basic block based coding now can America's public schools teach coding as well how do we roll that out that's a great question because when I started three years ago people just said no they said don't even bother trying to get public schools to teach this they always said do an after school thing or a summer thing and I just thought that just is gonna leave half the country or more than half the country behind you know we have a trillion dollar system called the American public school system every kid goes through it that school system can change and the last three years we've got a hundred of the largest districts in the country as well as many states that say we're going to teach us in public schools so New York City Oakland Chicago Los Angeles all of these cities have said every school must teach computer science and that's completely just gonna change the nature of who gets into tech so now thinking in the broader education system as well you know President Obama was obviously a huge supporter for advancing technology and computer science education within the K through 12 academic curriculum so with the new administration coming in what what I'm interested in knowing is how do we think that'll shake things up or perhaps move it forward hopefully so I actually think what we're doing is more important now than ever before what we learned in this election is that Americans demand opportunity whether you're an urban you know kid living in a neighborhood in New York City or Chicago or whether you're part of the working class in a rural region Americans just feel like the system isn't repaying hard work and now I don't think manufacturing jobs are gonna be coming back quite the way we'd like not because they're gonna stay in China but because they're gonna get automated we're living in a world where computers are gonna automate manufacturing jobs they're gonna automate truck driving jobs and I think even works of work in medicine is gonna be increasingly automated there's already computers that can detect cancer better than a doctor can so as a lot of the work that we do gets automated where's the growth in the economy it's in computing and computer science right now the currently open jobs in computing fields are the largest slice of new wages in the country so we already have the jobs we just need to train people to go into them so getting back to the new administration this is the best way for the new administration to help fix the economy and and Donald Trump's hundredday plan has already mentioned technology education and he's got like a twosentence is about education but technology is part of that so I think I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of support that certainly and even more over with the sectors that it impacts one that we don't think about all the time agriculture and you see companies like blue apron that are rolling out and using technology to better facilitate how they're tracking things in their warehouse is to actually facilitating a service where they're making sure the food is getting fresh from farmtotable and losers are able to do that yeah we hear about selfdriving cars or selfdriving trucks already right now and Fields John Deere has selfdriving tractors Wow you know selfdriving tractors are much there's nothing you can bump into you're not gonna run into humans or you know there's not it's on a freeway so it's on a giant field but these aren't sort of just an idea in the lab they're actually out in the field today which means the farmers that are managing those selfdriving tractors are actually coding on a tablet what the tractors supposed to do and they're actually giving it commands a lot like the block based coding that we do with kids had and that's gonna change agriculture there's not a single field there's not a single career not a single area of academic study that's not getting disrupted by computing computer science certainly so if I'm a parent how do I become an advocate for this and make sure that I can get involved the most important thing any parent can do is go to your school your kids school and say please teach computer science and coding that's the most important thing you might think I want to find a summer camp for them or an after school thing like real school should be teaching this and of course then if the school doesn't you can try to find an after school activity and if you go to code org we both have online courses we also have a whole map where you can find workshops or summer camps but to advocate for your school to teach computer science that's the most important thing now horse who are some of the figures that have gotten involved this year because we were talking about some of them before and it's quite amazing so could you share with the Facebook audience sure you know we've always had the good fortune of having you know amazing people support what we're doing cuz it's such a good idea so you know we started off with Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and Jack Dorsey saying this is important then President Obama joined it and said and then that not just the president Republicans Democrats celebrities this year our theme has been athletes so we've had Serena Williams Kobe Bryant Neymar Marcelo and Sergio Ramos from Spain draymond Green Carmelo Anthony Sue Bird Alana beard a whole cast of characters from the NBA it's been amazing having these athletes do this and if you actually look at their Facebook pages Neymar actually just posted this video we put out of all these athletes together encouraging kids to be all that they can be in to push themselves to learn computer science and just before we wrap the the brandy fills here at Nasdaq is that of ambition coupled with tagline a nitro ambition what piece of advice would you have for the next generation of perhaps ambitious coders out there well you know our vision aligns really well with the Nasdaq vision because if you have this ambitious vision of something you want to do the best way to do something big is with coding there's no other field where you could start a company from your bedroom and then suddenly see it expand all around the world that's literally what I've done with the hour of code it started out as a simple idea and it's now worldwide but I would say learn computer science and then stick with it absolutely I did great to have you here after the Nasdaq opening bell and look forward to having hour of code in co.org back many more times in a few thank you so much absolutely and thank you all for watching live on Facebook stay tuned for more coming from the Nasdaq market site throughout the rest of the day
