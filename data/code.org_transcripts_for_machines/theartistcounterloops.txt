(Trina Roy Pixar Engineer) I got my start in software working on Shrek actually a long, long time ago. You're taking these basic building blocks loops, and counters, and algorithms. You use that stuff every single day and you gradually build them all up and it just turns into this tool that an artist can take and just run with it and just do really amazing things with it. Hey there, so you did your squares good job. We're gonna make it a little bit easier this time. We're going to do the same squares only we're going to use something called a counter loop. A counter loops is just like a regular loop, but every time you loop around you add a little bit of a number. So, you see your counter loop right here, it came from the loop section. Then you've got your draw square function that you've been using all along. So now, you just go into the variables section you pull out that counter block, you stick it into the length bit. So now what you've got is something that says, count with counter from 50 to 90 using 10 draw a square. So what that's going to do is it will first draw a square with sides of 50, then it will add 10 to the counter, draw it again, then as it loops around it adds 10 each time. So you get squares of 50 ,60, 70, 80, 90. So your zombie is going to be a master artist. Good job!
