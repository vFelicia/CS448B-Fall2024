Guiding students through the problem solving process is me reminding them of the process over and over, especially in new situations. Often times students say, "I don't know where to start" or "I don't know what this means". Having that problemsolving process reiterated throughout helps them to at least say, "Okay, what *do* i know?" and "What is this asking me?" and it helps them flesh that out a little bit more. When I go over the problemsolving process with my students, I let them know that sometimes you can go forward in the process, sometimes you can go in reverse in the process, and sometimes you can skip different steps. as long as you're using the problem solving process to help you figure out what the issue is. I might not know something, and i'm going to reach out to my network to find out the answer. The problem solving process is teaching students how to do that, and we automatically assume that students are going to know how to help themselves, and it's a learned skill. It's not taught into school. So the ability to teach those problem solving processes is teaching kids how to learn, and how to advocate for themselves, and they're not getting that in any other course.
