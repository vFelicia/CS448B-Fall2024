hello everybody thanks for joining us for today's my journey class chat um i'm brian i'm part of the product team here at code.org and i'm super excited to welcome kevin shriver today who's going to tell us all about his journey from teaching himself how to how to build websites to becoming a graphic designer and to his current role of running an entire team that helps to make online healthcare experiences at greenway health better for all the teachers here we've enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats going forward so please take advantage of that and also to the teachers please let us know where you're tuning in from and put your students questions for kevin in the q a we will try our best to get to some of those during the chat today um so just kick us off we're going to start with a fun icebreaker kevin um actually first of all kevin want to introduce yourself just a little bit and tell us what your favorite thing to do at recess was when you were in elementary school okay hi i'm kevin trevor 32 married get a kid um and yeah but i've been in this general field of software design and and uh development for about a decade now um and we get into in a little bit further later but my favorite thing to do at recess was foursquare uh yeah i had a core group of friends i would run out with immediately and all to stand in line and try to you know like get other people off the court and come with those strategies and all that fun stuff but foursquare is what i did i remember four square we even had a variant called four square kickball where you would like have it the square and the pitcher would roll the ball toward you and you'd whack it with your foot and so the ball went a lot further there and that was very competitive we were very cutthroat about that yeah awesome well kevin tell us a little bit more about what you do um what is your job title and what exactly do you do so right my job title is user interface uh development manager well uh so essentially i'm in charge of making all the screens or all the components and elements that would be inside of software um just the visual side of it and how they how they look and how they how they feel all their little animations all those little intricacies um i build those and help other developers put them into their projects yeah okay so let's break that title down a little bit so a user interface what what does that mean the user interface is anything that you interact with on the computer everything you know is is stored in the computer but you have to interact with it somehow and how you interact with this by clicking on icons or you know you know touching on stuff with the on the screen so the user interface is everything that you're interacting with i see go ahead yeah sorry and who is the user in this case for you for me the user uh is doctors and nurses and people inside of um doctor facilities hospitals uh and and other developers inside of my company also or part of my user base specifically but okay yeah yeah and then the other part of your title is development manager so what what does that mean in your daytoday life right so our company just creates software um for hospitals and doctors uh so development is all of that right our entire company has a lot of developers software engineers people that make these these applications day in and day out and so i um i manage a small team that is in charge of developing a certain part of all of all that software yeah can you give us a quick screenshot of or like just share your screen of what doctors might see when they're using um greenway health's product sure so this is a uh unfinished kind of uh screen our application that's currently being developed so this is what a doctor would look at whenever they're looking at their their patient list for the day or even uh you know just their patient list in general they would come down here and see the patient name be able to see a photo if they wanted to is where all of your information whenever you go to the doctor um your stuff would show up here so the doctor's looking at their schedule for the day they're trying to figure out who they need to look at and you know what they what they're doing with their day they would come here and kind of look through a list like this to see who their next appointment is and and there's a plenty of other little things going on here but for the most part you know this is the only interesting bit yeah so if i go to the doctor's office this is kind of what the doctors and the nurses are using to make sure that all my information is up to date is that right exactly right like this will either be on a tablet or on the computer that they're clicking at so anytime they're you're in a doctor's office and they're you know playing with a tablet or computer uh they're using the software like this okay to capture all the data about you and to you know do all their doctoring stuff about with you all the doctoring stuff yeah yeah um yeah that's that's seems much faster than using pen and paper which i remember when i was a kid going in and doctors writing things down by hand yeah i remember that too and then you'd see it sometimes and it'll just be you can't read it because doctor january is not great aimlessly bad handwriting and you know the system like this is important because it lets kind of your information your medical information get shared amongst various like hospitals providers and that sort of thing right exactly all this stuff is is stored in a cloud or a server of some sort okay yeah anyone can access it for the most part anywhere yeah so if i go to a different doctor they can also see the same information so i can get good care wherever i go yeah oh that's really cool so we do hear a lot about doctors and nurses in healthcare that are kind of the face of healthcare that we see and when we go into the hospital or the doctor's office but it seems like there are a lot of other jobs that make quality health care possible um so tell us a little bit about your work journey how did you end up here like where did you start and how did you end up here this is where i should share some of my yeah go ahead right so i started out uh going to college uh for digital arts and design now i'll screen share again here so we can see um so i was a graphic designer way back in the day and this is some of the stuff that i made whenever can you see my screen yes i can see it right so like after i was done with college for the most part this is where i'll go out to businesses and be like hey hire me as a graphic designer and uh i mean like this is just kind of a magazine advertisement um a logo redesigned for the city of osaka oh cool yeah and uh this is just kind of an online advertisement of some sort oh that looks really cool did you is this by did you draw this out by hand i did everything on the computer i was very much so i wasn't very good at drawing myself okay you know pen and paper so everything was very digital for me oh that's super cool at least in my process it was very digital and it's kind of like uh a band advertisement okay and this is uh like a bus stop yeah it's just kind of way to show what it would look like out there in the water yeah it didn't actually get printed it's not actually out of bus stop anywhere so i can't go out and find it endless ambition the band i don't even know that's a real band who might be uh then some more magazine kind of spreads very into to print to print design yeah so yeah i've made a lot of different just kind of magazines in my time there um really skateboards and snowboarding so that was obviously a big thing you know for two of my magazines just kind of like arch and then skateboarding and snowboarding and that was all i was into in college yeah this is a skate deck that i i did draw right so i wasn't very good at hand drawing but i could do doodles pretty well neat so this is a yeah this is for a skateboard deck yep yep so it's kind of combining your uh the art and the boarding together into one right unfortunately this also did not get printed onto a real skateboard hey there's still possible right yeah it's still possible i could i could dig this up and do it this is really cool so how did you go from um coming up with like art and graphic design into what you do now it's really kind of a slow process uh my first job out of college was with a user experience team where i was a graphic designer and i don't know if you remember um the blockbuster like video rentals or you use redbox right yeah blockbuster i remember that i do the same thing and so i worked for the company that uh that owned all of those and so i would actually put all the graphics and created all the graphics for the blockbuster express kiosks that was my first job out of college wow that's such a throwback i know right yeah nobody rents videos anymore it's all it's online online now or what what is video random i haven't rented a video in quite some time right you just go to amazon or netflix or hulu and watch whatever yeah yeah um so yeah that was my first job and then um i got another job from that as a lead designer of a softball company a small softball company softball cool yeah they made me sleep uh like bats and face masks and helmet and helmets and everything so i was just kind of in charge of creating their general look and feel and their website and creating their website was part of how i started evolving into this whole thing into being a developer i was really handson with the people that were developing the new website as i was as i was designing it and i learned quite a bit and i was kind of interested in it and so the job i took after that was with the with aaa you know the people you call whenever you're on the on the side of the road oh yeah and that was as a webmaster so it was much more a developmentfocused job and so i just started sliding fully down in that and i haven't really designed anything for quite some time yeah so it sounds like you didn't necessarily code a lot as a kid but you kind of found your way to coding through design and through working with companies that needed work done on on their design right yeah when i was a kid coding wasn't a very big thing uh you know i was early 90s when i was growing up i was born in the 80s so coding wasn't exactly accessible or you know i didn't even have a computer or access to the internet until i was a little bit older um so coding wasn't really anything on the mind um until yeah it just kind of worked out right you never know where you're gonna end up you have to try new things yeah absolutely that's just kind of how it works you know yeah i know that's super cool to hear um because i also didn't start coding until a little later and so there's always tons of different paths to see how computer science may end up in our lives um just as a reminder to our participants here uh be sure to share your questions in the q a um for kevin um yeah so kevin what do you feel is awesome about your job what's really great about my job is is working with the healthcare industry and you know allowing people to get access to healthcare a little bit easier and to allow doctors to do their to do um what they need to do to help the community and to help uh just everyone that goes to the doctor you know they they have enough on their plate the doctors do so i i we want to make all the paperwork that they do as as smooth and seamless as possible um and the other great parts about my job is this is my office i just i i stumble out of bed and come over here in the mornings and uh this is where i remain for the day is just kind of in my office here so i get to spend a lot of time with my my my wife and my daughter and um i really can't ask for too much more than that drive and i get to just you know stay in here so this is you're working from home right now is that right yes yep yeah show us your office i want to see oh geez so yeah it's it's it's messy in here so we got the office um good stuff on the wall cool art in the walls very nice closets more stuff on the walls oh lots of art yeah lots of stuff on the walls and the floor is covered with laundry because i'm not doing laundry you know i think that's the reality for a lot of us laundry on the floor yeah you have organized piles yeah you know when you don't have a parent there to like tell you to pick up your laundry it just stays on the floor it's convenient you know it's convenient until you're digging through a pile and then you're like oh this is why you fold clothes this is why you fold them and put them away so you know where they're at whenever you need them yeah yeah i'm also seeing i think i see some like board games there on the on the back shelf is that right yeah i've got a collection of of kid board games and then board games for for adult friends and stuff like uh scrabble and clue and oh clue classic nice and the kid board games are for playing with your daughter is that right yeah she's not old enough yet we just have those until she's she's only eight months old right now so she's oh she wouldn't know what to do with any yeah yeah different type of game that she's into right now yeah what do you do what do you like to do outside of work i thought of working like just kind of go on going walks and hikes and stuff right i live in florida so there's a lot there's a decent amount of just hiking trails around here and seeing the uh the swampy wildlife the alligators and stuff yeah watch out for those right yeah you gotta watch out uh just if you see one you just kind of just backtrack go the other way don't don't get near those um but yeah just try to spend as much time outside as i can since i spend all my time in in this office yeah and i think you mentioned you also like to play games right uh video games yeah i do yeah right next to my work set up here i've got two monitors then over here i've got my my home pc that i built uh myself oh wow um yeah i i would show off you know all the cool leds inside of it and all the fans and stuff but i can't get my oh yeah my camera down there is it ever a distraction to have your gaming set up right next to your work setup it can be um it can be that's why it stays off for most of the day until you know designated times yeah yeah it can be you know especially when we first started um whenever you first started working from home and like oh man i could just play video games all day but no i'm like you can't you gotta yeah do your work you gotta actually help doctors and nurses get there yeah so along the way along your cs journey like were there people who helped you like who who was that and how i mean plenty of people that have helped me throughout the years uh a couple of mentors specifically at uh at triplea and the job i had afterwards um there's people that just like knew a lot and i just asked them a lot of questions really that's all getting a mentor is is just finding someone that'll answer all the questions that you have and so i just found those people and i bugged them relentlessly with questions until i i knew you know a portion of what they knew about just trying to get as much information from them as possible and they were you know um the reason why they're good people or good mentors like that's because they entertained it um so really yeah it's just really anyone that you can ask a lot of questions about i'll ask a lot of questions too is uh someone that can help you along the way and that's that's who i found just people that answer questions yeah yeah and kind of in the same vein what advice would you give to students out there listening who might be just starting to learn about computer science um it's difficult but it's you can do it you know like it's for sure anyone can can learn it there's a million different ways you can contribute to computer science and to software development or any of the number of things that can be done on a computer there's any personality any way like you learn you can you can learn different ways and methods and you can you can just do it uh so you just gotta try right where persistence is really the only thing you need in this world so you know if you run into a roadblock you gotta either work through it or go around it and try a different avenue um but really just just give it a shot you know if you're interested at all then just just you just gotta do it yeah you mentioned asking lots of questions do you recommend that for students learning computer science as well i mean recommended for everyone but yeah with computer science right like even um the job i had before this the my boss was he's been doing this for like 20 years his dad was also an engineer and he knew everything but he was constantly reading things constantly learning so that's why he knew everything because he was always trying to seek new information try to trying to you know learn something new or if he saw something he didn't understand he'd immediately dive into the documentation and try to find some some answer as to why he didn't understand it and to figure it out um so yeah it's just yeah yeah ask lots of questions and seek you know answers to your questions really either by asking people or reading about it or you know just learning in general yeah yeah and you know what would you say to you know a student who may not necessarily see themselves doing computer science maybe they're like into design and graphics like you were when you were younger and maybe they just don't know how they could use computer science in their life what would you say to them i mean i mean computer science yeah it's very allencompassing right my degree is in digital arts and design um so even people that develop software all day need to have someone that makes stuff look good so you know there's there's huge teams these companies i've worked at things like 80 90 people who don't do don't code they they do design and they they make things look good and they they do all sorts of stuff technical writing uh people that write things you know all day also are needed in software teams so it's anything really software's so allencompassing these days yeah it's wrong you can really do any job inside of it seems like a huge team effort yes yeah well thank you so much kevin and thank you all to the teachers and students who attended today this is our last my journey class chat for the spring and so we want to thank all of the teachers out there who have tuned in and brought these experiences to their classrooms and to their students you can find recordings of all of our past chats from the fall and the spring at code.org cs journeys so please check those out and then one last thing teachers please check your email for a survey we really appreciate your feedback thank you so much kevin for joining us today really awesome to hear about how you got into computer science and where you started what you're doing today to help contribute to your community yeah thank you brian thanks for having me thanks so much thanks everybody have a great one bye
