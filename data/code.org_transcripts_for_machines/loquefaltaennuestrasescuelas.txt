I learned how to code 20 years ago when I was really little. I learned how to code 37 years ago when I was 9 years old. I was in the 6th grade. I wrote a program to play tictactoe. I was 6 years old and used to go to cybercafes. Technology is changing the world. Computers are on our desks, in our pockets they're everywhere. Programming is giving a set of simple instructions to a computer. It might seem difficult, but anyone can learn. I think that technology is magic. All schools need to teach the skills of the future. We have the possibility to create opportunities for our children in Argentina, In Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic! For all children around the world. The champions of the future will be the creators, those with the talent to make their dreams real. We can't always know what the future will be like. To prepare for the future, we have to change the curriculum. And this is a superpower! If you know how to code, you know how to create the future. If you're a man or a woman, rich or poor, whether you're at home or in school. Don't just play on your phone. Program it. I wish that the whole world would learn to be able to create a better world. The possibilities are endless What will you create?
