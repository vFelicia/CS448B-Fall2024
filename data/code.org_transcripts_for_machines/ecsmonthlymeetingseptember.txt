hello everyone and welcome to our very first google + hangout on air for the 20152016 school year my name is melissa jones and i'm going to be one of your host for this evening we're going to get started in just a minute or two in the meantime we're going to be using the hashtag code or PVE on twitter so if you have any comments feedback or would like to join the conversation please tweet with us there just give us one minute to get started you okay I think we should be in good shape here everyone should have a link to the event page on Google+ which is a good place to go ahead and put questions if you have any or tweet them to code org PD Brooke is going to pull up some slides here and if you'd like to make Brooks slides which I'm going to go over the biggest part of your screen go ahead and click on the slide down below me there and they should come up and stay up for you so Brooke let's go ahead and go to the next slide so as I said welcome this is our exploring computer science monthly meeting this is our first meeting of the year we're really excited to have you with us my name is Melissa Joan of a community manager here at code.org and I'll let Brooke and Danni introduce themselves as well hi I'm Danny McEvoy I and the ecs program manager code org I also help out with other areas of high school curriculum and professional development and I am Brooke Osborn I am a high school program manager at code.org I focus on professional development and curriculum across all of our high school projects and in just a few minutes we're going to hear from a very special gas flow Vaughn who you'll see here on the screen as well and I'll let her introduce herself when we get to her segment let's go to the next five Brooke alright so really quickly some tips for using google hangouts on air you can see and hear us but we can't see or hear you so don't worry about it if you're in your pjs or if you're enjoying your evening adult beverage it's all good we don't have any idea what's going on on your end that you do on our end and as I mentioned before you can control what's in the biggest section of your screen by clicking so if you click on my face I'll come up in the biggest section if you click on the slides they'll come up in the biggest section that way you can tailor your view we are going to be interacting throughout this hangout so if you're joining us live please go to Twitter and use the hashtag code or PV to join the conversation that's where you're going to want to put any questions you have comments feedback or just say hello to the other folks who are online we're also going to be using the google plus page as the place to share your your questions for the speakers so make sure you go there and check that page out as well if you need the link we can share it with you finally don't stress the session is being recorded so if you miss anything or you need something repeated you can always go back and watch the recording later on so Brooke I think we do need to go back one more slide so I can talk about the goals for the evening perfect thank you so as I mentioned this is our first monthly hang out that we're planning to host for the exploring computer science community hopefully those of you who are joining us are a part of the exploring computer science program at code.org if you're not that's okay we hope you'll also get something out of the conversation this evening but our goal really is to connect folks who are teaching the ecs curriculum across the United States we have a powerful crew of hundreds of teachers across the country who are doing this work and we think if we work together and connect as a community we can really make a difference in computer science education and these monthly hangouts are one way we want to do that each month we're going to be talking about a hot topic related to that part of the school year this month we are focusing on how to get get get it set up for success so we're going to hear a little bit some tips and how you can kick off your classroom like this september's we're also going to take a tour of some new resources that we have a bit available for the exploring computer science classroom we're going to talk about tips and tricks and then finally the last part of the meeting will be questions concerns and feedback and that's where we're going to use Twitter and the Google+ Hangouts event page to post your question so broke i think we think i'll head to slides and at this point i'm going to hand it over to Danny McAvoy is going to talk you through some important reminders for the month Danny alright guys so we have two important reminders this month they have to do with our pd and a hot topic of assessments all right so first of all tomorrow night I know that you probably like your nights free and we're booking you up but there is a very important webinar being run by cs10k on the SR I assessments for ecs so these are going to be unit tests they can be done with paper and pencil there a lot of short answer type questions but more of those details will be given out on the webinar tomorrow so you should take a look at that link and head over to that webinar to find out more the other thing to just remind you of is phase 3 in person rpd for that will be starting in about two weeks depending on where you are it may be another week or two after that but take a look at that link that I've put their that updates you on where your PD is depending on your area of the country and when it is happening so make sure you take a look at both of those links before you leave us tonight alright brick next slide alright so i'm going to introduce our guest speaker flow flow was a co.org ecs teacher last year she started with us and she works in Oakland so she's going to tell us about her ecs experience and then give you some tips for the year hi I'm flow I teach in Oakland a very whom urban School District last year we had a great time with ecs I had a class that was probably eighty five percent female and in fact all of them are going on to continuance of computer science and engineering pathways and one thing I'm really excited about my last year's classes that we had a lot of them a lot of Muslim girls in in ninth graders too and they came in extremely shy extremely quiet um and when I see them in the hallways now I know that it was a part of that UCS curriculum um but we're going to get started with some top tips that you can use to make your ecs classroom successful i'm the first one that we have is confidence confidence is cute i looked up the word confidence and the dictionary is defined as a noun in the feeling that you can rely on someone or that someone can rely on you and what I like about confidence is that it is a thing right it is a noun so it is something that we can we can learn we can gain and then not just confidence in the subject of cs i'm i am a math teacher and so my CS confidence is not that great but i do have the confidence that I can help kids get to a further place and to help them learn something and so they trusted me and they rely on me um the next tip that we have is called established participation so like established as in it's a part of the class a normal part of the class every day students come in they expect to participate but that doesn't happen organically so we have to create structures that promote positive participation I'm keeping equity in mind so not just asking students to raise their hands but creating ways for them personally to participate we have to make participation not be an option in fact that my class participation is is woven into their grade points and finally rewarding participation efforts when you see students doing something that you like call that out teach them how to participate because often students don't know what works in a group and what doesn't work in a group it takes a lot of practice tip number three is building community so we often I think as teachers take this one for granted oh we don't want to spend all this time getting to know our students or we need to get started in the curriculum but I have found that if you take this time in the beginning is going to go much smoother you mean so create a safe learning environment let students know like your classroom is like Vegas what happens there stays there play some name games go and talk to elementary school teachers find out what you can do because we might think it's a little childish but it's the way that we get kids to trust us and finally integrate some positive classroom rituals I'm at the end of my class we take away time to give props to each other for the way we participated for the way that we spoke to our classmates I'm just reinforcing those positive things and then making it a ritual so it's something that we do every day the next tip that we have is make the material relevant right like sometimes we think Oh kids just want to do CS because it's awesome but I don't think that they realize how awesome it is most of our students are consumers and not creators so some things that you can do is conduct an interest are they just ask them what it is they like and then it's all new though to figure out how to connect those things I'm consider wide ranges of cs careers when you're talking about careers and also considered a history of cs and contributions of women and people of color students have a lot of ideas and they come from all over the place so we want to reach them where they are the next tip is to create outside relationships oh I cannot tell you how important this is I'm i remember when i started teaching the student actually I lived at the school um and then when they saw me at the football game on Friday night it was like I was a whole different person go to a sports activity sponsor a club I mean it can be something as simple as having your door open for students to come in and eat their lunch when they see you as somebody other than their teacher like they can trust you and that also boosts your own confidence the next tip that I have is to be intentional so everything that you do have to have a purpose from the warmup question to the homework that you give to UM the way that you set up your chairs right so have clear plans be organized in practice good time management do this know when we're faking they know we don't have anything to do and we don't want to create that kind of environment the next tip that we have our partners partners partners so it is very important that we collaborate with other people in this area just like we expect our students to collaborate one of our first partners that we have to get on board or our parents and gardens you have to make the initial content you have to be the one to call them make some positive phone calls I'm get involved with their community see who is available to help in Oakland I'm a few miles away from Silicon Valley but I want to make sure that I get those partners involved um and also your staff and your faculty at your school let them know where you're doing let them come check out your classroom so you can expand your program um the next step that we have is number eight and that tip says that all of this stuff can be learned right um none of these skills are innate we are not born with any of them um if you have a trouble with confidence stand in the mirror in the morning and tell yourself how great you are if you're having trouble with classroom management make a plan in fact this year I made a poster just for myself and I put it on the wall and it says stay calm check for understanding and knowledge dollars like those are the three things that help my class I swim run I have to remind myself all the time and that's okay because I figure by the next week or so it's going to be something that I do all the time so you can learn these skills and then finally the very last tip is to have fun oh my we transfer our fun to the students and if we come in with awesome attitudes they will have awesome attitudes and we will learn a lot and they will really be hooked and they will really be engaged and so have a very successful year awesome thank you for that was so great it was great hearing about your experience and what help make your classroom a really positive environment we're going to have questions for flow at the end so are we doing them right now Brooke do you looks like we have to slide up for them now so we can take a couple questions for flow right now I think Melissa might have them if we have any that account so let me know so if you have a question for flow you can go ahead and tweet it with hashtag code or pd and we'll ask her for you or you can go to the event page on Google+ and enter it there so flow while we're waiting to get some questions from the audience at a question from you for you what the knowledge dollar oh okay so so knowledge dollars are these really cool like slips of paper they're worth one book but I give them out like when I ever I see students doing things that are great whenever they're doing things I want them to do whenever they are being great and okay please don't laugh at me but like I tell them like I try to make it rain knowledge dollars all the time um because then I have like I call it the knowledge dollar store and things are super expensive like a candy bar is like 25 knowledge dollars like you have to be on point all the time um but they love them it is so amazing how high school students like just jump on that kind of stuff I feel like everything that I've ever done I've got from a middle school teacher oradell an interesting teacher but it totally works and it's it's easy for me is cheap it's just paper I cut it up um and the things that I by don't cost me that much money so that it works another quick question related to that you know you're starting ecs again this year was what lesson are you starting with what are you going to kick off with what are you rollin so all last week we did um just a bunch of community building activities um we did tower building activities we did an activity called broken circles um we did a lot of stuff from building intentional communities so that's a website that's so that's all we did last week so now I have two sections of ecs with 30 kids in both of them I know all their names they know my name we all know each other things we know things that we like we actually watch some videos I mean so now when I talk about how important ecs is they understand and so today we did the lesson what is a computer I like had to shut that thing down like how intense and awesome the debate got between students and so but we were able to get that intense because they knew each other they knew how to respect each other there um I mean even things like giving them sentence starters how to respectfully disagree with somebody else those are all things that I do intentionally to make sure that the classroom flows well thanks it's super helpful to hear hey Brooke I'm not sure how to share the link for the plus page in case people want to post questions you have any suggestions there we could turn on showcase and share it there we could also post it over on the monthly meeting the monthly meeting page directly on the event page a good idea like I notice under me I don't know if of guests have this but under me there's a thing that says links if you click on that that it'll take you there as well so if you have a question you can go there and we're going to have a section of the call later where we'll have Q&A for Danny and Brooks so you'll definitely want to find that page to go there and post questions but so we want to thank you so much for your time it's so great to hear about your experience and I know that you're available right to help folks out if they have questions throughout the year oh yes absolutely wonderful great well thank you so much and I hand it back to dance you so much thank you Danny take it away alright guys so um one of the things we heard from a lot of our teachers last year and some of you guys at PD this summer is you would love some more support for the curriculum different things like hey does anybody have a really cool assessment idea that we could see or what is the structure of a semester course with ecs so ah we're going to show you the resource we have created it's called the code org ecs teacher resource folder and it's going to help us bring together resources that all of the teachers who've taught ecs or teaching ecs currently want to share and it'll also bring in some code.org created resources so i'm going to show my screen now so if you want if you had clicked on Brooke and you weren't actually watching me talk that's okay but you might want to click on my picture as I share my screen and show you how this folder works alrighty so I'm going to go into the resource folder as you would see it when you shop sign in I know that you don't have the link yet that's okay we're just going to follow along for now and we'll share the links with you very soon ah so this is the resource folder when you pop in here a couple things to notice um there are folders for each unit there's also a general course resource folder or recruiting resources and a teacher submitted resource folder and then these two lovely things down the bottom which probably some of the most important things for this resource folder first of all I'm going to click on this one as it loads I'll tell you it's the how to document so if you the label wasn't there if it was over here which is how it formats normally um you'll see that it says how to use the resource folder and this is going to be your guide so I'm going to show you a lot of things but if you don't catch everything I said are you like reading it or you just need some more help ah this will give you most of those details and then anything else you need help with feel free to send a forum post our way and we'll get you an answer okay so what's in this how to dock well it'll tell you generally what the resource folder is it'll tell you what's in the resource folder what different resources you can find in the general the units and the lessons I gives you the link there's also a breakdown of how to submit a resource so lots of different information here great resource to look through and check out before you start trying to dive in and figure out what is this resourceful they're actually doing alright second we're going to take a look in the general course resource folder so it's this first one over here i'm going to open it up alright so in here you'll see lots of different things this is just like hey if I want to get a big picture of how this course works I'm going to come to this folder and this folder contains things like the standards mapping so down here I can click there's the link to the SR I standard mapping all the different mappings that they've done great resource right here for you we also have the ecs calendar so we've heard from a lot of people like hey if I'm doing this and I want to get through all six units what should my pacing be so we've given you a general pacing for that we've also had a bunch of questions about what should i do if i have a semester course and here's a general outline of what that would look like as well so you can come in take a look if you have questions about that we'd love to hear them there's also other resources like this learning strategies doc so we've been working on this for our computer science principles curriculum but it's actually applicable to anything you've ever wanted to teach in your whole life it's just a bunch of strategies about how to teach stuff how to do group work how to do a share out how to do a wrapup so lots of different ideas in here it's really long but there's lots of links and ways to navigate easily so you should be able to find what you're looking for and get different ideas as I'm sure you've all seen in pd there's gallery walk so lots of the ideas in here something to take a look at if you're lost for an idea on how to run a lesson all right throughout this you also see that there's the ecs resources so what we've done is that huge dock that we printed for you or if you're not a code or teacher the dock that you have on your computer right we taken that and we've broken it down so it's a lot easier to digest you don't have to digest it in one big thing it's broken apart so there's lots of different things here's the course overview that you'll find at the beginning you can take a look through that and read it if you want so all of those are scattered throughout where they make sense all right so now let's look at this spreadsheet this is one of the coolest pieces of this resource folder at least I think so it's going to be the way that you're going to share resources with other teachers and other teachers can share resources with you so this is what's going to give us that ability for everybody to share so here you'll see I've submitted a couple resources just to fill it in so we can take a look at how this works and right what you'll notice is I'm going to tab down the bottom here that says all responses but I could go to things that are general resources or say I wanted to look at the unit to resources I can click on those tabs and find out what resources exist for that hopefully this will grow and when it grows it maybe get come too big to deal with right I want unit to resource but there's just so many of them so how do I deal with that well let's take a look back let's go back to our folder here our original location sorry it's taking a second to load as I'm screen sharing all right and let's go to unit 2 so I'm click on the unit 2 folder and you'll notice that in here there's also a spreadsheet that says unit to resources and that is where it will pull out all the resources that are specific to unit 2 from that big spreadsheet and it's going to take a second to load when you do this because it has to pull from that spreadsheet but it will load and you'll be able to see that it's broken down by day so down the bottom here where we before had units we now can see a breakdown by day so I think there was a resource for one of these days I don't remember which one obviously it's not going to show me right now let's see let's go back to the original page all right it's taking a sec to load because I'm trying to present to you and do this at the same time so we're just going to let it go but it would load you could look at that specific day and see the resources for that day while we're in unit 2 let's take a look at what's in here um as I said before all the unit to specific things from ecs curriculum are in here there's also this nice code.org created resource so we heard from a bunch of teachers that they didn't exactly know what the homework was that they needed to give on certain days or what supplies they needed for class or when they needed computers so we've created this resource that breaks it down by day or lesson because lessons are multiple days sometimes and tells you if you need computers what supplies you might need and what homework you might need to assign this is just the minimum homework you need to decide to make the course function so you can take a look through those they're very helpful lastly within the unit 2 folder you'll see it broken down by day and within a day we can go in and click and we find out there's more resources so any resource you may need for that day is hopefully in there I'm going to jump out to the unit one for a sec and go into day one to show you some of the other things we're working on so as I said this is getting this is going to grow and one of the things is code.org wants to help grow it as well but we haven't got all of the resources for everything put in yet but for unit one right now there are exit tickets for the lesson so little assessment questions that you could ask students to see if they understood that lesson for the day in addition there's a list of links and extra resources that you can use also a link to the forum if you've been using that it's linked in here as well so those are inside a day and then within that day you'll also find another breakdown of that spreadsheet which is probably going to take too long to load again because I'm trying to share with you at the same time but within that you'll see that there's a breakdown of the so within that day um you can hold on let's see if it'll load because i want to show you it's pretty cool so within that day right i will show you in a sec oh there it goes so this doesn't have any resources that's why you see the na at the top cuz nobody submitted any if you want to submit one you'll be the first um but down the bottom where it used to say days now it has the types of resources so you can take a look and be like hey I want a video resource and you click that tab and show you all the video resources for this lesson alright so now the big thing how do i submit things right so we went through this whole process and we said well it'd be cool if we can share things but we don't know how so let's talk about how we do that so there's this teacher submitted resource odd folder and one of the things you'll notice about this folder is you can't touch any of the other folders or resource you can't mess with them and edit them you can however make a copy and if you're wondering how to make a copy and then be able to edit it that's in the house you doc I'm not going to go over it now but definitely take a look all right but if I want to submit a resource head into the teacher submitted folder you'll notice i put a resource in here before we're going to let's see i'm going to actually open this in my drive so that i can add resources to it you should be able to edit this folder so you'll have access to that so I'm gonna open and drive and I'm gonna go on that teacher submitted resource folder I'm actually going to remove this because it's going to be my demo sneaky sneaky alright so in here it's where I'm going to want to add that document so over here I'm going to find my document where did it go up there it is so I'm going to bring it i can drag it in that's one way or you can also go in here and click new and file upload you don't know how to do that if that's new to you feel free to look through the how to dock it goes over it step by step you'll notice down the bottom here it's loading telling me how long it has all right it's almost done and it'll show up in a spec unsec should come up there it is alright so I'm going to need a link to this resource to be able to share it with people if it's a website or a video write those all have links that makes sense this folder is meant to be for resources that are mostly documents that you can't have a link to easily if it's already up on the web you can just copy the link for that as it already exists you don't have to necessarily put it in here but for documents that you may have created yourself definitely going to want to put them up here so people can find them all right so I'm going to get the link to this resources I'm right clicking or control clicking on this and I can say get link and it gives me the link there I'm just going to copy it we're going to need it for later so right now it's copied can get at it later alright I'm going to head to our sharing of the oh boo i typed it wrong all right I'm going to go through it the back way you won't see that breakdown but you'll see this live form okay live form this is where you're going to submit the resources first two questions are name and email you do not have to answer those if you don't want to those are just there so that if someone likes your resource they could give you a shout out and be like hey i love this resource i use it all the time or maybe they want to ask you a question or maybe they edit the doc and they come up with a new cool idea and they want to share it with you and you get a better experience or maybe you learn something from their experience maybe they're like hey this happened in my classroom my classroom is different than yours so that's optional up to you whether or not you want to give those then you'll identify the type of resource so we have that document it was a reading on big data so it doesn't necessarily fit any one of these specifically so I'm just going to click resource other up to you how you identify it's just helpful for other teachers so it's based off data so I'm going to put it in unit 5 when I pick the unit and then here's where I put the link so I'm just going to hit paste and that long length that I had copied over gets put there we put that link it's really important that you get the link right because that's how other teachers are going to find it so when we listed in the spreadsheet that's how they're going to get to it then details of the resource you can click and type those out here so this is a big data reading something doesn't have to be very long probably shouldn't be very long but just something to give ideas for the teacher who might be looking at it and then why did you use or create this resource right so give them a reason for using it um and then if you click continue you'll get to a screen that asks you what day this is for if it's for a specific unit and so my resource isn't really for a specific day I didn't pick one that was for a specific day so I can just put other but you have options for any of the days for that lesson and your end of unit assessment if you don't know which day it is take a look back at the resource folder it has that breakdown so I'm going to click other and then submit and the coolest part of this is we're going to go find it so we're going to go see that it's populated live so it wasn't in there before but it will be now right so let's go and take a look here up so I still had it open and there it is you'll see that that gray line down the bottom here this is a big data reading that was exactly what i typed really exciting right and you'll see that you can click on that and go to that resource so if I click here it opens up that reading for me and I can take a look through it pretty awesome it also remember populates into unit 5 so let's just check that and see if we can see it in our unit 5 might take a sec to load so remember that this is pulling from another spreadsheet so you'll see that it says loading it's going to have this bar up in the corner that's going to take it a minute to load that's okay it just means that we're going to be able to constantly update so nobody from code.org has to go in and say like approved resource you can add this to this to the list we will check them if we find really good ones we're going to add them to the folder over time but for now this allows you to add and as soon as you add other teachers can see it and decide if they want to use it as well so the constant updating and there it is this line right here that resource that we submitted so pretty cool it'll keep updating as you go and if there's anything new it would show me that as well all right so that is the resource folder so I'm going to stop sharing my screen and we're going to take a look at what's next on our list I think it's QA about the resource folder that's right Danny and about any other questions that folks have as you're getting your year started so again you can go ahead and tweet any questions you have for Danny Brooke for myself or flow she's still here to code or PB on twitter I'll be monitoring that or Brooke will also explain to you how you can use the Q&A feature on google hangout yeah I'm actually going to switch my screen really quickly and show you a different a different window so this is the we're getting meta now this is showing you the live stream of of the hangout on air that we are currently in so if you have a question there's this questions menu over on the right just click a question type it in here click Submit and that will push through directly to us we will be able to access that I've also seen a couple people posting in the in the event itself so you can post their we're also monitoring that so feel free to post in either of those places and we will pull from there as well so to get things started while we're waiting for some questions to come in Oh first Danny did you want to share links with folks yeah we can share the links so if we just want to put the screen up will um so as I was going through I told you that we'd share the links later I've made nice bitly link so you don't have to remember those really long Google folder blah blah blah links I'll be pain in the butt so code ecs teacher resources is the folder and to submit a resource oh I said resources that's why I got it wrong so the submit resource is the other one so that'll take you to that live form to submit the resources also at the end we're going to post a link to the forum and it has these links in there as well as the links that i put up earlier about PD and the hangout tomorrow night to find out about the SR I ecs assessments so you miss the changes you'll be able to find them there yep we will make sure that we consolidate all these links for you in one place so you don't have to dig through the through the presentation to get that so while we're waiting on some questions to come in Danny and I will switch back my screen so folks can see how to how to submit those questions I'm curious since you've been spending so much time in this resource folder what you think is is most exciting or most useful as someone fresh out of the classroom what do you wish you had for your classes that you taught last year that we have in the resource folder well I really so I'm a very organized person and I've started to impose this on people at code.org I like organized folders that you know i can find stuff and I know where it is and it's easy so my favorite thing I use the resource folder as I'm trying to find ways to improve ecs or need to reference what the number of days are in a unit or whatever I go in and I look at the folders and so the folders are really nice because they have all those details and I don't have to go digging through the dock or flipping through a book right I just say okay I want something about unit 1 ahead into unit 1 and there's the daily break down right there for me of unit 1 so I find that really helpful I'm a very like tree structured organized person I like things in folders so I guess that's probably the best part of it for me but I know that as a teacher I also really like when people tell me all right what is the like minimum viable thing that I need to happen today to make this happen maybe like you know teaching your you're just like all right I have a couple different preps how do I make this lesson happen and it's really simple because it's broken down into like here's what you need to have for resources that list is there so here's the supplies I need for the lesson today do I need computers what should I assign for homework if I forget like all else what what do I need to assign for homework tonight that's all there for you and then you have the nice lesson plans that ecs created so they're there and all that's right in one place and that's so helpful I think yeah I really love that for every unit number one there's a really consistent and predictable structure like you're saying but also for every unit we've got all of these documents straight from straight from the curriculum organized already so in addition to the daily lesson plans if I want a reminder of what the daily chart looks like from the unit I can see that you also created this super handy calendar which is really nice to just be able to pop into for a reminder of how of how the days are structured i agree i think that's a really really cool thing I'm curious if for the teacher submitted resources as hopefully we get more and more of those in in the next couple of weeks I'm curious if we've thought about a way to to support the the use of those resources with the forum so you know maybe like as resources are coming in and people can post in the forums and talk about hey I found this great resource in the folder what do you guys think about it so do you have any suggestions for how people could share the resources that they were pulling out of the folder with other ecs teachers yeah so um just so you guys know this is the sneak peek we haven't even actually send an email announcing the resource folder so you guys are getting super inside information right now hence why there isn't a lot of teacher submitted resources um we are also trying to make the forum and the folder work together so the forum has been updated it's still in the process of getting some more updates but you'll find that there's a couple different topics under each day so within a unit you can find the different days broken down and then you'll find for each day there are lesson resources and that will connect to the folder so they'll be a link and you can find resources that would also be a great place to talk about them you can also there's a general question and answer section there'll be a PD discussion topic so you guys have already been discussing different questions from the online PD that will continue and those will be in their own thread and then we'll also have an assessment thread so that's another place where you can share resources that would be one that's specific to assessment so hey how do i read a unit 1 assessment or how do i read an assessment just for this day like i want kids to create something what should they create at the end of the day so that's where you guys can have those conversations and that'll be um growing and changing right we're trying to update with you guys and take your feedback and so we're making sure that we integrate that you just got to bear with us as some things change a little bit along the way to make that experience better for you so you said that we're trying to respond to feedback and help people with the questions that they have and help support the ideas they have what's the best way for folks to give feedback on either the forums or on the the resource folders how would you like to get that feedback ah so you can post it on the forum um so if you have feedback for a specific day I would suggest posting it on that day I actually read all of the forum posts every single one of them so if you have a question like you just put it in that forum post I'll see it I'll get back to you so it it all populates to my email and I read them all and make sure that you guys are getting the feedback you need on any questions you have so if you just want to post it in the forum you can create a topic for it as well if we think it'd be helpful we can create a topic for feedback for a unit so up to you guys how you want to post that but if you post anything to the forum I will see it and i'll get back to you great thank you so much Danny I think we're going to wrap up now I want to thank everyone for joining us and participating this evening don't forget that the session has been recorded so we'll be sharing the recording link with you or you can just go back to the YouTube page
