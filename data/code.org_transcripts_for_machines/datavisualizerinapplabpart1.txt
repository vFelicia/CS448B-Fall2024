hi everyone i'm going to show you how to use the data visualizer tool in app lab this tool will let you look at the data in the different data sets in a number of different ways i'll show you how to access it and how to use its features first you're going to want to go to the data tab over here the first thing you're going to want to do is import a data set so you can look through the categories of data sets here you can even preview what's in a data set by clicking on this preview button right here this will give you an example of the data that's contained in this data set this might give you an idea of whether you're interested in using this data or not you can also click on this more info button to see the metadata associated with that data set this will tell you about the source of the data any cleaning that might have been done to the data set and more details about the data that's contained in each of the columns once you've imported the data set it should show up over here on the right hand side let's take a look at this ap computer science test taker data set once you click on it you'll see all the data show up here with the columns across the top and the values going down the visualizer tool is up here where it says visualize data once you click on it you'll see this popup show up this is where you're going to do the work of actually creating your data visualizations across the top you'll see that there's a place to put a title in for your chart you can choose between what type of chart you want to make you can make a bar chart a histogram a scatter plot or a cross tab let's start by looking at a bar chart if we're going to make a bar chart we first need to decide which value it is that we want to graph now we can look at these values in this dropdown and choose that way or we can go back to the metadata tab over here and read a little bit more about what each column contains let's say we're interested in this column right here total percent female what percentage of students who took an apcs test in that state were female go back over here to the visualizer tab and select that variable from this dropdown now this bar chart shows across the xaxis the percentages so the total percentage of test takers in an estate that identified as female the height of each bar shows the number of states that shared that percentage so for example six different states had 30 percent of their cs test takers identify as female and now this bar chart is helpful for answering certain types of questions it's helpful for learning some information but there are other ways that we can visualize this data as well for example we can make a histogram and let's look at the same value as before total percent female when we make a histogram the first thing we need to decide is the bucket size or the range that each categories are going to represent in this case percent so we could have each category be two percent and this is what the chart would look like we can have it be ten percent and this is what the chart would like again this is the same data just being visualized in different ways let's go with five percent buckets now this is the same data we looked at in the bar chart but we can see different things here so instead of unique percentages we can see a range of percentages so we can see that 22 states had between 25 and 30 of their cs test takers identify as female and this type of visualization can be helpful for answering different types of questions and learning different type of information later we'll learn more about the other types of visualizations you can make with this visualizer tool you
