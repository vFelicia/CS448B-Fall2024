hi everybody Welcome to the 2016 hour of code uh I don't see any classrooms in there I'm going to have Maddie from my team put a click in the in the chat room uh the chat window to say how you can join because I'd love to actually see the there's apparently 37 or 38 classrooms all at once uh looking in on this on this broadcast but since I don't see you it kind of feels empty to me um but I'm just going to talk to to you know the classrooms out there you know there's welcome to the hour of code this is the second day of Computer Science Education week and the hour of code campaign is something that you know we launched just three years ago it's been amazing to see this campaign spread not just throughout the country but throughout the entire world uh in in just the last three years so today on the three year anniversary of the hour of code starting the the fourth year of the campaign we just announced that 300 million hours of code have been done by students and students have have written 20 billion lines of code that's such an incredibly large number to you know to put it into context you know the average phone you know my phone has maybe 50 million lines of code you know students across the world have written almost a thousand times as much code as it takes to create something like the Apple operating system or the Windows operating system I couldn't be more proud of what we've done with this campaign uh you know I started code.org because of this belief that every student in every school should have the the chance the opportunity to learn computer science well I started learning coding myself on my own when I was 12 years old and back when I started it wasn't nearly as fun it wasn't nearly as easy it wasn't nearly as accessible but I fell in love with it because when you write code when you do work creating technology you're not just solving problems you actually are creating things that are yours that you can share that you can show other people it's a lot like art it's a lot like creative writing it's a lot like music except because it's technology you can click a button and instantly have it spread to lots of other people and you know I've had a fantastic career personally in technology because of the the success I've had learning to code right now where we are in our current world is that the opportunity that I had is something that every student should have we live in a world where we all carry cell phones in our pockets every new car has tons of computers in it every industry is being changed by computer science that the community you know the communication we have via phones and telephones and whatnot are all being managed by computers are entertainment in movies and music videos and animations are all being created by computers agriculture is being planned using using computers uh banking Commerce manufacturing everything you see around us is being impacted by technology yet our schools don't teach even the basics of how this technology Works how to create it what's an algorithm what's inside an app how does the internet work what's cyber security about how does encryption work these are all topics that impact not just kids but adults and the impact every job and every type of field of study and so getting students and schools to learn computer science just like we learn English and math and reading and history is something that every school in the entire world should do with the hour of code you get the chance to spend at least one hour on coding and computer science to see what it's like and then you can decide from there do you want to go beyond one hour or not and you know code.org and hundreds of Partners have made this campaign work and spread throughout the entire world I want to see if I can get questions from the audience to to answer at night still I can't really actually see any of the folks out there but I would love to see if you have any questions all right well I have one question here uh and this is from Alice in uh in Idaho and she asks what's the best way to get my school district on board with the hour of code and with computer science Alice that's a great question uh you know the hour of code is really just the first step of adding computer science to a school's curriculum or to a school's program you know we don't have an hour of math we have math every day all week all year we don't just have an hour of English we don't just have an hour of science and computer science is just as important as some of these fields that needs to be integrated into the school system so you know what I'd recommend Alice is to to approach your school's Administration after the hour of code show them how much the the students and classrooms enjoyed it and asked them to make a computer science a priority within the school or the district and in fact if you go to the uh the code.org website and click the little button that says stats there's actually a letter there there's a template letter that you can send to any principal or administrator that tells you how to do that all right the next question uh says my kids love the hour of code but what's the best thing to do when they get stuck uh so um I'm assuming that's coming from a teacher who uh has to sort with how to how to add students deal with basically you know if you get stuck doing one of the hour of code tutorials the first thing I'd say is coding may start easy and fun it's not easy for anybody this isn't something that the adults learned when they were growing up any of the teachers in these classrooms weren't coders every teacher in America learned math and English when they were growing up when they were children almost none of them learned computer science or coding just because it's so new and it's not been available in school so if you're stuck it's not because you're dumb and you can't sort it out it's because you know learning computer programming involves making mistakes making bugs trying it different ways until you get it to work now if you try many different ways and you still can't get it to work the easiest thing to do is ask another student to show you how the only way to learn is from making mistakes and then and then having somebody walk you through it and what's fun about this is instead of asking just the teacher to show you you can also engage other students in doing this as well because you know when you when you're in math class and you make the mistake the teacher is usually the expert and that's who you go to when you're doing computer science if your teacher is new to it as well all of you are learning together and that's something you can Embrace and enjoy uh and you can just raise your hand and say I'm stuck here can anybody help me out uh you know don't be stuck quietly and I'm really serious about this because you might be in a one of these steps of one of these puzzles and you know you're not getting it right and you're not sure how and then you're just stuck there and sitting raise your hand and ask for help and ask the whole classroom hey does anybody figured out how to do number five and then everybody can help each other that's the best way to do it um there's a question from April de Janeiro saying uh what was your main inspiration for starting the hour of code this is a great question uh you know the idea for the hour of code is literally only three years old it's so amazing that this is a program that is that is now worldwide in entire countries uh but what happened is code.org had started as a very simple effort to get schools to think about uh adding computer science to their course to their courses in their schools and tens of thousands of teachers had reached out to us saying we'd love to do some kind of computer science in our school but every school is different there's elementary schools there's middle schools there's high schools some schools are ready to put a full course in their program some just want an afterschool program so what I thought was what's the one thing that every school can do what's the one thing that every student could do that's funny enough and easy enough and the idea we thought is how about just one hour of computer science just to give it a shot and you know the goal of the hour of code isn't that everybody's going to become a coder in one hour and the reality is most of you aren't going to become coders when you grow up the real goal of the hour of code is for you to recognize this is what it's about and to realize that this is fun so that if if you like it you can go on into it and pursue it longer and I hope most of you enjoy it I hope most of you consider doing this much much longer than an hour because you know the real goal is for many of you to take 100 hours of computer science and learn just as much computer science as you'd learn a subject like science or history um the next question is from Elizabeth at people's Elementary in Peachtree City in Georgia uh so Elizabeth asks what would you say to help students persevere and I guess this is a little similar to the question about what you do when when you get stuck but you know the Great the great thing I'd say is that you know almost all kind of learning has ups and downs sometimes it's easy sometimes it's fun sometimes it's hard the the cool thing about writing code is that there's always a way to get it right but there's not just one right answer you know with math there's often problems where you know three plus three the answer is six and if you get it right you're right and if you get it wrong you're wrong when you're creating something using Code it's it's a little bit like math but it's a lot like art as well there's often multiple ways of doing the same thing because sometimes you're given a puzzle and there's five or six different ways you can solve it or you're just given something where it's not a puzzle you can just make whatever you want and you can make your own rules uh and so realizing that there's not only one right answer and you can make your own rules is one of the best ways to to get past sort of a problem when you're stuck um there's a question from students in Houston saying what's your favorite part about the hour of code my favorite part by far is hearing from students hearing from teachers seeing how much fun classrooms have with doing this and you know it's sometimes sometimes there's issues sometimes not everything works out perfectly but you know we make make it work but knowing that's literally worldwide this week tens of millions of students are all together participating in this campaign and coding all the same time not just using code.org tutorials by using fantastic tutorials from companies like like scratch like Tinker like the new Moana tutorial by Disney the new Minecraft tutorial by Microsoft there's so many different activities people are doing and just knowing how much the kids are enjoying it and seeing the looks on their faces interacting with students in schools is by far my favorite thing all right next question I have time for two more questions uh I have a there's a question from a teacher asking how we uh how we manage to get the prime minister of Canada to kick off this year's hour of code and what was that like uh so in case you didn't see it yesterday you know we we always try to do something special for the for the first day of launching of the hour of code so two years ago I had the Good Fortune of helping President Obama write his first line of JavaScript code using the Anna and Elsa Frozen tutorial today we uh or yesterday we were in Canada to kick off the international campaign uh from you know the prime ministers with the prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and two lucky classrooms in Ottawa it was snowing out there so it was you know it felt like Christmas uh and the prime minister of Canada said something really special this is a guy who he's currently you know the head of state he's like the president of the country but he used to be a he used to study Engineering in school so he said that he studied C plus plus programming when he was in college and he even done logo programming which is a lot like the Frozen artists tutorials that code.org has so he was very familiar with it and he was saying how you know even though he's running a country right now Having learned how to do code helps him take very big problems and break them into smaller pieces and also helps build the confidence that if you can tell a computer what to do you can build a system you can design things then you can design things to do anything and it helps build your own sort of problemsolving skills it was so fantastic to be able to kick off a campaign you know with the head of a country and he's one of the most popular prime ministers in the world um there's two more questions there's one student saying what coding language should I learn I'm guessing this is a high school student because when you're in elementary school and even an early middle school all the coding is in drag and drop platforms like code.org or like Tinker or like scratch once you reach high school but once you're older there's so many different computer programming languages but the thing I'd say is computer languages are not like spoken languages if you want to learn French there's 10 000 words to memorize everything has a different word every object every verb everything is different if you want to learn a different coding language there's only about a hundred maybe 200 words to recognize and they all use the same grammar so it's always the ordering of things is the same how do you do a repeat Loop in one language okay you need to learn you know sometimes it uses semicolons sometimes are used as parentheses that part is different but it's still maybe 100 or 200 words and they're very similar so any language you start with you can learn a different computer programming language and maybe two three weeks once you get good at one you can get go to the next one so pick whichever one you want the language that code.org recommends people start with is Javascript but there's many other languages it depends on really what you want to build so if you want to build an IOS app for for your iPhone you would need to learn the Swift language if you want to build a Android app for a different phone you'd want to use the the Java programming language if you want to build a website there's a different language for that so you can start on any one of them and then learn the next one um the last question from Maura is what is next for code.org after the hour of code and this is a great question to close on at you know the goal of the hour of code isn't for every student to learn for just one hour goal and the goal of all the organizations and all the teachers who are participating in this is for students to be prepared for 21st century that it's being changed in by technology in ways that we can't even predict technology is moving much faster than any of us have been prepared for so so the goal of the hour of code and the goal of code.org is to change the entire school system to teach computer science just like we teach Math Science History foreign languages and the Arts and so what happens for us behind it's the hour of code and Beyond the hour of code is to work with schools and especially with teachers to teach multiple hours of code as full year school year long courses just like math class just like history class just like biology class and so for every one of you doing the hour of code today as if you're teachers if you enjoy it I encourage you to go on and if you visit code.org or visit the hour of code website there's buttons and links for how to go beyond an hour of code don't stop at one hour if you enjoy it whether alone as a student or with your classroom go go and go beyond that and ask your school to teach full computer science um I'm out of time and I want to let you all get back to your actual coding so I just want to say thank you so much to all the teachers and to all the students for participating in this year's hour of code it's so incredible to be part of creating something that has reached literally 300 million hours of code have been done by at least one out of 10 students on the entire planet so each one of you in your classrooms if you look around there's 300 000 classrooms just like that kids on every country in the plan on the planet from Russia to Bangladesh from Armenia to Japan from Argentina to Zimbabwe everywhere in refugee camps even you know everywhere students are doing the hour of code it's so cool to be part of something that's Global in this way I hope you have a great time thank you so much and enjoy your coding byebye
