so today i brought in a super special craft project yay are you guys ready yeah so it's it's it's kind of hard to see can you guys see it it's a panda on a string so i'm going to call this a sun catcher because it looks like something i might hang from the mirror in my car right when you drive so that the sun shines off of it or it could be something you put on a zipper on your jacket or on your backpack you can use it for whatever you want to use it for but this is what we're going to make so what we're going to do now is i'm going to tell you out loud how we're going to make it and then i want you to repeat it back to me okay so listening ears on are you ready bead knot bead not spacer not oh wait i'm not done yet bead not bead not spacer not panda special bead not everyone will have a panda so we'll call it a special bead and then a finishing knot to make sure that it all stays on so do you think you guys remember that okay ready go through it with me here we go okay we're going to try it again listen to me because we're going to call this a special bead and we're going to call this a finishing knot okay it's just a little bit different than the other ones bead good job you guys okay so now just in case we risk forgetting what we just did we're gonna write the instructions down so everyone can look at it when it's time to make your own okay here we go so what was the first thing go ahead yeah you can go ahead and shout it out all right what was the first thing bead and after that there's definitely a pattern what else are we noticing we could just repeat right but we don't have a repeat command here so we can't use one so we're going to write all the instructions down but what are what's happening here we're running out of room we have to figure out what we're gonna do if we went ahead and finished our pattern and put not here then we could just say to repeat this whole thing and we'd get a lot closer right but would we have room for everything no yeah we can make another block number seven and number eight until we go to this panda or the special okay so she's saying well but we could make more boxes and we don't have room to make more boxes here but what do you guys notice more boxes more boxes that's right so we do have room over here and over here where we can write some things so here's what i want to do i'm going to give you all a copy of this worksheet you guys are going to work in groups and this is the program this is like what what we're doing here and here are our two extra boxes now if we wanted to call let's see i'm gonna erase these out real quick if we had something in here and we said banana let's say banana what swordfish if we had banana swordfish over here how would i get this to call banana swordfish do you suppose i could write banana swordfish would that have saved me any room in my program yeah no repeat you could write f1 i could write f1 so if i write f1 you guys are gonna know that i go over here and i read through f1 before i go any further you get it okay so here's what i'm gonna do now i'm handing out the worksheets i'll have one here you three are going to work together all right now i want you to figure out how you use your two extra boxes you've got to call your box and your program remember to be careful not to over teach the fun in this lesson comes from letting the kids explore different options and having different answers to the same problem so let them figure it out and only go to them if they have a question the important part of this lesson is actually the wrap up because as you saw we kind of snuck the idea of a function on them and it's important that they don't really know that they're learning until afterwards so they can have as much fun as possible sometimes kids will come up with ideas like loops and functions on their own and they should definitely be commended but you don't need to go into it right then wait till they come back and they've got their sun catcher going and then you can say hey guess what we just learned okay so you guys understand now that you're going to take all of these instructions and you can fit this whole thing of instructions right into one line on your program just by calling the name of all of this and that is called a function in computer science we write functions all the time so we can take lots of instructions and call it at different points in a program really really easily another thing i bet you didn't notice is that these change right you have black beads and you have red beads and we don't know what kind of spacer you're going to have or what your special bead is going to be but we need something to put there anyway so that you know what instructions to follow before you even get your cup of beats and that's why we have these placeholder words and we call those variables so you guys just learned by making these little sun catchers how to use functions and variables pretty cool huh
