Usually programming is all in text but we'll use Blockly which uses visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs. Under the hood, you're still creating code. To start off, we're going to build code for a program that will help this Angry Bird move through a maze to get to the evil pigs that stole its eggs. Blockly is split into three main parts. On the left is the bird's maze, where your program will run. The instructions for each level are written below the maze. This middle area is the toolbox and each of these blocks is a command that the bird can understand. The white space on the right is called the workspace and this is where we'll build our program. If I drag the move block to our work space and press "run", what happens? The bird moves forward one box on the grid. And what if I want the bird to do something after it moves forward one box? I can add another block to our program. I'm going to choose the "turn right" block and I'll drag it under my move block until the yellow arrow appears. Then I'll drop it and the two blocks will snap together. When I press "run" again, the bird will perform the commands that are stacked from top to bottom on our work space. If you ever want to delete a block, just remove it from the stack and drag it to the trash can. After you've hit run, you can always hit the reset button to get the bird back to the start. Now let's get those pigs!
