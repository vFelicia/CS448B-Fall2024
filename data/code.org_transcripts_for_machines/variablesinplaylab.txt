a variable is a container that you can store a value in when you use that variable in an algorithm it opens up the container and looks at the value inside this lets you write smarter algorithms that behave differently depending on the values stored in the variable for example if you wanted to write an algorithm to say happy birthday you're turning 10 to my little brother that's great now but when i run it next year i'd wanted to say happy birthday you're turning 11. i could create a variable called age store my brother's age and write my algorithm and say happy birthday you're turning age instead because variables can change each year i can update the variable age to equal age plus one now you're going to try a play lab where you're given different games and you can change the values of variables like speed height score in order to change the game you won't have to change the algorithm of the game to change how it plays just the variable in my work for kindle and on xray for books we apply variables in many different ways one way that you can use a variable is to store page numbers of a book a user can increase and decrease the size of the font in the page based on the font size the number of pages in the book can change we can adjust it by storing the page numbers in a variable
