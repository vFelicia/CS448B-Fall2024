so that's the basics of rgb color now of course you're asking how can i make more and different colors well the answer is that we must use more bits per pixel let's get rid of the image data we just created and then change the image to be 4 pixels by 4 pixels and 6 bits per pixel now let's try to make a red pixel by turning on just the red light since i have 6 bits per pixel here that means that i have 2 bits to set each of the red green and blue light so that means the amount of red light is now a 2bit setting instead of a single bit setting like the last time the largest 2bit number i can make is one one so let me try that red on one one green off zero zero blue off zero zero hey look it's our old friend the red pixel now comes the fun part since the red light of the rgb value has four possible settings let's try each of them out and put the pixels next to each other to see the differences now let's add more pixels with different amounts of red we've got red at one one let's do the next one one zero for red then zeros for green and blue now how about zero one for red followed by zeros for green and blue and finally zero zero oh that's just black again makes sense so with a two bit setting for red it means i can set the brightness of the red light to 4 different levels which are different shades of red to make more colors you just continue to mix different intensities of red green and blue light why don't you try some color mixes 6 bits per pixel can you make your favorite color
