let's say we're building houses we'll use a blueprint that details the attributes of the house like how many rooms and what it's made of the blueprint also has instructions for how to assemble each part of the house in java we have classes each class contains a list of attributes and instructions for how to create an instance of itself an attribute is a characteristic of an object classes can also define the behaviors for an object a behavior is an action that an object can perform these classes are like blueprints for creating objects an object is an instance of the class it has specific values for its attributes each house we build from the blueprint is an instance of the architect's design so each object we create is an instance of the class as we build each house we are instantiating house objects to instantiate is to call the constructor to create an object the constructor is a block of code that has the same name as the class and tells the computer how to create a new object before we can build a house we have to designate land to build it on in java we don't have land we have memory space in this case we need to designate memory space and label it for a house object then we give a name for the object this name is called a reference variable a reference variable is a variable that points to an object think of the reference variable like a street address next we instantiate a house object for the reference variable to point to like building a house at an address we use the new keyword to indicate that we want to instantiate the new object then we indicate the type of object we want to create to get the instructions for creating our house object we call its constructor using empty parentheses i can make a house for my friend or one from my parents or as many other houses as i want each of these houses will have their own set of attributes based on the house class the values of these attributes represent the state of the house the state of an object refers to the attributes represented by the object's instance variables now we can instantiate all the objects we want from the classes we develop
