Now we're going to learn about something all game programmers use everyday. They're called events. An event tells your program to listen for when something happens and then when it does, the game performs an action. Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click or an up or down arrow key or even a tap on the screen. Here, we're going to make the actor say something when the player clicks on it. We will use the when clicked block and attach the say block to it. When the player clicks, all the blocks attached to this block will be performed. There are also when arrow blocks. If you link move blocks to those, you can start to move your actors up, down, left, right, with the arrow keys. Little by little your game is getting more interactive.
