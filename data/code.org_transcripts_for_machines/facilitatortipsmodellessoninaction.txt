we're about to see a model lesson from the deep dive workshop as a reminder the intent of this model lesson is to really give teachers space to see and feel what lessons can look like in their own classrooms that's why we do a role play activity instead of having folks stay in their teacher role we ask them to be in the learner role and the lesson you're about to see is really going to leverage the pair programming feature so look out for that all right everybody before we get into the curriculum and start actually doing a lesson as learners we're going to take ourselves into the position of your students by looking at a few student profiles so you see here we have five student profiles five descriptions of students i'm going to give you a moment to read these and as you read i want you to reflect on whether or not you see any of your own students in these profiles and further i'd like you to think about what your role in responsibility is as a teacher in supporting these student needs take a few minutes to read and reflect and then we'll come back together i definitely see student number four in my classroom uh we focus a lot on collaboration and so it's nice having students who are always eager to work with other uh work with other students and support them in their learning yeah i think the challenge though is when you have those students who just want to blurt out the answer to everyone because they're so proud that they know it and they want to share their knowledge pacing them when you have other students who are still trying to work through things is definitely a challenge absolutely so in the past couple years of teaching this course i certainly have seen a lot of student number threes in my classrooms um they're certainly very engaged early on but as the lessons is a little bit more difficult they um get really discouraged and aren't as persistent as i'd like them to be and they work through all the hints that are provided in each puzzle but after they run out of hints then they give up entirely i'm trying to get past that i see student number one a lot we have a really big disparity in my class some kids are doing a ton of this at home and then they come in and they already know everything and they really are excited to share but then they get ahead of everyone else and they can sometimes get bored when i'm trying to pace it appropriately for the rest of the kids and it makes the kids who aren't doing at home maybe don't even have access to computers at home makes them feel behind and then it's it creates a bad dynamic in the class so i'm still figuring out how to deal with like engaging those students who are really ahead and excited because i don't want them to feel like they're doing something wrong but also making sure that they're not kind of like taking all my attention for sure that was a really great discussion about the students that you're seeing in your classroom and how that relates to the support that we need to provide as teachers i want you to keep those profiles in your mind and think about how you can channel the needs of those students as we move into our model lesson so this is a roleplaying activity where i am going to be acting as the teacher and you are going to be acting as learners you are putting on what we call your learner hat i'm going to put on my teacher hat and you're going to notice that i sort of slip into a mode of talking to you like you're my students it's not because i don't respect you it's because we're doing a role play activity where you are going to act as learners in a classroom any questions about that okay great let me give you some context for the lesson that we're about to do this lesson falls in course d that's meant for third grade students and it's pretty far into the course it's uh lesson number 12. it introduces the concepts of while loops and it uses the farmer in this lesson we are going to be working with one another so you are going to need one computer per two people i'm gonna give you a moment to get that together and when you see my next slide we are all going to be in our role each of you as learners and me as a teacher okay hey everybody welcome back to technology class last time you were here we used a new block in code studio can you raise your hand for me if you remember using this block all right a couple of you remember a couple of you don't that's totally okay we're gonna talk about it a little bit who can tell me in your own words what this what this pink block does in code studio raise your hands please remember yeah right here it helps you do something a bunch of times yeah so it helps you do something multiple times so this block you might remember we called this a repeat block and repeat means we're doing something more than once and who remembers where the question marks are right now what can we put in there numbers right yeah we can put numbers in here so we use this block when we want to do something a certain number of times make sense all right today we are going to start off using that block again and we're going to build to the next kind of block that lets us repeat in order to do our task we're going to be working on two of our computational practices the first one we're going to work on is creativity coming up with unique solutions all of your own and the second is collaboration so that's working with another person to solve problems that's what computational practices we'll be using today in order to do these tasks we're going to pair program how many of you remember pair programming most of you awesome awesome just a quick recap because you've been away from technology class for a little bit when we pair program we each take a role and we take turns in our role so someone is the driver that means somebody is using the keyboard and mouse and someone is the navigator so that's the person who's keeping track of everything we're doing and giving instructions to the person in the driver's seat today we're gonna switch roles every two minutes and i've got a timer up here that's going to go off when it's time to switch does that sound good all right so let's go ahead and get started i need one computer per two people i know you grab them from the laptop cart on your way in so open up your computer one per two people go to code.org the website and in the top right corner where you see your name i want you to click and then select pair programming once you're there you're going to pick my class and then choose your partner whoever you're working with pick their name from the list can you give me a big thumbs up when you're connected to your partner awesome okay your task for right now is to go to course d that's the course on the code.org website that we've been working through today we're on lesson 12 and you are going to get started by practicing with the first three bubbles all i want you to do is the first three bubbles and you're gonna take turns pair programming go ahead and get started so we need to use the repeat block to take advantage of just one but not five right yes one two once we're there after we walk at the end yes awesome job everybody with the first three bubbles here in this lesson i want to take a minute and recap what you just did in these activities you always knew how much dirt you needed to move how did you know how much dirt needed to be moved yeah it showed you the number right you are either taking away or adding a known amount of dirt every time i have a question for everybody what would you need to be able to do in order to do the same exercise if you didn't know how much dirt needed to move how would you solve that problem could you use a repeat block until it's done yeah so that's a super different way of using it right up to now when we use the repeat block we've done it a certain number of times but instead of saying dig 10 times we want to say shovel until there isn't any dirt left right dig until it's done so this is introducing a new type of loop a new block we're going to watch this video to learn more about how this block works and then you're going to get back on your computer and you're going to use it for yourself all right now that we know more about how while loops work you're going to go back on your computer still with your partner you're going to pair program to use this block sound good awesome job today everybody mrs smith is here now so you're going to head back to her class but i'll see you back here next week where we're going to keep going with while loops all right everybody hats are off time to talk pair programming show of hands how many of you have used pair programming the tool in your classroom with your students all right a couple but not everybody we're going to take some time right now to look at how pair programming shakes out in your teacher dashboard so you're going to notice on the screen here that when we pair program the icon changes just from like a single person or number to this like cluster of students this is how i as the teacher know that students completed this level with the pair programming feature turned on i want you to take a moment now to go to your computers if you weren't programming uh on your machine open your machine up as well and i want you to look at how your dashboard looks now that you've completed this lesson with a partner via pair programming we're going to take a couple minutes to do that and then come back and talk questions so that was the model lesson from the deep dive workshop we hope that seeing that gives you some context for how it actually looks to model a lesson and to talk to teachers as though they're students in that role playing context and gives you a little bit more detail about how we think the pair programming feature comes out in the lesson you
