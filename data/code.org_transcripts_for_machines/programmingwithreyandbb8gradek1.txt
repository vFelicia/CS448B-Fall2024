Rey needs BB8's help! In these puzzles you'll program BB8 using the arrow blocks from the toolbox. BB8 needs to pick up each piece of scrap metal to finish the puzzle. First work to find a path for BB8 that covers all the pieces of scrap metal. Then write the program in your workspace to move BB8 on that path. You don't need a special command to pick up scrap metal. BB8 will collect it just by moving over the top. Now let's get rolling!
