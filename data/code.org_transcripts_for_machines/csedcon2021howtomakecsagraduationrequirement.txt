hello good afternoon everybody testing check one two uh i don't think security if you just really want to use it there's an adapter hello everyone uh welcome uh good morning and thank you for being here um if you're here you're probably interested in how you can make computer science graduation requirement um and uh now i'd also like to welcome everyone who's joining us virtually thank you as well and without further ado please remember to check in if you are at a table you have your scanner there and i am going to turn it over to seth gerson we have a panel of great people here today to talk us through graduation requirements so without further ado welcoming seth gerson of the national governors association well thank you maggie and good afternoon good morning everyone depending on your geographic location like maggie said i'm seth gerson program director for k12 education at the national governors association and it's great to be with all of you today i like the excitement from the start i'm just going to provide a bit of background on how governors approach computer science education and how governor hutchinson plans to engage governors on this issue as part of his chairs initiative over the next year or so first just a little bit about the national governors association our membership are there governors in all 50 states and five territories and we support governors primarily by providing a bipartisan safe space a safe forum there we go a safe forum for governors to connect with each other to exchange ideas and share promising practices strategies they're using challenges they're facing it's an opportunity for them to share what's working and what's not in their states across party and state lines and there's a spirit of bipartisanship that infuses all of our work and that starts with our leadership which is always a current republican governor and a current democratic governor with our current chair being governor isa hutchinson of arkansas and fresh off his reelection this week our vice chair governor phil murphy of new jersey and as you can see on the slide we've been doing this for a long time we have a long tradition of doing so the national governors association began in 1908 back then teddy roosevelt himself a former governor of new york was president and he invited governors from across the country to washington dc to know to what we now know is one of his legacy issues on conservation president roosevelt knew that if he was going to move forward on this initiative he would need the support of governors well governors enjoyed meeting so much those two three days the sharing of best practices the knowledge that was being built across states they decided we should really have an organization that regularly brings us together on a bipartisan basis to discuss policy issues so more than 110 years later here we are the national governors association now every july a new nga chair and vice chair are named and each year the nga chair selects an initiative that can engage and convene a cross section of bipartisan governors from across the country recent nga chairs initiatives have focused on job training cyber security energy health care and infrastructure and so this year to the unlikely surprise of probably anyone in this room or online governor hutchinson chose to focus on k12 computer science education as his chair is initiative over the next year an issue that i know anthony will go into deeper in the next few minutes but as you know has been a central focus of his two terms in office and that he ran on in both his election 2014 and his reelection in 2018. now governors tend to approach computer science education in three ways first with a focus on providing a pathway to critical computing occupations including in the areas of cyber security ai robotics and data science a focus on computer science education as a key to economic growth and competitiveness innovation national security and a strong workforce second governors also approached the issue around the importance of computer science education as a foundational set of skills that all students need to succeed in today's workforce things like creativity solving critical thinking data analysis troubleshooting third and hottie touched on this yesterday in the opening plenary we've seen the pandemic bring new attention to this issue governors have worked throughout the pandemic to close the digital divide expand broadband and devices internet access and connectivity for millions of students teachers and families ninety percent and again hottie pointed this out yet ninety percent of middle and high school students now have devices up from 66 pre pandemic and just last month the news magazine axios was out with a survey that showed that 50 percent of teachers are more confident using technology to engage students than before the pandemic as the washington post put it teachers are finding pandemic tech has changed their jobs forever so that's a significant change and it provides a springboard for expanding student access to computer science education and laying a strong foundation for increasing students overall digital illiteracy in terms of the specifics of the timeline for the chairs initiative since july when governor hutchinson became chair and announced the focus of his initiative nga has held a roundtable with industry leaders in july a convening of bipartisan governors in denver in august the launch of a new website and resource bank for the initiative on the nga website nga.org backslash computer science it's on the slide there as well in september and a public launch event of the initiative at the national press club in washington d.c in october from here we plan to engage governors throughout winter and spring 2022 with a dedicated session on computer science education at our annual winter meeting in january 2022 that typically draws between 40 and 45 governors and then we'll have regional convenings of governors and their staff in bentonville arkansas in march 2022 and boston massachusetts in may 2022 at the winner meeting we plan to introduce a draft compact or consensus statement for governors to sign on to committing to expanding access for computerized science education in their states which will then be unveiled at the summer meeting using the momentum of the regional convenings to secure signatures and drive governor interest and engagement and lastly there are five goals of the initiative all of which are on the nga site and this slide number one to increase the number of high schools offering computer science classes number two to increase the number of governors in the govs for cs coalition right now there's 14 governors so upping that number to increase the amount of state funding for computer science education is number three upping from the 65 million dollars dedicated last year number four to increase the number of states requiring at least one computer science education credit for high school graduation main topic of this this session and to increase the diversity number five of students participating in computer science education to address the inequities and gaps in access for girls students of color and students with disabilities among a number of other groups so luckily we have two states with us today that have made progress and are leaders in all of these areas so i'm going to end there and pass it back to maggie anthony and angel to illustrate the strategies that a state can use to reach these goals thank you thank you seth uh and speaking of arkansas it's a perfect time to turn it over to anthony owen of the arkansas department of education who will talk a little bit more about their programs okay thank you maggie and thanks seth and i think i speak on behalf of i think i can speak on behalf of the governor's office in this and just say that we appreciate the amplification that nga has given to arkansas initiative and governor hutchinson's passion in this space uh using y'all's platform so thank you all for doing that so when we were asked to kind of plan for this session we were asked to think about what information information we would like to share and you know in the over the past day and a half we've heard from even hotty year stay talking about the graduation requirement and some of the apprehension around that requirement and i think what states need to take away from before they look at doing this is that they really have to think strategically about this this is not something that if your state is just now getting into the cs education space as an emphasis that you all should really be focused on in my opinion uh i think that's something that you can have as an end goal but it's or a goal at some point down the road but you have to set up the foundation you have to set up that that structure in place arkansas you know we've been leading the nation since 2015 pretty much in this space uh because of the work that we've been doing the meaningful and fastpaced work and it took us six years to look at implemented trying to implement a graduation requirement even while we were leading but during those six years we were strategically looking at things like our teachers how many teachers do you have out there able to teach these courses there's no reason trying to implement a graduation mandate if you don't have those those individuals in place with the skills that they need to reach the students and the communities the training it's not just getting teachers certified because just because someone is certified in a particular subject area doesn't mean that they're ready to teach to the level that our students need and our communities need in our industry need the standards standards arkansas we've been through two full revisions of our computer science standards in the six years of this initiative we had a 20 we did our first revision in 2017 we finished our our second revision 2020 and our new courses came online this fall so we've really given some thought to that with industry partners within the room we've been very blessed in arkansas to have adequate funding and probably more than adequate funding some people would say but i think that the funding has went to good use which is uh you know evident in our programs but the first biennium we were the governor was gracious enough to put 5 million of his rainy day funding funding into the first biennium we worked to get legislation in place that put 2.5 for the next you know each year for the next four years and then most recently starting with this fiscal year that budget has been up through our legislative appropriation as a line item to 3.5 million per year so we continue we continue to see funding support my cs specialist team i don't see any of them in here which i was going to you know recognize them but maybe they've ran away so uh but anyway they are here they have on matching shirts to me we have uh about half our team here we have 10 statewide computer science specialists that are part of my team that we have provided training to over half of our certified teachers in arkansas so thousands of hours of training which has grown not only our high school certified teachers from under 50 to right around 600 currently but we have other trainings that are advanced level we have k8 level trainings including our lead teacher we've heard a lot about integrating within that k8 environment well how are you training those teachers it may not be that they're they need full certification but they definitely need some support and then i would be remiss if i didn't again mention governor hutchinson's support you know he has went out and visited uh over 80 schools talking about why computer science is important you know he has made personal phone calls to superintendents that he felt like could be doing a better job in their schools in these in these states so that leadership has has really played a crucial part and and basically you know as as the slide says if states try to implement this before that strong foundation is established what we're seeing that states that try to move too fast that their implementation is going to fail or the outcome goals will have to be adjusted to the point that it's really watered down a watereddown requirement and you know in arkansas we feel that our requirement is um you know high level uh we do allow apcsa and csp and then we have over 50 other courses that will meet this graduation requirement that we've developed uh internally i will tell you apcsp a lot of people that is a good course i agree with that but if you look at the rigor of apcsp compared to our year one courses at high school in arkansas apcsp is actually lower rigor than anything that we wrote at a high school level so it is our lowest rigor course that meets this graduation requirement so you know not only must the state have that strong foundation but you have to have the public support behind it and that's where governor hutchinson's uh focus on this has been so crucial we've put ads in theaters uh going directly to parents a lot of seas rely on trying to send information to schools and then having the schools disseminate that information to their communities we do that also but we're also going directly to parents and students talking about the importance of this and the reason that that it is good for smaller communities especially and families uh building that positivity around it uh through maybe it's bonuses for teachers uh different competitions that we you know elevate in in stature awards for students you know we are state coding competition for high school our our winning team gets two thousand dollars each team member and uh ten thousand dollars to go back to their school's cs program and we give other awards for different levels and then we also have middle school contests and then strategic partnerships at those middle and lower grade levels like our partnership with learning blade which really helps us drive awareness of stem stem opportunities for students we might get into this a little bit later but you know we see this as an economic driver for arkansas it and it needs to be approached that way but it can't just be another another academic requirement that's placed on schools and students there has to be a reason behind it and the reason is that that our students are going to need these skills to get into those jobs in the fourth technological revolution or industrial revolution if you have this foundation in place if you have these key components in place then the supporting legislation for the mandate can come we wanted to do it through legislation the representative body we could have done it through regulation but we wanted to go to our legislature because if we can't convince our legislature our legislators that this is good as representatives of our communities and we did it via regulatory body then there's going to be more pushback because it is not reflective of the community and what their desires are so i've shared some links on this slide to our strategic plan if you're going to think strategically i invite you to go out and look at our plan there are actually a couple of states i think took our strategic plan search for arkansas and plugged their state name in it that's fine we're okay with that and then really this work couldn't have driven or been driven to work has been without the work of our two task force uh act 187 which set up our mandate that every high school had to offer a cs course back in 2015 also established our first task force on this and a lot of their recommendations are what have driven our strategic planning over the past four years in 2020 we brought in a second task force a governor's level task force on this and they not only reviewed what we had done from the previous task force recommendations but then made new recommendations for moving forward and we looked at we looked at those recommendations for our standards revision or our legislation and really how my office moves forward as we push this initiative so i'm going to leave leave you with two quotes before i hand it back to maggie here and angel jack welch is kind of a hero of mine just his business based mindset and this quote has always kind of spoken to me in our initiative when launching something new you have to go for it playing not to lose can never be an option and that fits right in with my team's motto which is no excuses only results and that's what we try to press amongst all our schools and then this one i always kind of find funny and remind my team of it if plan a doesn't work remember the alphabet has 25 more letters so maggie thank you so much anthony um and last but certainly not least angel malone here from the south carolina department of education angel so good morning good afternoon to everyone here in the audience and online uh thank you for just coming to hear about what has been done thus far excited about the work with anthony with arkansas and seth with nga and i'm just here to kind of close it out to show you what south carolina has done i am the career and technical education director for the state department of education and i'm excited to share with you what south carolina has done to make that happen um we started out with looking at our vision for career and technical education by ensuring that we prepare students for workforce and as anthony has shared there has to be that north star or that y for what you're doing so that you can always point towards that so for us we want to ensure that students are empowered to understand k through 12 in k12 computer science and also computational thinking and we think that with that our mission is that cs is key that we kindle that fire or or that awareness for computer science that we ensure that we look through the lens of equity that we are touching all populations all demographics across our state because it is vast and that it requires the input of everyone of you of being a part of that and being in partnership and that is because from the time that you wake up until the time that you go to sleep you are computing you are engaging with computer science whether you want to or not and we had a joke in our last session i said my sister asked me why don't i have an apple watch and i said because i don't want to be surveilled and she said that is so hypocritical cool because you have an iphone and you interact with everything and so i say that because we need to ensure that we prepare students not only as consumers but also creators and architects of what engaging with computer science has to offer for our world globally and that they are competitively advantaged and so we did that by implementing computer science through various levers and that is number one to create that awareness so students parents all shareholders are are knowledgeable of of the aspects of computer science as well as the benefits we also wanted to ensure that we had strategic partnerships with various wraparound services understanding that it cannot happen within that k12 realm alone that it has to happen outside of school and also providing those onramps into postsecondary opportunities and for people who are engaged in getting back into the workforce and need additional education we also wanted to ensure that we built the infrastructure appropriately for teachers to build their capacity and to have credentialing opportunities and to make that as i heard someone say yesterday as an interstate not just as a road map or a highway but to ensure there were many opportunities for teachers to be able to get the support that they need we're excited about that we were able to provide credentialing opportunities through work based learning so those experts in the field that are coming from industry we have that opportunity for them to be a part of it and to train our students as well as our teachers who are already certified providing opportunities for them to have full computer science certification through testing or by also a microcredentialing program that we're piloting this year to ensure that there are those opportunities in all areas across our state especially those very very rural ones that we can have a depth of knowledge in computer science and it's just not those introductory courses but those advanced courses that will give our students the greatest competitive advantage and so we wanted to also make sure that there was legislative backing and funding so as anthony said not just the regulatory piece where we're putting that there for for schools to follow by having that computer science graduation credit of which we think it's very important and i'll share that with you as well but also have the legislative backing and funding of the importance of it and how we did that was by ensuring that we looked at workforce to do that that's what was important for us so and i'm sorry i'm navigating between this screen and that screen so we started out by ensuring that there was a certification process that we identified that this is something of importance and that teachers had a way to quantify their knowledge by having a certification we then implemented the k through 8 computer science standards and then followed behind with that the 9 through 12 computer science standards we have at linkedin here our strategic plan so you can kind of see what our mindset was and i think that is very important as you look at broadening the participation and implementing a high school graduation credit i will say that this is one of the ways it's hardy said they they haven't they're in the wait and see mode to see if this kind of works to have that grad credit but here's what i know computer science is the equalizer for people from all socioeconomic backgrounds and i understand that with a specific amount of skill set that a student who is um in in a place of poverty can literally change the trajectory of their family not just themselves but the generation that follows them by being a part of computer science gaining that skill set and being able to go on a job get paid while they continue learning and so it's very important that we have that as a requirement because number one students have to engage with computer science and computational thinking from the time they get up you know that child that's four years old knows how to say alexa turn on peppa pig right they know how to do that right and so we want to ensure that not only can they engage and be the consumer but they are also the creators and the architects of it and can change it globally and be competitive so the bill that we got passed thankfully last year was age 3612 and one of the things that i am so grateful that it allows us to do is to employ a cs supervisor dominique sanders who is in the room um and is also a cs equity fellow we also uh have the creation of a statewide plan and i wanted to share this that this is implemented now for us to create a statewide plan i wanted to be very transparent to say we didn't have a plan when we started but we now rank up there with arkansas so far as brought in participation and i say that because you need to start wherever you are look at what the emphasis is for your state look at what your governor is focusing on and align with those things and start wherever you can we also are hiring four regional coaches for computer science so if you know of any send them our way so we can get the best out there for implementation across the board for all areas and then designing career pathways as well as other professional development opportunities i'm grateful for the partnership that we have with csta we're able to work with our teachers to provide training last year we provided training for over 200 teachers this year it was over 330 teachers so we're able to grow that by leaps and bounds and get teachers to have endorsements as well as opportunities just to increase their knowledge about computer science and share that with students and so if i could give you any implementation advice it would be first of all conduct a needs assessment and look at your labor market to demand so i know that there's that issue of oh goodness we don't want to focus so much on the workforce but i think you have to have a why and we want all of our students to not only be great citizens but we want them to be responsible enough to be able to take care of themselves and their family this is the way that we do that to increase that access and then create awareness with all of the shareholders looking at the various vantage points and speaking to them from those particular aspects what i thought was amazing yesterday was the the algorithm video for younger students to show them how what you pick online everyone is cataloging your interest and creating those choices that you can look at so being able to share those parts of computer science and engaging with students that way and then building and developing that strategic plan as well as the infrastructure to make it happen there has to be ease of access with doing that with the user in mind so i will remind you of this we have made many uh steps along the way had to start over turn back around and all these different things just go for it uh author is angel malone with the understanding that it is there's not a perfect plan it's just you need to start where you are align yourself and continue to move don't stop thanks thank you so much angel that was fantastic let's give it up for our panel um so angel anthony um you both have had really good systems in place you have a really good foundation computer science is clearly important in your states uh before you actually went for this graduation requirement so what kind of pushback did you receive who who was pushing back against making graduation requirement was anybody oh goodness well so everyone who thinks that especially during the pandemic we are not doing as well in english and math right so this must be the emphasis and so we did have pushback there so far as what what does core instruction look like what are we taking away from students and i don't think that it is about taking away from them it's about sharing with your shareholders the both and the necessity of integrating computer science into everything and i'm so excited about the hour of code this year where cs is everywhere so we can show that it's in everything and that regardless of whether we want it to be or not it's going to be a part of our life and daily routine routine and to really share with workforce demand the workforce demand that we have in our state and also having residents to understand that we not only want you to be the consumer we want you to be the creators and the art architects so not only are you defining your journey but you are also becoming globally competitive to to orchestrate what's going to be used nationally so and you know i kind of want to piggyback on a little bit of that you know the yesterday we we heard the comments about that some and especially in the international panel and i greatly appreciate the perspective that they they brought but you know we heard that there were countries that were worried about these instruction in the core areas not being where they should be and they needed to correct that before they started focusing on something like cs my my team and i were talking about that last night as we were sitting around in the reception or after the reception and um you know i made the statement of what are they going to do differently okay if they haven't been getting the core instruction correct for the past how many ever decades what are they changing and that's really where cs and computing comes in is that that gives our students a relevant reason to learn many of those concepts we know that computational thinking is a mathematic skill we know that problem solving is a mathematics skill we know that all the pieces of a well thought out set of standards for a cs course are going to build upon those skills needed for mathematics sciences and and even to a certain extent the the english language arts and the ability to communicate uh effectively so we in education we talk all the time about making education relevant and that it means something to our students but then when we talk about just focusing on these areas without the application or the reason for it we're stepping backwards now back to maggie's question just briefly she asked about some pushback that we received and i mean you're going to get it you know as i said this morning when we were kind of discussing some of this stuff i said in education any change is always going to receive some sort of pushback from somebody because of those two words that i hate which are we've always okay don't say weave always to me because you're about to get unloaded on okay so um i don't like those words um those those should be curse words and education um so but anyway of course we had pushback we also had some pushback from a legislator legislators as we were trying to work this through the process and it wasn't negative but i had one legislator in in particular that that during the committee won the committee meetings brought up well why computer science why should we mandate computer science why should it not be construction why should it not be welding and he named off about three different things well i was prepared for this so um i in fact that just that morning i'd found a notice or a press alert of a company that was investing 40 million dollars in 3d printing of houses and the i don't remember the exact statistics but i had them in front of me at that time i want to say like the something like the reduction in construction costs for an average house was like 60 percent of what it normally was for a house but i know the reduction in waste was over 95 percent by 3d printing these houses so whenever that legislator said what about construction well guess what construction of the future is computer science welding of the future is computer science if you don't believe me go look at some of those cnc robots that are welding we have to have those those are the industrial robots that are welding we have to have the these skills mixed together try to be an auto mechanic today and not understand some computer science so if we want to bring up a generation of students that are ready for this fourth industrial revolution there has to be a relevant set or baseline set skills of computer science and computing so seth division in politics is nothing new even though it's kind of become more prevalent in the last few years with 55 different governors different ideas different personalities different parties uh why do we expect computer science to be something they should all get behind well thanks maggie it's a great question and um i think you know the first place to start is just to say that this has historically been a bipartisan issue you know governors from both parties have traditionally gotten behind computer science education and we don't see that that changing just seeing recent efforts all governors may come at it from different levels of how they want to move forward this this work but at the end of the day they're all focused on building a strong competitive workforce in their states and this is one of those issues of how do you create the pathways for that that strong workforce um and i think you know something that both angel and anthony brought up and and illustrated are the the levers that governors use in this area right in all of education but particularly this area they're using the bully pulpit they're using their convening powers they're using their agenda setting powers to raise public awareness to you know really sort of drive some of these task forces and mechanisms for bringing stakeholders around the table to move the the work forward you know just pointing to a few examples recent examples governor ivy and alabama for instance uh created a couple of different task forces one focused on stem and one interrelated on computer science education to bring again students and educators and parents and families um and k12 and higher education to the table to set out a vision for what this work could be she then had you know annual conferences that brought together some of these stakeholders um and having and something anthony mentioned as well some of these coding competitions to draw students interests and bring public awareness to what are we talking about when we're talking about computer science education making it more tangible for the public and parents and families in new jersey governor murphy facilitated partnerships with three universities to create computer science learning hubs throughout the state and again this focus on not only increasing student access to computer science education but something we've heard throughout this conference the importance of also having that professional learning for teachers to be able to teach at the same time the the the content that's so so critical for this in georgia governor kemp announced a partnership earlier this year between high schools career and technical education programs and industry leaders again focused on that computing occupations pathway that's so so critical for building a strong workforce in their states and i want to go back to something you know and just reemphasize that it's this new opportunity right now this inflection point as hottie called it um that governors are giving another look at where they can expand computer science education where they can increase students digital literacy there's just been so much investment in the device's connectivity access broadband over this time that its governor is looking at not only you know how to harness that but how to make sure that that students and teachers and families just really um make sure that they're they're using it in a way that's effectively and that really creates the ripple effect for building a competitive workforce in their states so i want to go off that point you mentioned workforce a lot and it's been brought up a few times today is there too much of a focus on work and the workforce when it comes to education especially in young grades well i guess i'll start and then sure move forward but i think too many times in education and policy overall we we look at some of the sort of false uh silos or false dichotomies and you know that it doesn't need to be sort of one or the other but it can be be both and certainly as i was saying you know governors are focused first and foremost on big building that strong competitive workforce in their states um and policy certainly works best when there's an alignment a strong alignment between what workforce needs are and the pathways that education is providing for that in a state but governors also understand that you know to keep students engaged throughout their schooling experience they must harness student interests right this goes back to ted sizer's you know famous comment around you know creating places for learning but also places for joy and so if you really you know provide students with those experiences and harness their interests and then always including parents and families communities at that center so that they're involved and engaged in their child's experience that's what will drive them towards the pathway that we're talking about for workforce so it's education and workforce they're not separated they're not siloed and you know harnessing that interest then also keeping your your guide as angel said on the north star of workforce gives you the why and i think it's also you know worth noting going back a little historically we get the question all the time where's the education governors of today people hark back to those 80s and 90s times around governor hunt of north carolina or governor riley of south carolina governor kaine of new jersey governor clinton of arkansas and the the truth is right now in short all governors are education governors um back then it was sort of more of a rare instance for governors to talk about education issues so it was notable but now all governors are focused on education they may come at it more from a workforce side they may come at it more from an education side or more likely both but all governors are talking about education these days and it's how they they talk about it so i'm just going to say ditto what seth said um it is that both end and i know that there's that challenge of individuals who say we focus too much on workforce and what they need in developing that pipeline we need to make sure that students are balanced but i think that we have to normalize that computational thinking is natural and it is something you do from birth until the time you leave and because of that we have to ensure that we are allowing students to engage and understand what they are engaging with so that they can understand that it is the cookies that are tracked that determine their choices and all of those different things but then also empower them to think entrepreneurially as well as um you know being able to go into the workforce in a competitive way so far as becoming again those architect or those the architect are the creators of this information and so it is that both end of creating that balance for them and making them wellrounded citizens but it all it is also about that north star of how do we fulfill workforce demand in things such as global logistics right now with your amazon packages not coming to your house on time or getting the stuff that you need for christmas and so it's those practical things that we have to be concerned about and how do we become globally competitive and it's through the these skill sets that students will be able to do that and navigate onward well and i think we're kind of all saying the same thing here to a certain extent but i'll kind of be the bad guy on the stage to a certain extent coming from industry prior to getting into education i i have a different view of education in our public education system than a lot of traditional educators i view public education as an investment it's an investment in tomorrow's workforce and whenever we approach policies when we approach implementation when we approach where we're putting our priorities our funding our resources if we can't draw a direct return on investment plan based on those those interjections are based on those resources then we really should step back and say as an educational community is this where we should be placing our resources now that's not to say i don't value things like the arts my son is incompetent my eldest son is in competitive band he loves that he also loves computer science not just because i tell him he has to but because he actually loves it but we need these other things kind of like seth alluded to to sometimes keep students interested beyond those those other things but that again is a workforce reason that is a reason because we want our kids engaged in school we want them going to school regularly we want them to have a reason to not get in trouble and get suspended which might be that they don't want to get dropped out of competitive band but they have to be there to learn these other skills and if we're not looking at education as an investment and the resources we're putting into it as a future investment in our future workforce why are we doing it thank you all i want to turn it over to the audience and uh open it up to questions so any questions for our wonderful panel did i just speak loudly is that okay yeah i'll repeat it so my question is around standalone computer science courses versus integrated computer science courses and so both states i believe have that graduation requirement within that requirement does it allow for both or is it more standalone computer science courses that are required so does the for the people watching at home uh does the graduation requirement include integrated computer science courses or standalone computer science courses so for the graduation requirement we have developed over 60 courses and they are standalone courses but they're in things like data science robotics the our year one courses when we wrote those in this last iteration we really looked at what would be all skills that all students who are entering the workforce if that was the minimum level of computing and computer science skills that they had what would be that minimum skill set that that industry would need but on the other flip side of this and we're not talking about this today in this panel but i'll mention we also require all of our students to engage in computer science at the k8 environment and guess what it is embedded or integrated throughout our k8 environment so we approach it from a bo both standpoint but in arkansas we do believe that once you get to that high school level if you've built that integration throughout those k levels properly then you need to start looking at what are those specialized areas that those students may focus on whether it be programming like most most computer people think is computer science or data science or computer engineering or robotics or cyber security or networking so we've developed nine state pathways that are centered around those those different threads and artificial intelligence and machine learning i leave that one out i forget about it all the time because it's one of our newest ones but we we have pathways of three courses that do specialize and we do require that siloed if you want to call it course but that course is built around competencies that every student should have yeah and just to to add to that you have to have that define that definition for computer science or else your graduation requirement is going to be something that is deluded and so yeah on the k through eight side there is that integration to show how it fits with everything but just as um if you're getting direction somewhere there are multiple ways to get there once you get to your specific place there's a defined path to to get to that location and so the computer science grad courses there are arranged from introduction or introductory courses onto those highly specialized courses that can count with a specific definition so what does every child need to know when they're going through a particular course and then what do they need for these specific areas we have done that and scaled that out so when that student continues on and cr and and increases their depth of knowledge in computer science they have a specific skill set i will say selfishly that is to prepare them for workforce right um and so it is to ensure that when they leave they have that competitive advantage and i think if we're not doing that then why are we doing what we're doing were there any certification issues you ran into with implementing the graduation requirement before or after okay good good angel so i was going to say we did identify a certification area prior to implementing the standards that was done first so we had that support in place however we didn't we couldn't find the teachers that wanted to to do what they needed to do right to get that certification it's hard that's this hard and so after engaging in that and and and then seeing the gaps we then began to create opportunities for endorsements so not necessarily certification a full cert but endorsement to teach the introductory courses right with specific training that we we identified and provided for was able to provide a stipend for teachers to do that as well in addition creating those areas and avenues for work base those individuals coming from industry to be able to teach courses and then most recently adding on a micro credentialing piece as a pilot to show how you can get the certification or the full cert with specialized knowledge in a particular area through demonstration and not necessarily on a test and as a former teacher i appreciate when someone can demonstrate by passing a test but if you can show me that you can teach that to a child that's i appreciate that more that's more beneficial and i'm just going to say it really is an ongoing process no matter how strong a foundation you you build in arkansas we did build a strong foundation i mentioned this in the last session that one of the first things we did in this initiative is we identified a clear pathway to licensure why is it in some states it's very clear how you become a secondary math teacher but it automatically gets confusing when we start talking about cs why is there not a clear pathway so we established that in arkansas early on so teachers could understand and guess what we went from under 50 teachers that we could identify with some type of credentialing to teach computer science which was ap csa back then to we're right at 600 certified teachers in arkansas in a period of about six years so it can be done there has to be support mechanisms in place there has to be resources there to to drive reasoning for that and but there also has to be a clear sequencing for teachers to follow teachers want to do this a lot of teachers want to do this they just don't want to jump through a lot of hoops that don't have a clearly defined pathway or they don't see a reason for it so we've really made that process i won't say easy in arkansas it's not easy but it is clear any other questions all right well i have another one for you both um arkansas south carolina 90 of high schools are offering computer science nine yes ninety two come on [Laughter] all right so why uh why a graduation requirement you already have uh the vast majority of your schools offering computer science well i'll kind of turn that back around on a question back to you why do we require algebra for a graduation for every student even though all of our schools are teaching algebra okay it's really it's it's it comes down to this idea that at some point in history within each of our states there was some regulatory or legislative body that said algebra is a critical component for every student to have before they leave our high schools english one two three four in our state for example is a critical component that every student that they must have before they leave high school at some point there was some regulatory or legislative body that said this is important for our future workforce to have arkansas said you know what we've been doing computer science as an option for six years we built this foundation it is now time for us as a state us as a legislative body or them as a legislative body and the governor to say it is our time in history to say this is a critical critical component or knowledge set that every one of our students should have before they enter in workforce so you know it it goes back to it is a natural progression of what education looks like i started this by saying the two words that i hate we've always in education we have to stop the weave always we have to start the what do we need to do and so why acs grad requirement thank you anthony because my answer is why not why not a cs grad requirement because we don't have that option of whether or not we engage with the things that require cs and so if we don't have that option then we can't afford for that to be an option for our students who are going to be going into the workforce so you say why i say why not typical educators ask us a question we're going to ask you a question back that's it all right um and oh yes uh when should the computer science community lean into requiring computer science for graduation so i'm going to say now but i say that with caution you have to create the awareness first right and i think that in any requirement there has to be the transition so you have to have a long runway so that people can feel supported and that you have done what is necessary to build the infrastructure so that you can get there so the thing is getting there right once you get there creating another goal to go further you cannot give directions to a particular place and say drive in your car and go there if you have not provided the roadway or the infrastructure for you to be able to get there so i think it's about creating the access and then going beyond access to engagement and before you can do all of that you must have awareness so now is the time i think we're already too late however when you are doing that create that awareness with your shareholders first and the north star being workforce and i would say you know knowing i advise a lot of states on their strategic planning i think last count i'm up to like 27 of helping them with their strategic planning for the cs initiative and i know code.org's perspective on this they have to look at what can be done or what should they recommend what should they put their resources behind in getting states who make to see equity in computer science to build that that capacity for all cameron my response to that question honestly would be i don't see that right now the graduation requirement is a foundational piece to computer science it is a stretch goal it is something that states should be building to attain in the future at some point if they're not ready for it so if you look at the nine policy suggestions for cs we agree as a community they're all foundational but why do we have to try to pigeonhole the graduation requirement or these other pieces into 10 suggestions why not look at we have these nine foundational suggestions that code.org is still going to continue to place a lot of emphasis and support behind but knowing that we have these some marketing person can come with a much better term than i can but we have these stretch goals that every state should be looking at why are we building these foundation pieces and what can eventually happen yeah but i agree with angel 100 now is the time to start as a state thinking about how you're going to get to that down the road thank you um so as we wrap up i'd like to leave everyone with some final thoughts uh from you all so what is something uh briefly what is something you've learned what is something you do differently or what is something you wish you knew or what is just something you think the group should know seth i'm going to put you on the spot and make you go first well i think um you know the the main thing even just coming off of yesterday that is so critically important and we'll make sure to engage governors on is i think that international panel and it comes off something anthony asks of what should uh states as they're thinking about this not do and that is to just only focus on the high school piece but to start in those early grades i think that that report that they were talking about has such you know relevance as to systems that have tried certain things and what has worked and what is not and making sure that as governors are moving forward on their work and within their sake context that they're aware of not only what has worked but what has not in the in the past um and to add to that i'm going to say that yeah the focus can not only be on the high school aspect has to be in the k through 8 realm and it has to be with postsecondary options for me as a woman of color i also would like to see more of a mandate on the diversity in the corporate area so once these students have the hope and the aspiration and they're empowered to move forward where do they have to go where they're represented and they're able to do what is necessary to be globally competitive um and i would i would say something that we've approached this entire building up through is that we place our funding in people okay not programs now that's not to say that we don't have great vendor partners i mentioned learning blade earlier but we take a very close look at how our state dollars are being spent and we spend that as an investment in people because that builds longterm capacity that builds a community person who is the champion of that instead of paying someone a large sum of money to come in and tell you and your people what you should be doing for three years and that funding dries up or they that company gets into something else and they leave the state and they leave this vacuum and everybody's like what happened so place your money in building up your people building up your teachers building up specialists i'm so glad to see that you are going to hire four cs specialists let me know when you get to 10 and don't try to hire any mine away but but put your money into people and and that will be that will be uh beneficial i also want to end because i promised her i'd do it at some point in this this conference i'm usually team katie but today i'm team maggie yes thank you anthony i appreciate that i promise that wasn't planned all right seth angel anthony thank you all so much for being here today this is a fantastic uh insight into what you are all doing in different organizations and different states and different landscapes and thank you all so much for being here and joining us our contact information is on the slide there um please give a round of applause for our fantastic panelists team alexis too you
