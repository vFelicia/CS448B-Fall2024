wow uh so bye so do foreign do two foreign dude i miss you i miss you my the world has some big problems but i'm little what can i do even when problems seem big we can tackle them one step at a time our generation can help make a more prosperous equitable and sustainable world i'm learning to code i'm designing apps that solve local problems i'm programming robots on learning computer science to make change happen because with technology we can build robots to clean the world's oceans we can program drones to detect forest fires quickly we young women with digital skills and tools we can program our mobile apps to streamline farming in poor rural areas we can use gene sequencing to diagnose diseases and create personalized medicine to cure them i'm little but don't look at my size look at my potential i can make change happen i can make change happen i can make change happen i can make change happen welcome everyone to the 2021 computer science education conference cs edcon give yourselves a round of applause feel free to tweet your questions or just comments pictures to atco.org hashtag csedcon my name is pat yarm praddit and you know a lot of things have changed during the last year and a half this particular picture is actually about 10 years old and obviously precovered premask wearing so you know i went to the code.org website and i decided to update it uh you know just kidding that's that's not me that's that's the winter soldier but this is me and and yes i've been working out but all jokes aside we have 270 participants here again give yourselves a round of applause just for making it out go ahead and raise your hand if this is the first inperson conference you've had since covey began wow so it's a wonderful uh time to be here it's a wonderful time in computer science education like i said we have 270 participants from 47 states and 10 countries and given the fact that all of us have been zoomed out over the last year and a half i want you to know that this conference is designed around engagement from the regional networking session we're going to have after this plenary session to the reception later on this evening to the happy hour tomorrow and the strategy sessions on friday we've designed this conference to promote valuable interactions so cs edcon was designed to foster unique interactions to focus and energize the computer science education community and to develop to help you develop new tools and strategies to advance equity in your states your regions and your countries so again thank you for attending cs edcon without further ado i'd like to introduce mrs allison yoshimoto tauri she's going to welcome us to los angeles but first a quick bio about miss mrs yoshimoto towery allison is the chief academic officer of los angeles unified school district she oversees birth to adult education most important to allison is leading from an equity lens and rethinking how business as usual is done to meet the needs of those students and communities historically underserved by public education certainly a mission that we can commiserate with in computer science education mrs allison yoshimoto towery thank you thanks so much so welcome to los angeles everybody so for those of you joining virtually i want you to know there are over 200 and almost 300 people here that are dressed from head to toe in professional clothes quite amazing so it's a blessing to be with you today in person i did want to welcome you to sunny los angeles i know many of you got on planes and are traveling for the first time it's wonderful to be here together i wanted to take you on a little journey but first i wanted to say i'm a mother of two boys we have about a half a million los angeles students sitting in classroom right at this very moment as we're breathing here in this room and they're waiting for the opportunity to for us to do exactly what we're here to talk about my father was an auto mechanic in east los angeles and went to l unified schools and when he started as an auto mechanic it only required a wrench but by the time he finished in his lifetime he needed to understand how to use a computer to fix a car so i'm going to start by from the back from the end and talk forward and in the next few minutes want to build a picture for ourselves if we know already that computing is the number one source of income for our students in the united states and if we know already that girls who take an ap computer science class are 10 times more likely to major in computer science and if we know already that our black and latino students who take ap computer science are seven times more likely to major in computer science and if we know already that students love art and music and computer science and they find more joy in those things in school then we want to make sure that all of our students have those opportunities don't we i want to hear that really loud don't we yes we absolutely do so our challenge today and over the course of this conference is to really think about joy equity and how do we provide that engagement equity and that joy equity that our students deserve every day just like a paper and a piece and a pencil access to computer science to coding is what's going to give them access not necessarily all in computer science industry but that creative innovative thought and that design thinking that students get when they're creating coding when they're it's like riding a bike with the wind flowing through your hair where you know you can steer yourself they get that same feeling when they're learning computer science and how to code that's going to create the new best transportation in this country in this world it's going to create the new fashionista because it's that creative thought right it's going to create the new best way to fix somebody who needs heart surgery because we're we're investing in our young people and the way to think about problems in the world and to create solutions so with that i just want to say thank you for investing thank you for putting everything and being all in with us because this is not just about public education it's about how the private sector offers internships to our students it's about how philanthropy makes up the difference between what students some students get at home and what others don't it's about how our nonprofit world like our amazing partnership with code.org give it up for them leans into public education to support our students and our teachers and our next educators because the way we learned computer science 15 years ago is not the way our students are going to need to be learning at 15 years from now so even today as our students are sitting in class we need to be thinking differently as the grownups in the room so thank you all welcome to la and thank you for blessing us with your presence today and enjoy your conference thank you again allison thank you so let's go over some logistics starting with uh a bitly link that you all actually have access to on your lanyards i don't have a lanyard on me right now but right behind it is a qr code if you use that qr code you can actually connect to our daily digest that daily digest also includes there it is bitly csikon21 that's the bitly link but you can just use a qr code as well in that daily digest you will find a question parking lot and yes so if you have questions you can type those questions into that question parking lot we'll answer them during the plenaries or the breaks we're going to be tweeting at hashtag cs edcon if you need to use the bathroom it's just over to your left over there that's pretty important we've been released from zoom meetings for the next what two two and a half days so let's take the time to engage with one another personally and like i said we've designed this conference around personal interaction additionally cell phone wise please quiet your cell phones during sessions and if you need to connect to the wifi in this area the conference area weston meeting and the password is lowercase cs edcon 2021. now the conference team has worked really hard to make this conference a safe inperson experience and everyone who is here has completed a covid vaccination attestation form thank you for that the local policy here requires us to wear mass at all times indoors unless eating and outside it's recommended but voluntary and so we'll be outside later on for the reception you have these table tents on all of your tables including in this room as well as in the session rooms please uh use that qr code to access our uh contact tracing form so that in the in the case where there might be some medical situation we can uh trace contacts additionally you've all been given the opportunity to wear different colored lanyards depending on your um your just to describe your personal space so starting with the pink one to the yellow one and then the blue one the blue one this uh this okay with hugs and handshakes actually it's been surprising a lot of people are actually okay with hugs and handshakes so much that we actually ran out of those purplish lanyards we had to find another batch so if you had to pick a yellow one and you're actually okay with hugs and handshakes you can go ahead and switch that later on we found another batch lastly we have rapid uh antigen testing in the san diego room uh thursday tomorrow from 3 to 5 pm and then friday at uh from 10 to 12 30. lastly uh the entire schedule is available online at cs edcon dot com schedule there you can create an account add your picture figure out what sessions you want to attend additionally because these sessions are so amazing if you can't attend a session during a particular breakout session slot the slide decks will be uploaded probably about 30 minutes to an hour before that session begins so without further ado i want to introduce our next speakers jake baskin the executive director of the computer science teachers association carol fletcher the principal investigator investigator of the esup alliance and dr katie hendrickson the president of the code.org advocacy coalition let's give them a round of applause good afternoon everyone i am dr katie hendrickson and i am so thrilled to be here with you all to launch the 2021 state of computer science education report this is the fifth annual report which combines information about policies that have been adopted to support computer science education with implementation data on computer science access and opportunity code.org the csta and esep are the coauthors of the report but the real work comes from everybody here in this room and everybody watching on the live stream we thank our corporate partners our nonprofit partners coalition members advocating for computer science the policy makers who are making computer science foundational and all of the teachers and school leaders who are doing this work on the ground so you'll have a copy of this report i'll take you through some of these highlights for the first time finally half of all high schools in the united states offer computer science this is tremendous this is such a milestone that's up from about 35 percent just a few years ago but on the other hand this means that half of all schools still lack access and there are gaps in who has access i live in a rural community in southeastern ohio one of the poorest counties in the state and students there are likely to attend an underresourced school students who attend urban schools rural schools or schools that serve high populations of economically disadvantaged students are less likely to offer computer science we need to start to accelerate the closing of these gaps and how do we do that well one answer is policy we know from this report that policy does matter it makes a difference states that adopt more computer science education policies see a greater percentage of high schools offering computer science this is where we can really make a difference to ensure that every student has access so i'd be remiss if i didn't mention what these nine policies are they're detailed in the report so you can dig in but we've seen incredible growth over the past year 50 policies have been adopted by 31 states this year 21 of those states continued their funding for computer science teacher professional development 65 million dollars this year were allocated by state legislatures prioritizing this that's more than any year previous and this year we also saw our first comprehensive policy adoption where now students in every single state can apply a computer science course towards their high school graduation requirements every single student three states went even further and now require all students to take a computer science course in high school before graduation this has been such a big year for computer science education policy now i'm going to turn over to jake jay can you tell us about what this means for implementation and enrollment in schools absolutely thanks katie and this katie said while we cross that halfway threshold we still know that almost half of all schools still don't offer a single computer science course and we also now know thanks to more detailed data from states that even in places that do offer a course it doesn't necessarily mean that students are taking it or that that opportunity is distributed equally for the first time i'm really thrilled to share that we can report that 4.7 of all high school students enrolled in a foundational computer science course last year that's for all foundational computer science courses not just ap so i want you to take a second and think about what that percentage is for a math class or an english class in your state although this number represents tremendous growth for computer science there's still so many students who are missing out and there are persistently predictable disparities in who's taking these classes we now know that by introducing computer science and elementary grades in environments where all students are learning together we're thrilled to see gender parity and participation in computer science however as we move into middle and high school we see that gender gap widen where there's a a larger gap in participation between males male students and their female and nonbinary peers and as we look at english learners students with disabilities or economically disadvantaged students those gaps persist relative to the overall population of those students in the student body to me these data make it incredibly clear that it's not just about access to computer science it's about what's happening every single day inside of classrooms to ensure that students are walking into equitable and inclusive environments and we need to invest deeply in how we support teachers and develop them throughout their careers to ensure that every student is walking into a welcoming and sustaining computer science environment in fact that's why we specifically call out in the standards for cs teachers that teachers be active advocates for equity and inclusion in their classroom and here at csta we're thrilled to support teachers as they work to create an intentional equity focused vision to improve access engagement and achievement for all of their students in cs and while i'm up here and have the stage i just want to take a second to say an enormous thank you to all of the computer science teachers here in the room and who are watching on the live stream for all of the work that you've been doing it's been probably the most challenging two years imaginable for computer science teachers and teachers everywhere and the wins in this report are thanks to the work that you're doing every day in your classroom so thank you and we also know that teachers operate in larger systems so i'd like to turn it over to carol to share a little bit more about what the report tells us about those environments thank you so um we know that uh csta has done an exceptional job of really providing the supports that teachers need to teach equitably and inclusively in their classrooms but we also know that if we want to scale and sustain the the improvements we've seen in access and participation and evidenced in this report we've also got to address the systems that are producing these equities and in the esep alliance we look at we use a framework called the cape framework to really analyze the entire ecosystem of cs education so we're looking at what is the capacity for equitable cs education where does access and equity intersect what is our uh equitable participation look like and then finally are we giving equitable experiences to students in order to do that work at that systems level however we've got to have disaggregated data at the state level as well because we can't measure what we can't see and so i'm really excited to celebrate some improvements we've seen this year in the report we see that we have more than doubled the number of states that are that are sharing disaggregated data around things like students with disabilities students who are economically disadvantaged race gender english language learners this is a fantastic improvement but as you can see with 30 to 35 states we still don't have every state able to share and interrogate this kind of data and so we need to do more so that we can identify our priorities and then set goals and establish interventions for improvement based on that data i want to give you a couple of examples of states that are using policy policies like what katie mentioned in order to do this one example is the state of washington uh washington was able to implement a policy that said they would have to collect this kind of disaggregated data and generate an annual report i was just reading the annual report the other night on their website their first report out so they've used data policy to drive equity another example of this is in the state of indiana just this year where their legislature said every k12 school has to offer computer science and our state has to collect data based on all of these disaggregated factors so that we can see where those gaps are and then make investments to address those gaps great news here is that when we have this kind of disaggregated data at a state level then we can bring it together up at a national level in the report and here's an example when we look across the nation what we see when we look at who's in our high schools and then who's in our cs classes one of our greatest disparities is with our hispanic and latinx students that means we've got work to do so what we're doing in the ecf alliance to support that work we are launching a threeyear common metrics project to help states all across the country understand how to build these common metrics for measuring capacity access participation and experience and to contribute to the broader national conversation around how we help everyone across the country address these inequities i'm going to turn it over to katie now to finish up thank you all right well thank you carol it's great to hear about this work that esep is doing to support state teams and data systems it really does matter for this report and for knowing where our gaps are so i know you're all wondering where you can find out more you have the book in front of you but there are so many more resources online so the blue table tents have a qr code you'll also see the qr code on the standees throughout the reception area and it's also of course on the slide behind me and on the back cover of your book you can go to the website to find statespecific handity handouts an accessible pdf and a tableau interactive data visualization where you can see every single school in the country that offers computer science or doesn't you can filter that by state by region by legislative district however you want to be able to see who has access and opportunity so thank you all so much i'd now like to introduce code.org's founder and ceo hadi partovi who's going to talk to us about the next decade of computer science education hadi partovi thank you pat it is so great to be here and to see so many faces in person i actually just wanted to start by thanking both my staff at code.org and also the hotel staff for helping organize the first inperson gathering of the cs community since the pandemic closed the amount of work that has gone into making sure things are safe between the rapid testing and and everything thank you all so please give a round of applause to everybody helping uh pat asked me to start my presentation uh with a brief personal a brief version of a personal story that i shared at the cs.com two years ago our first cs edcon i want to apologize for those of you who attended then that this may be a little bit repetitive but i'm going to make it shorter and i hope for the folks who are i'm seeing for the first time that is a meaningful message but i wanted to talk a little bit before i talk about the future of cs about my why uh you know about my personal motivation for what caused me to start code.org because when you know why you're doing something you put more into it my mother was a computer scientist in iran and my father was a physicist a professor and he started a university to teach technology which has now become the mit of the middle east so between a mother who's a computer scientist and a father who's a professor you could say i had computer science education literally in my blood but that's only part of my why i grew up in tehran iran it's a beautiful country with jungles and beaches and mountains and ski resorts and shopping malls and the main capital tehran is quite different than the stereotypes you see in traditional western media when i was six years old my life turned upside down the country broke out into an islamic revolution and all sorts of change happened in my life i was part of a large family all of whom fled the country my father decided that we would stay behind because he wanted to make sure his university stayed stable during a time of upheaval and life got really really different you know i spent most of my early childhood in constant fear living in a police state you know there were i had friends in our family friends or even family members who'd gotten disappeared and whisked away and for who knows what and i learned that it was safest to just not talk to anybody to act like i was you know to pretend like i was a muslim because that's what you had to do there was forced prayer in school and basically i learned that the safest thing was to not be seen and that was how i would survive and then as the police state if that wasn't enough a war broke out with the neighboring country of iraq which invaded and then my my home was right next to the television station of the country so we had bombings every other night so most of my evenings in my childhood were spent in a basement with a kerosene lamp holding my ears just hoping that our home would get spared and my father would wake up in the morning to go up to the rooftop to assess the damage and so this was basically the repeated scenes of what i saw growing up and then things got bad enough eventually that my parents decided uh we weren't gonna stay there and so then we we decided to move to the united states which itself if anybody here is an immigrant knows is not an easy process but it's extra difficult if you're iranian during the 1980s so we when we applied for admission to the united states we were rejected the first time we were rejected the second time we were rejected the third time but then finally we got in on as tourists uh but then i needed to my parents wanted us to stay permanently as students that wasn't possible so i was actually deported and told i need to go back to my home country we got very lucky that a a generous lawyer helped us basically apply a fourth time and uh the fourth time we finally got to stay uh in the country but staying in america as a as a new immigrant family had its own challenges my family was poor uh that we you know we didn't have our own house uh we had to share a bedroom all four of us with mom and dad my brother and i sharing two twin beds that were stuck next to each other uh i i didn't get to buy my own clothes i only wore very loosefitting handmedowns the first car i managed to get with my brother together we scrapped together 500 to buy our own car but this was still wonderful because we weren't living in fear and we weren't in a time of war what wasn't so great is the discrimination iranians faced at that time my first nickname in school was sheikh my second nickname was jihad literally calling me a terrorist and i learned again to laugh along at jokes made at my expense and to try not to be different than anybody else but after all this my life has turned out to be amazing i went to the best school and because of my parents investment in education i i attended on financial aid and i worked throughout my summers and and school years to pay tuition i majored in computer science i got my first job in technology and since then doors have been open for me and things have just gotten better and better and better and i'm now living thanks to the amazingness of the opportunity systems in this country and the education i had i'm now a nice embodiment of the american dream but i should say still as an iranian in this country it is not always uh roses you know iranian americans even though my skin is white life in the us doesn't come with all the privileges of being white you know iranian americans and middle easterners in general have sought for decades to be classified by the united states as people of color to recognize the discrimination that we face some people get to be judged the moment somebody sees your face other people are judged when your name shows up on a resume or an email and for me this is still personal within the last year i was called arab trash by somebody and also just in the last seven months the association of computing machinery in our own field of computer science gave its highest award the turing award to a professor who explicitly said that he won't help iranian students now why do i say all this i'm not first of all comfortable saying all this because i'm not asking for pity my story is not a sob story my story is a story of opportunity in the american dream and i wake up every day feeling like i'm the luckiest person in the world but what is relevant is anybody who faces struggles or discrimination of any sort learns about the difficulties that others face and learns empathy for discrimination and learns about how how important it is to give people a pathway and a pathway to opportunity and so when i think about my own story i also think about the story of other students students like spencer applegate growing up in rural kentucky in one of the poorest neighborhoods where almost a third of his fellow students are homeless and he in just a hundred lines of code wrote the the rewrote the game tetris on code.org as an as part of his cs principles class but he's too poor to have the phone that he could play the game on where i think of uh araceli casillas growing up in south seattle as a child of immigrants as the first member of her family to go to university when i see these people's story i see my own story and i share that because each of us has our own story of what brings us into this movement into this idea of helping others survive and helping others thrive my story isn't what we put on the on the main page of code.org because each of us with all of our differences have different reasons why we believe in opportunity for our children but that belief is what brings us together our shared belief that opportunity shouldn't depend on the color of your skin on your gender on your family income on the zip code or the country you grow up in on your religion on your nationality this is what brings us together and this is an idea that unites people across states across countries across political divides it is why our movement has been so strong it is why our movement has had the support of every presidential administration in this country as well as presidential administrations from all uh all political sides across different countries and so the idea that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science is not just an idea about opportunity it's an idea about unity and about bringing people together now i want to reflect a little bit briefly about the amazing process that we the amazing progress that we had in the last decade because this is 2021 but we kind of skipped 2020 and we didn't get a chance to ring in the new decade so this is really our chance to do this i first want to show again the the the picture that katie presented it is amazing that we're now finally at the point that the majority of schools in the united states teach computer science when we started code.org it was around 10 of schools we're now at past the halfway mark of getting to 100 of schools that is amazing work and i want to make sure everybody not only celebrates this work for because it's all your work so quick let's do a round of applause this is the work of all the folks here from the united states working on this and i'd love for you to share the news so if you have your phones please scan this qr code it's a link directly to a tweet about this news if you have your phones just scan the qr code and hit the retweet button we would love to share the news that the majority of u.s schools are now teaching computer science and by the way i'm so happy that everybody now knows how to scan qr codes it's like the new skill that we all learned in the last year and a half there's some other things i just want to share about the progress we've made including the progress we've made just in the last two years two years ago on this stage we announced that there were one million computer science teachers on code.org just two years later there's over 2 million computer science teachers on code.org it's doubled in two years time which is phenomenal and it shows the power of technology spreading education and it also shows that even during a pandemic this movement is strong two years ago we also shared that there's 50 million student projects that have been created on code.org if if doubling the number of teachers wasn't enough we're now at 170 million projects created on code.org and again your work is what has made this possible now if you think about the bigger picture beyond code.org we're part of a global movement in education that is now one of the largest and fastest efforts to add a new subject to the global curriculum in the united states all 50 states have passed policies and plans to make computer science a more systemic part of education there's been over 350 million dollars in federal and state funding for this work and over a hundred thousand new computer science teachers have gone through professional learning workshops thanks to all of our partners and the many other organizations working on this problem and globally over 70 countries have now announced plans of some sort for teaching computer science many of them complete national rollouts or requirements for every student to learn and as i mentioned over 2 million teachers alone on code.org alone have begun teaching and the hour of code this simple idea that just started with having every teacher just try one hour of computer science in their classroom has passed over 1.3 billion engagements all of this has been incredible work and so many of the folks in this room are the ones that are responsible for making it happen so thank you for that but we are still so far behind where we could be behind the vision of every student in every school learning computer science when jake shared the numbers in terms of enrollment of students in the united states it's so great to see that we finally have enrollment numbers for the entire country but we are so far from where we could be and we also know that disparities exist disparities in access based on where you live and or your or your income level disparities enrollment especially among young women in ap computer science there's so much we need to do now as we think forward to the ringing in of a new decade computer science is at a major inflection point this is a major inflection point caused by 2020 and the pandemic and the digital divide the last 10 years we had so much success in our movement the next 10 years we are poised for so much more because of the ways the pandemic has changed the importance and need for computer science i want to mention three different ways the pandemic is going to accelerate the work of computer science education in the next three years the first is the proliferation of devices in the united states we are at now at the point where 90 of students have oneonone devices given to them from the school this is a change that happened because of the pandemic when when everything shifted to distance learning and now we have an opportunity to use those devices for more than zooming into classrooms but for learning how to create technology and this isn't a usonly trend uh i was just speaking to to the the i think it's claudia from el salvador who's saying that they're rolling out computers to every single student in el salvador not every country has the same capability but across all the countries there's been an increase in devices the second pandemic change that is helping our movement is that every teacher has had a crash course in technology whether it's learning zoom or slido or kahoot or whatever it is every teacher had to up their technology game every school had to learn to adapt and after decades of thinking that schools and education can't adapt everybody has learned that when there's a need we can adapt our school systems and so that gives us an opportunity to rethink what education should look like in the future there's a third and still ongoing change from the pandemic which is the economic hurt caused by the closures of every business for almost a year everywhere around the world economies are hurting and we're still seeing that today with the issues with our supply chain it's going to take some time for things to come back so the need for opportunity people's need for having a livelihood for seeing a pathway up is greater now than ever before and during in that situation meanwhile what has changed is the nature of work the number of companies that are willing to hire people with technical skills anywhere in any community in any state and in many cases in any country these are all logos of companies that have said they will hire technologists remotely so you don't need to move to silicon valley if you're growing up in rural kentucky you can get a tech job in rural kentucky in fact if you look at the states that have the most job openings in computing california is the largest state with 70 000 open computing jobs the second largest is remote which means you can work from anywhere you don't need to move to california to work in tech you could work from wherever it is and this is something that is not only a u.s change or trend this is going to be a global trend which means anywhere in the world the the way towards opportunity is more going to be about education work will come to where the talent is and so as we think about ushering a new decade we can establish that computer science is more important now than ever before and this has to be our mindset we need to reignite interest in computer science and we need to help educators think about establishing a new normal with computer science as a basic part of it in the united states we've worked so hard to get ap computer science to grow we need to imagine that in the in the 2020s computer science is going to become an equal of the other top ap subjects right alongside english literature u.s history biology or calculus computer science should be at least equal if not ahead of some of those aps in popularity it's still far from there today because it's not even available in most schools but we are definitely going to catch up with that within the next 10 years the other thing we need to establish is that computer science isn't just about tech jobs it's a foundational part of basic education it's as foundational as reading and writing and arithmetic just like you use what you learn in english class when you go into history class and just like you use the math you learn when you go into physics class we're going to need to establish that computer science isn't just its own standalone course it will need to be integrated into other courses as well and in fact for this year's hour of code our theme is that computer science is everywhere to help show teachers to make connections between computer science and other fields like biology like art like history and so on and code.org is going to be announcing its own curriculum efforts in this space soon we're going to make a multiyear effort and commitment to support teachers who want to bring computer science not just in computer science class but into the other classes and subjects as well and in fact every computer science teacher is going to have an opportunity to help their school integrate computer science into physics into chemistry into social studies into art into literature to help make those connections we also need to establish the computer science is more important is more than just coding you know my hat says code on it so a lot of people assume that computer science and code are the same thing but computer science is about so much more and in fact the noncoding aspects of computer science in this decade are likely to become more important than coding when you think about data science ai machine learning and cyber security those three things together might be more important than coding by the end of the 2020s cyber security requires its own special call out i was recently at the white house to talk with all the top tech leaders the top banking leaders insurance leaders and education leaders in the country about the importance of cyber security to our national defense and this isn't just a us issue it's a global issue we are in a cyber world war right now people don't talk about it because it's invisible but our country and every country is in a state of war when it comes to cyber security and every cs teacher plays a role in our national cyber defense in helping citizens know how to stay stay safe online and how to protect their home computers because as we are all connected a student's computer at home is on the same network as their mom or dad's computer who's then logging in remotely into a workplace and one person making a mistake can cause entire systems to go down my last comment i want to make is that computer science is increasingly about solving global problems and this is one of the most important messages we need to establish when i was studying computer science it was about using coding to solve or to calculate the fibonacci sequence of numbers or using recursion to calculate factorials and many of you who learned computer science over the last 10 or 20 years may have heard learned it that way when mark zuckerberg was starting computer science it was about sharing information on the internet we need to establish that computer science is about curing diseases cleaning oceans addressing global poverty addressing gender equality and addressing climate this we need to change our computer science courses to be about solving global problems and to recognize this movement as a global movement the next generation is inheriting all sorts of issues and problems from the older generation and most of those problems are going to be ones that they're going to be able to solve using technology but only if we democratize access to the learning and the skills for them to do that one last question i want to bring up is this question of should computer science even be a graduation requirement this is a question we are going to face over the next decade it's a question that's already being asked in the united states in multiple states there are three states so far arkansas south carolina and nevada that require every student must learn computer science and in fact because of doing that they are addressing gender disparity and racial disparity and income disparity in who enrolls because every student enrolls when it's a graduation requirement there's many other states already thinking about this and code.org hasn't yet decided to put its weight behind a graduation requirement as a recommendation but we are certainly aware that this is a movement and a push that's already happening and i'm confident that over the next 10 years we're going to shift from sort of wait and see approach and and looking at the research 10 years from now we're going to be in the mode that computer science is something that every school not only should teach but that every student should be studying as a requirement for graduating i'm sure that the conditions are going to change in that direction so you need to start thinking every one of us who's working on this problem should think about what does it take to make computer science a graduation requirement what are the conditions that need to be present in terms of the schools the teaching capacity the universities the funding etc to get us to get a state or even a country to be ready for that change if we think 10 years out we should be able to get every u.s student studying computer science by 2030 by making a requirement for graduation and if you think globally within 20 years we should be able to get to every single student in the world by making it a requirement for graduation this is the ultimate holy grail in cs education is making it required for students it's not something we've talked about very much but it is going to be something that over the next decade becomes part of this movement now this movement is a community effort and i'm so thankful for all the organizations that are here with us it's an educatorled movement that started with teachers teachers like juan lonzano in my own neighborhood of south seattle who brought computer science to their own school and from their school spread it to their entire district who helped make policy change happen in all 50 states and we're now at the point that all 70 that sorry that 70 different countries have announced plans it is amazing for all of us here to be part of a global movement and when i think about this global movement i want to return things to my own personal story and my why when i came to the united states as an immigrant my family didn't have very much i was learning a new language i was learning a new culture i didn't even have the the right fashion sense to dress correctly for the my first day of school but what i did have is a fantastic ability to code and a pathway in education that helped me succeed way ahead of my peers and way ahead of my dreams and so my story is a story of opportunity but my story is also the same as the story of araceli casillas or spencer applegate or of katie clemens in missouri who in her apcs principles class built an app to help diagnose her friend's mental her classmate's mental health or of these students in johannesburg south africa who are participating in africa code week or this young girl in in rural popayan in colombia and this work is thanks to teachers everywhere like flo von in oakland who are globally bringing more and more students into computer science their story is all a story of opportunity at a time when our world is full of despair this movement brings people hope and opportunity and at a time when the world is increasingly divided this movement brings people unity it is a story of unity and so i want to close by thanking all of you and the over 2 million educators and partners together you're helping changing the face of computer science thank you so we have we have some time for uh a couple questions and we have these two microphones right here so if you'd like to come up and ask a question of hottie this is the opportunity to ask i'll ask a question of hadi ari uh what is the the greatest challenge we face coming out of kovid in terms of uh raising more awareness around computer science that's a great question i think our greatest challenge is the same challenge we've faced for the whole time this movement has been growing which is the challenge of perceptions about whether or not computer science is part of basic education most adults think of education as the school they went through and so when they think about computer science they don't think of adding it at the same level as math or english they think of adding it like as an after school activity or a maker lab or something for the special kids getting adults to think that this is as foundational as reading or writing or math or science and it belongs as a pillar of education that is by far the hardest challenge to change hearts and minds but we are lucky because of the pandemic that there is a new opportunity to rethink things people are more willing to rethink education just like you see people are willing to rethink the workplace that we have an opportunity because of the pandemic to actually break through in terms of this this perception great thank you hottie any other questions come on up come on up to the microphones and you can ask a question of our ceo here and please introduce yourself hey hottie my name is mark barnes i'm a computer science specialist with the state of arkansas i work with the arkansas school for the deaf and the arkansas school for the blind and visually impaired what kind of work is code.org doing right now to help students particularly students with blindness and visual impairment who may not be able to use like a blockbased coding environment or some of the other tools that are currently a big part of computer science education that's a really good question you know students with learning disabilities of any sorts are are a different group that is underrepresented in computer science and there's work that needs to be done when it comes to deaf students code.org has done a lot such as putting captions in all of our videos and a number of other activities like that when it comes to vision impaired students code.org's own courses aren't directly supportive enough but we've partnered with a group called access i think access cs out of university of washington working with a tool called quorum to make a a version of our cs principles course designed for visually impaired students and this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart so we haven't we haven't yet announced plans for doing things to to support visually impaired students but as we think of new ides and new ways to teach computer programming you know not only the block based coding is vision based if you look at the actual output of the programs it's usually drawing art or making apps or making websites and one of my personal interests is to see can we shift to you know using python or java to make music or to make chat bots you know voice chat like alexa these are also technological systems that you don't need your eyes to be able to interface with the computer to listen to music or to use voicebased uh computing and i think but those are going to be opportunities we tap into in the next decade thank you good afternoon definitely i'm height deficient sorry um good afternoon my name is fran bromley norwood i am the k12 computer science administrator for the clark county school district in nevada um and i my question for you is is that when you have the opportunity to go to the white house primarily to talk about cyber security as we're aware unfortunately the internet infrastructure globally specifically in our country in order to make sure that they're getting those opportunities that are the plugged version versus the unplugged version of what code.org offers whereas conversation discussed i know that there have been a lot of input and communication regarding making that happen i was just wondering whether or not you've had an opportunity to demonstrate that code.org would like to support that in order to make sure that students you know countrywide are able to access the amazing programming that's available for them so that those numbers get higher in terms of exposure to computer science well we have advocated for increased connectivity in schools throughout our existence we're lucky in the united states that there's billions of dollars a year being provided by the federal government for school internet connectivity although we're still not at 100 of schools the the picture of connectivity in schools in the us today is far better than eight years ago when code.org started and globally even it is improving but far far behind but i am hopeful that internet connectivity in schools as well as device availability for students those are things that are growing even with or without code.org my main goal is to make sure as we connect up schools and as we give devices to students let's also provide the education for them to not only learn how to use technology but how to create it or how to understand its societal impacts and i believe that's actually the harder challenge because there's lots and lots of people worrying about connecting schools and not enough worrying about computer science education but thank you so much thank you and pat i think we're all set yeah we have uh two more questions hottie okay um hi heidi i'm ann leflich i'm a professor at indiana university and i'm a code um csf facilitator for next tech and also copi for the esup grants um my question really comes in as we're talking about elementary and you're talking about all the different areas um where computer science is incorporating ethics and incorporating ai and data science and cyber security what do you see happening to your elementary curriculum and how is that going to be adapted to either include those things or do you see that as something that is going to be included up in the higher grades that's a great question so the code.org cs fundamentals elementary curriculum already includes aspects of digital literacy digital citizenship cyber security we recently added our ai for oceans module into that just to make sure those students learn about machine learning as part of cs fundamentals but the real effort that we need to do is the one that i mentioned earlier which is basically creating learning units for integrating computer science into math into english into art and into the other subjects taught in elementary schools because when you think about computer science in elementary schools code.org has and and scratch both have spread very broadly as kind of a special in education but they're not systemically included in most schools and one of the best ways to be systemically included in elementary education is to also be included as part of math and english and the other subjects that are effectively baked into elementary education and so as we think about shifting from sort of a teacherled effort to teach coding in k5 to making it more of a districtled effort part of our work is going to be about creating the curriculum lessons for integration into math integration into english integration into social studies etc and and that's the future of where our elementary curriculum is going thank you crystal franklin c.s for clea out of cleveland state university and of course esep uh you mentioned there are uh three states that currently require cs4 graduation do you foresee any danger and i'm going to use danger in the way you think of mandating that where there's resource poor districts and the option to opt out may create actually the reverse effect that's a great question and in fact you're to the the question she asked is is there any danger to mandating computer science for graduation there absolutely is and that is why i said code.org is still in a waitandsee mode of trying to understand how things go in the states that have done this and getting a better sense of what the conditions on the ground need to be to make it possible uh the dangers of mandating computer science for graduation without thinking about it the the most obvious danger is kids not graduating beca you know the other danger is at schools that don't have the capacity to teach computer science you know what do they do do they not graduate students or what are they cut or so on so but thinking about mandating it for students forces you to address all the other access and representation and funding issues and there's many states who are then looking at that and saying what what can they do about it there's a state that i where i've been talking to some of the leadership of a state where they're talking about first of all reducing some of the other graduation requirements so it doesn't raise the bar on students and about providing funding to every school to teach computer science and also offering an online sort of option for a school that doesn't have a cs teacher at least students can learn it online and certainly anthony owen who's here from arkansas can share if you talk to with him later what are the steps arkansas took getting to cs as a graduation requirement requires all the other work first to get to uh you know if the the the slide that cal showed about the cape framework it requires the capacity and the access and and the then finally this brings in the the participation and the experience for students thank you for the questions very important to keep it in mind howdy thank you so much for uh giving us a vision for the future of computer science just a couple notes per those questions you can visit code.org accessibility if you want to learn about our accessibility uh work including with deaf students and students who are visually impaired and as per the last question that crystal asked about states we actually have a session about that how to make computer science and graduation requirement the right way actually featuring arkansas the national governors association as well as south carolina if you're interested in that visit that session tomorrow right now we have regional networking and so in about 10 minutes you're going to be in these different rooms depending on whether you are in the midwest northeast south or west now you might be wondering well actually what what what is my state is it is it midwest or is it is it south well if you visit csedcon.com schedule you'll find a listing of the states per those different regions so those are those rooms those rooms you'll actually find right outside this door to the california ballroom and down the stairs and then around the corner those that's where all the regional networking rooms are as well as all of our sessions go ahead you are dismissed you
