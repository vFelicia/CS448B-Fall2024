welcome to code.org's second panel on engaging black students and teachers in computer science education my name is dr sabine thomas and i'm based here in tacoma washington i'm joined by my colleague leolin bowen who is based in austin texas we are leading and coproducing a panel conversation series on engaging black students and teachers in cs computer science leoland and i are both members of the education team here at code.org we know that black students make up 15 of the overall students demographic 13 of the demographic in school teaching advanced basement or ap computer science but only account for six percent of the students who take the apcs exam this is part of what we are here today to really unfold in the comment section below as this youtube rolls there is going to be information about engaging with us as you listen in today there's also going to be information about providing us some feedback at the end of this broadcast so that we can continue to share additional insight about this very important topic i'd like to start with our land acknowledgement as a way to honor our indigenous and native american presence as well as land rights in our everyday life and two to recognize the history of colonialism and a need for change in settlers colonial society we'll look closer to home here the coastal salish tribes from seattle as well as the pial tribe in tacoma and from the caribbean roots the tainos and kiskaya leolin my wonderful colleague will now introduce you to ice team moderator sheena glass welcome leoland thank you sabine before i introduce shayna i would also like to take a moment to recognize the indigenous and native presence here in austin texas we are in the land of the tribes of the humanos tokawa the pachen apache kuala in the comanche now i would like to introduce you to our moderator ms shayna glass shayna is currently the program director of technology applications and stem at aldine independent school district she has been in education for the last 16 years educating students and teachers alike shayna holds a master's degree from sam houston state university in the field of curriculum and instruction with an emphasis in instructional technology she's a graduate from morgan state university receiving a ba in fine arts she is currently the president of the csta greater houston chapter as well as the code.org program manager for our regional partner at rice university school of mathematics go ahead and run it yourself i know i got it i want to take the time to thank both leoland and sabine for this opportunity not only for myself but for our students and teachers here in alden independent school district it is a pleasure to moderate this panel today you're going to hear from two students as well as two teachers here in computer science in my district martinez is a senior at blanson cte high school and is joined by luniqua who is a 9th grade student at davis 9th high school they will be joined by mr banks who's from blanson cte high school as well and miss hammons who's the computer science teacher at aldine ninth uh high school all here in houston texas perfect great shayna so we know that alden isd comprising comprises 15 schools has over 95 representation of underrepresented groups in computer science so code.org defines underrepresented groups as black and african american hispanic latino latina latinx native american alaskan and native hawaiian and pacific islanders we also know that over 75 of the student population receives free reduced lunch based on socioeconomic status reported to school districts aldene isd is exactly the school district where we want to increase computer science representation so as you facilitated the panel conversation what are two surprising factors that were shared that you didn't expect to hear from the students and the teachers well one of the very first things that enlightened me was how even with the time this distance between our teachers and students of when they were exposed to computer science they both were brought in in very similar manners so time doesn't escape the way that they are gaining their first exposure to to the area the other thing that surprised me was the student representation of african americans in our high school classrooms in computer science hearing martinez describe in detail how the numbers of african american students in these classrooms drastically decrease year every year was a bit of a surprise thank you shayna and leoland everyone as you listen to our panel conversation today we'd like to ask you to give your undivided attention to our guest and to lend an ear to the conversation um around the term minority it was very interesting for me shayna and i see leolain shaking ahead as to how everyone conceived and perceive the term minority um lioland in your introduction you explicitly stated um how we are defining underrepresented groups here at code.org really in terms of you instead excuse me of using the term racial minority as we know that people of color today comprise the global majority um we also want to highlight that the students experience from aldene independent school district may or may not reflect the realities of all black students and teachers as our culture is incredibly rich nonmonolithic and incredibly geographically um diverse so we are so delighted shayna to have you facilitate and moderate this panel today um we thank you and our students as well as well as the teachers and we now want to make sure that we have the opportunity to share a welcome address from our chief programs officer jackie smalls very quickly a bit about awesome cpo jackie smalls she has a rich background in stem education having served as the head of programs at black girls code and previously running professional learning programs for discovery education impacting tons of students and teachers she served as an environmental scientist in the u.s army yes she's a vet a school teacher and one of the standard writers on the next generation science standards she resides in southern maryland only minutes from the district of columbia in virginia and jackie proudly leads our education programs team we hope you enjoyed today's panel discussion as much as we did thank you on behalf of code.org i would like to extend a warm welcome to our viewers to code.org second panel in the series of engaging black students and teachers in computer science a heartfelt thank you to our panelists students martinius luniqua and teachers mr banks miss hammond and miss glass who are joining us from alden independent school district in houston texas we honor and respect your individual and collective experience with today's conversations centered around the experiences of black students and teachers in computer science we hope that teachers students and our stakeholders across the country will be inspired by their stories thank you and prepare yourself for an authentic and engaging discussion i want to welcome you all here for the conversation with us today on a real comfortable conversation on your journey into computer science so i'm going to start off with the first question and that question is what was your first experience or exposure to computer science and i think i want to ask miss hammond first hello everyone thank you for having me um my first experience or exposure to computer science was actually in college when i chose a major one of the required courses was fortran it was actually um not a great experience for me the class started out pretty good but um a week before the final project was due my project crashed and i could not figure out i worked day and night hours upon hours lots of tears trying to get my my crane to open and it never did um and my professor had absolutely no sympathy but that's okay um you know i take that experience i took that experience as an opportunity for me to rethink what it was i wanted to do for the rest of my life and i decided that chemical engineering was not for me mechanical engineering was not for me so i changed my major to chemistry so i do owe that professor a great deal of gratitude in that experience with fortran was an eyeopener for me um but when the chance came for alden isd to host computer science i remembered that course and i decided what better an opportunity for me to prove to myself that yes i can do it um so i'm thankful thank you miss glass for extending to me the opportunity absolutely absolutely let's go to a student martinez what was your first experience um or exposure to computer science i believe my first experience with computer science would be somewhere in the summer of the seventh grade year so sometime in middle school uh a lot of it was just me experimenting i found joy in just sitting there and creating things so i ended up teaching myself a little bit about multiple uh game development softwares because that's what i kind of lean more towards the game development side of computer science and i kind of just taught myself a little bit about everything over summer until i was able to finally get into a school like blanson where i can kind of prioritize learn in different coding languages such as java python and really reinforcing my foundation excellent excellent let's come back to a teacher mr banks what was your first exposure or experience with computer science my first my first exposure to computer science were in college uh i did not decide to major in computer science until the last minute uh when i went to my freshman orientation i was late and when i got there there were a lot of different lines going in different directions i picked the shortest line at the time which was computer science not knowing it was the longest line because the line went out the door around the corner into another building uh yeah that's how i got into computer science uh but once i we started talking about computer science and talked about a lot of math and at the time i really didn't like math i was okay in it but i wasn't really good at it because it was math at the time right but uh we used punch cards back then we had to program a program we had to write our programs and then put our program on a punch card so once you get your programs on a punch card you have to take your punch card or your stack of punch cards to another machine to run your program and one day i tripped and my cards went all over the place and had to start all over again because the punch cards were not numbered yeah yeah it was interesting the punch cards were not numbered so i had to go back and reprogram my whole program get all my stack of punch cards again and put it in the machine to get it to work that's how i got introduced into computer science wow wow well we think you did you need to get by for 30 years wow luniqua lunique what can you share with us your first experience or exposure to computer science um my first experience was in seventh grade it was just like a very very short introduction um it was like math class and since we were basically done with everything for the year my teacher just was just like oh we're gonna start coding but it only lasted for a day so yeah my real like real full experience is this year though so excellent excellent so i'm gonna i'm gonna start with the students again this round i know both of you have different experiences um and opportunities in computer science but what i really want to know is what keeps you motivated to keep programming like what what keeps you wanting to come to class especially now what keeps you coming back let's start with laniqua nico answer that for me what what motivates you to keep coming to your teacher's class um i think the main thing that motivates me is the fact that i i really enjoy coding i i don't know it's just really fun and i most of the time i feel relaxed when i'm coding so it and that feelings you know you just keep wanting to do it again and again so what helps you stay challenged in that class um the new lessons that we get every week is is progressively getting harder so i'm having more challenges that i i need my teacher to help me with but overall yeah um it's getting more challenging as we go but relatively it's not that bad thank you uh thank you for keep for coming back we know that that can be it can be challenging from the teacher's standpoint martinez what motivates you to keep programming especially yeah to these these challenges that you face where you are a high school senior where what keeps you motivated in computer science okay all right uh i really actually like this question because i feel like a lot of computer science students or people in general will drop out of their i guess their their goal uh because just lack of motivation and especially if you look into the game development feel that's a lot that's the biggest issue at the moment is just lack of motivation to continue your project due to like just repetitive actions you know coding is something where you'll end up doing the same thing a million times over uh but for me what really kept me motivated uh was just the people in my class it was really enjoyable going to class and helping the other people in the classroom seeing them learn a bit more and then helping myself as well throughout that process our teacher also made it uh really fun to engage in class we had a lot of assignments where we after learning like a long course we'd go on to make a small game to complement it and maybe we learned how to use print statements and we'd make a textbased adventure game and that just kept everyone engaged and it kept our attention and i feel like that really helped keep us going but as it pertains to outside of the classroom my biggest motivation would definitely be my friends i do have like a little discord channel i'll be in for a large amount of time and whenever i work on projects or make games i'll post it in there and then they'll play it and we'll just kind of go over it i like that so i'm going to piggyback off of that question martinius and ask you um you both you and laniqua stay on the student side um so do you enjoy what you're learning in class are you enjoying the curriculum and then there's a twopart question does it reflect your culture so the focus of today is how do we recruit africanamerican students and teachers into computer science do you see yourself in your class let me start with you martinius okay i definitely believe that and just to make sure that i'm getting this right can you repeat the first portion of that question so are you enjoying what you're learning based off of what you said previous i'm going to assume that you do but i'm asking more on the cultural side are you enjoying what you're learning do you see your culture reflected in what you're learning and more just generally do you see yourself in your class in computer science class i definitely do see myself in computer science class but i think that's something based on an individual i feel like it is what you make of it so when i enter that classroom and when we're given projects there's a certain level of individuality to it so you can choose what you want to do and how you do it so there's no set path to complete an assignment for example and even though most assignments might be something like simply completing a equation or making a calculator there are times where you get to add your own little touch to things and i feel like that's where you can incorporate your culture i know for me working on assignments such as and this doesn't really pertain to computer programming but when i was working on my business management assignments for stuff like coming up with restaurant ideas i would join my culture a jamaican born i'd maybe make a restaurant caribbean delight that sells jamaicanbased products and i do the same thing with my programs for example you can set variable names to something related to your culture and that's kind of just how i keep myself incorporated and i definitely do see myself in my classroom okay luniqua tell me do you see yourself reflected in your computer science classroom um in in the class that you take now do you see yourself in what you're learning um i never really thought about it i i don't i don't necessarily see myself like i mean i see other students that look like me but i don't when i first think of computer science i don't think of myself if that makes sense um yes it is can you explain why or what what what did you first see when you think computer science i don't know someone with lighter skin yes like just stem based careers in general is just like people with lighter skin um so i never really consider computer science or anything like that oh i i don't i've never really incorporated my culture because i don't i don't know how i would go about incorporating it when i do my assignments and yeah i think i think you've you've answered it very well um both of you did actually i'm going to come over to the teacher side now and i'm going to ask you you both ms hammonds and mr banks some directed questions based off of their responses so thinking about the number of students in both of your classes what percentage are girls what is an un the underrepresented population uh prefacing that aldean represents mainly underrepresented popul relations um how many of the students in your class look like you so i'm bringing this now to mr banks and it's hammonds let's start with you miss hammonds so when i look at the dynamics of my students um let's start with gender we purposefully when scheduling our students went for making sure that our female students was populated because it was important for us to let them know that these are opportunities for them in the field of computer science and let them know that we are looking to help female students grow in that area so me being a female i wanted to make sure that yes we need females get them in there so i would say that um off the top of my head not 85 percent of our students are female in at my campus um in terms of uh people who look like me africanamerican we have two and that's not a lot considering i have 25 students in the class and only two of them are africanamerican um but i i think it's more because of the campus that i'm at it's 90 hispanic so um for computer science they had to have taken algebra 1 um as a prereq so that limits the number of students we can pull from so i'm hoping that next year we'll have more of an even spread of africanamerican and hispanic students and definitely still sticking with encouraging our female students to get involved with computer science absolutely mr banks tell me about your classes i'm mute force mr banks okay sorry about that can you hear me now okay um four is the percentages of male versus female is about 85 percent male and 15 female in my classes uh as far as the percentages of students that look like me it's probably about 25 percent africanamerican students and 75 hispanic students okay martinez has requested to to elaborate on this question as well uh martinez go ahead and share with us um from your perspective okay so for me i know that when we first started our first year in our computer programming we actually had a fairly even split of students in terms of demographic but as the years continued i know in the second year i believe we lost almost half of the class so in terms of like we were saying earlier about people who stick into the class to the motivation i definitely feel like there's a large amount of people that we do lose over time it's not necessarily that it'll start in the field it's more or less that they drop out and a large amount of that are people that are like me for example i did do a little after school girls who code event but i showed up as a assistant to help mandate the students and help them out a bit and i know that we start off with i believe around four students on the first day female students and that number dropped down to about two but i am glad that they did stick around until the end i remember that day distinctively i remember going over to blanson when you guys kicked off girls who code and it was i was intimidated there was so many guys um and the girls kind of huddled and they were kind of shy but um i'm glad to know that that a couple are sticking sticking with it and and coming through and you are right it is about um perseverance right so let's go let's keep going let's keep going um i'm gonna ask this question about sticking with with uh us talking about people who look like us let's define minority so when we think minority we think of us as a minority but if you look at us globally we're actually the majority right so when it comes to your class are you seeing meaning and you know minority here in aldine minority we come in all shades of melanin actually we're speaking on hispanic and um an africanamerican but how would you define minority when it comes to people that look like us how would you define minority in your classroom and i'm asking for like your definition of minority knowing that we are the global minority majority sorry we are the majority globally but how would you define it now let's start with you miss hammonds so when i think of minority um i think of everyone who is nonanglo nonwhite and that's my definition of minority so if i'm putting it in terms of my classroom 100 of my students are minority because i have no white students all of my students are either africanamerican hispanic descent or of asian descent so that's how i would define minority okay mr banks how would you define minority uh mute yourself for me sorry about that you're fine i have to agree with what you just said uh we're all minority of our at uh blanson in my classes uh africanamerican hispanic and asian uh there are no uh white students in my classes so i would agree with what you just said okay so now i want to hear from the students because i'm really curious if your definition of minority is the same as the teachers so martinez do you consider yourself a minority in your classroom okay so for me i guess the definition of minorities is a little bit different i like to think of minority as those who lack opportunities whether that's due to this their environmental circumstances or just how they've been grown in you know over time so for me minorities can be anyone in a sense of course we usually find minorities to be those of my character just due to a lot of environmental or situational circumstances because like you said before we are the majority even though we are seen as the minority and yeah like i think that's a that's just it has to do with a lot of situations so where you grow up and the opportunities you were given i know uh miss hammond said that she was looking for a wider bracket of students to choose from but algebra one was a requirement and that kind of shows that the minority there are those without the opportunity to take that class excellent excellent feedback uh lunique what your thoughts what is your definition of minority um um i think my definition of minority is more like the teachers um just as like not as like in the world and the world because you know and that you know in the world we're the majority but for someone living in the united states we would be considered the minority and with my classes basically everyone's a minority if you live in the united states i i guess if if we were talking on a global scale i guess it would change but for now it's it's like non i guess just poc yeah yeah i would i would agree with you um let's talk about let's talk about recruiting okay so i'm gonna start with the teachers what are some obstacles that you currently face in engaging and recruiting um black students into your classes mr banks tell me what tell me your thoughts unmute yourself you can tell this is my first time doing this uh i really don't have any obstacles because this is my first time first year teaching so i really haven't had the opportunity to recruit so i really don't have an answer for that particular question have you started recruiting for next year i have um i've talked to all the students in my class and i get to out i ask the kids to get the word out to their friends that might be interested you know word of mouth sometimes go a long way miss hammonds how about over at um audi 9th at your campus what do you what are some obstacles that you you see engaging in recruiting um black students not only to come to your class from from middle school right but from your current students to keep going so um let's tackle that first part in the fact that just like martinez martinez said um that requirement of that prereq of algebra really limits the student pool that we have so when i think of recruiting for computer science i also have to think of recruiting for algebra one on my campus i am the algebra or the department chair and the skill specialist for algebra so um they work hand in hand so i need to push for more minorities to be involved in the algebra strand in middle school if i have any hopes of increasing the minorities in computer science in high school yes ma'am you are absolutely correct i have to jump in on that part of the conversation because i am finding that that is something that is um definitely a hurdle here in in texas as it might be nationally um trying to trying to push for the advancement of mathematics in students um luniqua and martinez um how do you feel about engaging with your classmates that aren't in your computer science class to encourage them have you spoken to your classmates um in regards to the classes you're taking this computer science class hey are you interested um lunique i'm gonna start with you as a ninth grader and i'm recruiting you right i'm i'm taking charge to like did you know did you know did you know but do you speak to your friends that like are you explaining to them what you're doing do you have those conversations um i i rarely talk to my classmates if i don't already know them because i'm virtual but i don't i don't think i necessarily talk to them about computer science i might show them like a project i'm doing like oh this is so cool this is so fun you should try it out or something like that that's probably the extent like i've gotten one of my friends she isn't in all beans she's in a different district but i got her to sign up for the summer immersion program so yeah truly appreciate that for your recruitment you don't know just just as mr bank stated that goes a very long way when you hear word of mouth and if there's something that you're doing definitely bring a friend along right because maybe in the district they're in it's not just about where we are we need the this nationally so i appreciate that that's the start that's the start that's the start martinez tell me how you um talk with friends who aren't in your computer science classes okay so for me i actually do this quite often because i really like what i do and like i said before i like to make little small mini projects and back when there wasn't as much restrictions covered 19 wise i used to actually after creating these small projects i just showcased them to either close friends or just people sitting at the table to kind of just get their attention and that usually leads to someone maybe find an interest in it i know there are a few people who have had uh come to the computer programming class and i'll help them out just to kind of keep them on i know there's a few people have thought about i'll even and i just give them that little extra push to kind of help them along so i definitely think that i do do a bit of recruiting even though not intentional it's more or less just me trying to get feedback on my work uh and yeah i give kudos to both of you because both of them you both are helping the two teachers on this call those are things that they need to hear okay so let's talk about um a tiny elephant not a big elephant but a tiny elephant since you brought up the coven 19 restrictions um and this may be in the time of where you're both virtual students right or when everything was normal let's talk about your social emotional health and this is on both fronts both student and teacher around computer science how from the student lens how how are you doing with all of the workload that you have and the focus with the challenges in computer science right your the assignments like luniqua you said you know every week it's a new assignment it gets a little more challenging how do you balance that with all of your other classes and still continue to come let me go i'ma start with you and then martinius i want to hear from you and then we'll come to the teachers and i'm gonna rephrase that question just a little bit go ahead laniqua oh i got a question how do you balance the challenge in computer science the work the amount of work you have a very challenging teacher he likes to just give it to you giving a shout out to mr gunther ever at uh over at um davis ninth high school he he's he's a stickler you know i know i know how he works um how do you balance that along with all of the work of your other classes uh for our class uh it's not the workload isn't that bad and also mr glinter is very helpful so i can always go to office hours or email him and say oh this is what i need help with if you have time can you help me with this or something so it's a very it's really easy to balance the class with everything else going on excellent martini is how do you balance your workload in computer science and all of those other classes i actually haven't found much issue balance in my computer science workload and i believe that's just because i prioritize it over my other work i like to think of computer programming as either my mind my mid or end goal it's something i want to do in the future and continue doing so i tend to take more care of my computer science work and i think that's probably what's helped me keep my workload down to a minimum minimum we appreciate that we appreciate that uh we will definitely be sharing this with your students ms hammond and mr banks so let me rephrase that question for mr banks and ms hammond how are you doing with the workload of trying to get students to do the work when you know that they have all these other classes both of these students are excellent but how is it with your your classes your computer science classes uh miss hammond we'll start with you how is it going for your students and you okay so um i'm in a unique situation where this is my first year teaching computer science so i'm learning at the same time as my students so just like martini has said i have to prioritize but because i feel like this is something that i want to continue to teach i make sure that on my own front when i finish learning in class with my students during class time that i also learn after work on weekends on saturdays like today so i'm continuing to grow my own in my own way in terms of how to get students to prioritize i have 25 students and i can honestly say that unfortunately of those 25 students only a handful actually started with the program and are continuing to work and are current in their um their learning who reach out to me when they need help so i want to say it's because of the virtual environment that we're in that i'm not seeing as much success as i had hoped and i'm really looking forward to next year when we are more face to face in helping to motivate and because i can only call home so many times to get them to try to come to class and see the value in the class and enjoy it as much as i do but if they can't see me and they can't see my enthusiasm then it's hard for them to get motivated to do the work so um i struggle at times with ways to motivate students so i'm happy to hear from our two students today to try to take back some things that i can do differently to encourage our students to get more involved i agree with you i completely agree with you mr banks tell me how how is um how are you balancing the the social emotional needs of your students with your with the workload as you're teaching cs2 csa right you you have a different level of coursework and and if they're in that class they have a hefty amount of coursework as well in all of their other classes um how are you managing that and how are they handling it i think the best way that i'm managing it is that i try to keep it fun you know my students that are virtual they don't get the opportunity to see me have fun so i have videos that they can actually join in to an actual classroom and they can see how the other kids are having fun in class we do a lot of projects on the board we do we have like projects where we play games uh and the the students that are at home notice that wow we missed this i missed this so next thing i know during the classroom they change it from virtual to classroom because they want to have fun as well i like that i don't have any really issues i just as long as we're having fun and learning and that's i think that's why they're telling their friends we're having mr banks is having fun what do you think about coming to his class or do you want to know about mr banks like first thing they say is who is mr banks because i wasn't there last year so this is my first year there now i have people come by hi mr banks how you doing that used to walk by me just don't say anything so they have a lot of fun in my class so i like that i like that um for both teachers um what supports do you have in place to support you in your instructional needs as both of you are new into so mr banks you're not new to computer science you're new to aldine but miss hammonds you're not new to alden but you're new to computer science so what supports do you both it's true it's true you guys are like the you're the reverse of each other uh mr banks um and ms hammons let's start miss hammons samus what supports do you have in place um to support you as you're going through this journey well um i have to say that my teals volunteers have been absolutely amazing they have thought outside the box for how to encourage our students ways that we can provide incentives to motivate our students to do the assignments and to learn computer science not only do they work with the students but they always ask miss hammond what are you working on in your course because they know that i'm studying to take my exam for computer science they're always willing to help and provide me support so i am so blessed and fortunate to have the tills volunteers to help me in addition to the teals volunteers i also have a great network of um of instructors that are teaching me the found the um people who helped students initiatives yeah yes the initiative through of the partnership with university of texas so i'm grateful and i haven't taken my court my test yet i'm looking forward to it but i do feel like it's very beneficial and um i'm excited about the opportunities that are to come mr banks tell me about your supports to support your needs i would have to agree with my assistants uh teal's assistants they're outstanding outstanding this is my first time actually with assistance and they just outstanding that's the best way to explain it um or is the uh i guess force the support of my uh uh teachers the teachers in this administration at blanson they're outstanding you know me being new to alden i mean i couldn't have a better staff a better administration i think i i just love it i'm having a great time i'm having more fun than anything and i think that could be bad i'm having more fun than probably some of the kids that's a good thing you need teachers need if the teacher's having fun it makes the students want to have fun right um miss hammond's uh the question came up about what e d i is it's computing um i just want to explain it to the audience that the cdei is a initiative that is in partnership with the university of texas where they were recruiting minority teachers um teachers of color trying to help them to gain the certification to teach computer science so it's computing educator diversity initiative and they recruited uh teachers and i sent it out to the entire district and we have six teachers uh actually in a cohort here in aldine who are a part of that program to bring more um minority teachers into computer science so miss hammons is is she's trucking along um in this in this journey and she's gonna be extremely successful um as we keep going and it's a magnificent program so um i'm just super honored that that she took that took that took that you know that baton and and ran with it because that's that's um that's what's needed um let's see another question i have for you all is how is this contributing to your overall growth so leniqua tell me how being in this class where do you you and we we partnered all of you all strategically liniqua you are starting your journey martinez you are starting the next phase of your journey right liniqua how do you see this moving forward so we've had a conversation about the opportunities in computer science for high school for you as there are for all of the students in alden but how do you see this moving forward how do you see yourself moving forward um well now i actually added another major to my list of mages that i might want to take in college so yes um i i just see a future for myself in computer science yes it's really fun and i've been enjoying it and it has a lot of opportunities so i'd be willing to go through with it next year or my facial expressions i can't i can't contain myself because i i have been in recruitment um one is better than zero right that's like 100 jump so i applaud you for digging deeper martinius same question um how do you see yourself moving forward from what you've learned from from let's say from you start your selftaught days right when you step started this journey and you're like i just want to dig a little deeper and i'm going to teach myself i'm going to learn and then you made it to blanson and now you're a senior what is next for martinez from everything you've learned in computer science uh next for me would definitely be going a step further you know going to college i've already gotten into my computer science major so i'm going to be going through that and getting all the information that i can i'm still doing udemy courses trying to learn as much as possible and then from there i'm hoping to get an internship sometime in during college and just start my career from there my end goal is definitely trying to become someone who can work separately from others maybe not a big company but being able to create games myself and sharing it with the community that would be my biggest goal but for me every step of the journey is just one path to my end goal so if i have to you know work for a bigger company for a while i'm completely fine with that as long as i'm gaining experience and doing what i love that is wonderful that is wonderful i'm going to expand on that um just a little bit how has computer science how do you think computer science is going to contribute to you personally professionally emotionally and financially in the future um luniqua tell me a little bit more about that what do you think maybe uh that's like probably the first idea that's possible in my head helping you strengthen strengthen your math that's that's a that's a definite start um martinez woody you you just tell us your your future endeavors but how do you think you seem to have a steady head um emotionally how do you do you think that computer science has has helped you in that has assisted you in in your balance i definitely think it has when i think about going through high school i know there was a lot of worry people trying to figure out what they're going to be doing and what the future can hold for them luckily i was able to find my passion early on and i had my gold in mind so emotionally i wasn't as stressed as everyone was trying to figure out what the next step is i was already taking minds and i feel like a large portion of that is thanks to my endeavors in computer science and i guess it works a bit more emotionally as well in terms of if i'm feeling down or i just have nothing to do i can just open up my computer and start working on another project that i found fun or exciting and it'll just perk me right back up okay so i'm gonna ask one more question to each of you and um i'm gonna i want you to just give me your personal opinion on this because we're talking about recruiting more students and teachers what do you feel is missing when it comes to recruiting think about both of your campuses right well all for all of your campuses there's three campuses represented here today but different lenses student lens teacher lens what do you think is missing when it comes to recruiting what is what do you think as a district we need to do and maybe as a campus we need to do to recruit more africanamerican students into computer science um and what do you think what will be your next step based off of this conversation we're having today so mr banks let me start with you and then i'm gonna go to martinez because you're both at the same campus but i'm curious your thoughts my thoughts is um what we can do to improve or recruit students i think we need to recruit more female students in computer science as i said it's only 15 female we need to work harder to get more student more female students involved and i think if they learn from uh get the word from friends uh and see how much fun they can have and how much how many how many opportunities they can learn from computer science i think that number will skyrocket um as far as myself i try to keep it fun i have a computer program a computer science class and i have a technology class we both have fun i think i'm going to get several students from my technology class in my computer science class because they're having so much fun and the technology they programmed a little bit to get a little bit of everything in the technology class so i'm looking forward to see a lot of them in my programming class next year excellent excellent um miss hammons what about you what do you think the district can do i'm sorry let me go to martinez first martinez what do you think you would want to see the district do or your campus do to record recruit um more students that look like you into those classes okay uh i definitely think that the major kind of decider is the balance between showing them that the class is fun and also that it is some math involved it's hard uh i know that our first year we had a bit of an issue or i would more so the second year the students started finding out that this class isn't all fun you know it's not just making games there's a lot of math involved and it gets pretty difficult it gets pretty rigorous so i think that find the balance between that would be nice i know that uh back when we were still given tours uh as a student ambassador i'd lead the middle school students around our school and give them tours and when we bring them to the classroom i'd have my projects pulled up on my computer but i'd also have on the board there'd be little math problems and little equations on the side just showing them that yes you do get to make these really cool projects and it is really fun but you also have to work hard to solve different problems but i think that maybe showing them that there is some excitement in solving a problem like there's some euphoria once you get that last question correct that can also help bring them just a step closer excellent excellent um miss hammons um tell me how you recruit how do you think the district should recruit so um i think we i think i talked about a little bit about it earlier because of the prereqs i think that we need to do a better job of making sure that we have the representation for our algebra students because math and computer science go hand in hand just like martini has said you cannot do computer science without having a strong math background so i really feel like we need to do a better job of recruiting students to take algebra 1 in the middle school not just looking for those students who are typically represented but really stepping outside the box to find out hey listen your grades may not have always been great in math but i feel like um you're a hard worker let's see if if we put you in this program if you can really take off in a different level or a different direction than you have previously um i think that and i'm going to take it back to my own experiences in high school i've always been good in math and science my grades did not reflect what i was capable of doing i was a c student i did not take algebra one until later unlike my friends who were really really smart they took algebra early i did not and it wasn't because i couldn't but i didn't have anyone to really push and to say listen you can do this you've got a good strong head on your um shoulders let's see if we can push you push you a little harder so i really think for students like myself who were the middle of the road not your top students not your bottom students but right there in the middle we have to recruit those students those are the students who who are capable of doing computer science and we need to focus our attention and efforts on them if we have any hopes of increasing minorities in computer science and aldine isd i completely agree with you i'm going to add to this on how involved or engaged in the recruiting process are parents and counselors in recruiting students um miss hammonds you're shaking your head so how how how involved are they so i'm just gonna be honest um i'm gonna do my best to phrase this as i'm politically correct as i possibly can our counselors do a wonderful job with scheduling and um it's this time of the year where our counselors are going out they're beating the streets so to speak they're getting our students to sign up and to select courses for next year but they don't know what computer science is so they don't know how and i can't say they don't know i'm not aware that they understand the benefits of computer science so they can't recruit the course they can't push that course like we can because they just you know their job is to get students to sign up for to select courses for the upcoming year but it unless they really have a firm understanding of hey these are some options for you in terms of career choice um and this is how computer science can help lead you and push you then they're just getting students to sign up and i don't want to sound negative because they're doing their job they're doing the best that they can but in terms of recruiting computers minorities and computer science the only way that's going to happen is if we um have uh what's the word i'm looking for i'm going to say remove your initial biases your your you know you only know what you know and if you are unknowing you just assume these are the right students for this class which limits which students take the class so you're right uh providing the insight knowledge uh professional development for counselors is needed in the recruitment of students providing them with the correct resources and um just opportunities for learning what computer science is is absolute key martinis you wanted to jump in and elaborate on what miss hammond was uh was saying uh mute yourself i definitely agree with uh miss hammond's uh overall message and i think it kind of ties back to what we were saying about my definition of minority and the lack of opportunities like she was saying that maybe she wasn't the best in math or she was really good but it wasn't showing and i feel like we place the limitations our place may not necessarily be the limitations required for the class in a sense a student might not show the potential to be someone in the pro computer science field but that might be exactly what they want to pursue i know that transferring from a lot of different places so i went from jamaica to new york from new york to houston uh there were a few times where either my file wasn't found or i had to redo a a grade because it didn't match up with maybe the way that state did it uh in this different place so i found myself either retaking classes just because of requirements that weren't necessarily correct for lack of better term and i think that's definitely something we've seen the computer science field where necessarily maybe algebra one yes it's a good requirement it is something that is required but that might not be something that is shown on file i will say this too i'm just adding a tibit on that that algebra one requirement is is almost a hindrance in computer science now i think it was something that's antiquated that was added a long time ago that has not been removed and we with the exposure of creating a foundational level of of understanding for students for computer science before secondary like before they get to middle school even students who have more insight and maybe learning mathematics through computer science more than in the actual math class they're taking meaning that they're prepared to continue on and that has again not caught up with the current trend um on the state side that that prerequisite is not necessary maybe if it's done in conjunction meaning if you're in algebra one while you're taking this class depending on the course you know maybe that would help with recruitment and having more students of color go into computer science but i i do agree that depending on where you are you you might have to wait until you take it and that's that causes issues if i can't take it because i don't have this math um leniqua how has or how does computer science come up as a choice for next year like how have you seen the next course how have you learned about the next course how are you how are you hearing about this is this from your counselors from your parents from your teachers how have you learned about the computer science pathways um hey last year um i didn't even know computer science was the class oh i i guess now since i'm in the class i'm hearing more about it and the opportunities and the different classes within it that you can take but i don't think there's like much representation of the class when you're in middle school like at all because i didn't know it was a class until this year yeah that too would come from this is new for our district too but that too would come from um preparing making sure that it's prepared with counselors so that it's seen all over and hopefully we see more of that miss hammonds go ahead and add so i just like to say that our counselors don't get a chance to interact every day with the students so they may not be aware of what the students um are capable of doing but we as teachers see them every day every a day every b day so we know that just because their grades don't necessarily reflect um their intellect it doesn't mean that they're not capable of doing it so we as a as teachers have to do a better job of making suggestions to hey to reach out and to work in partnership with the counselors to say that i have the student in my class the grades may not have been the best but i really think that you know that they are capable of doing it and reaching out to the parents to let them know because sometimes they are unaware as well these are some opportunities that the students can get involved with what do you think about it let's try it let's give it give it a go um and if nothing else at least you know whether it's something that you're interested in doing in the future or something that you just want to shy away from absolutely absolutely you guys have been a breath of fresh air and definitely have given me a lot of insight and reflection on how i can further assist this um here in our district and hopefully our conversation helps others all over the the country hopefully you you all agree and um i just want to thank you all for taking this time to on this saturday to spend some time with us and hold this conversation yo
