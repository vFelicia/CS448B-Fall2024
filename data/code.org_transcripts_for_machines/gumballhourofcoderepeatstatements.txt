Can you imagine if you had to repeat something forever and ever? Hopefully you never have to because computers are really good at repeating things. This is the repeat forever block. Anything inside this block will happen forever in the game. If we want an actor to do something repeatedly without the player having to do anything, we'll put those blocks inside the repeat forever block. In this next puzzle, our goal is to help the actor do a job continuously. Learning how the repeat commands work will save you a ton of time later when you build your own game.
