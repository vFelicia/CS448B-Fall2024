Time to get creative and use your coding skills to tell a story. Your story will have actors and you will be able to make these actors talk and interact with each other. So create my own game. So I have to move around the cat and the dog and make them say things. Start thinking of what kind of story you want to tell. The cat's always been afraid of the dog and what if the cat figures out the dog is just trying to be nice? The "when run" block starts everything. The "move" block will move your character and the "say" block will make your character say whatever you type. I was making the dog come over and say "Hi." She'll be all scared. This is the "when actors collide" block which you can link up to the other blocks. I was making the dog come over and say "Hi" but then the cat got scared so it ran away. "Ahh" If there was more time, it would have been a happy ending. The end!
