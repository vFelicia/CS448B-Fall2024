Now, we're going to learn about something that all game programmers use everyday. They're called events. An event tells your program to listen for when something happens. When that thing happens, it performs an action. Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click, an arrow button, or a tap on the screen. Here, we're going to make the space bot greet the earthlings when a player clicks on him. We'll use the "when clicked" block and attach the "say" block to it. When the player clicks on the space bot, everything attached to this "when clicked" event block will be performed. What does your alien say? There are also "when arrow" blocks. If you link the "move" blocks to these, you can start to move your actors up, down, left, or right. Step by step, your game is getting more interactive. For me, part of the reason I wanted to start a game company was because I wanted to make games I wanted to create something that people could love, play and enjoy My advice for kids who want to do things and learn computer science, just start doing stuff. Start playing around. And maybe if you're a little insecure or a little afraid, that's okay. Find a friend who maybe has a little more experience. Look at video tutorials. Just jump in there and try to create something. Even if you might be like, "Is this a little cheesy?" Or even if you want to look at it and say "Well I could just go play that somewhere else." The act of trying to create something in your own vision is an amazingly fun experience and I just encourage people just to DO stuff. That's really the most important part.
