hi everyone my name is kylie and i'm super excited to be here with you today i first just want to say thank you to all the classrooms that are tuning in to the my journeys class chat today teachers just a quick reminder that we've enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats going forward today we're excited to welcome christopher lopez who spends most of his time trying to catch people doing bad things with computers as part of tanium's security operations center team teachers make sure to put your students questions in the chat for the q a and we'll be able to ask chris those questions at the end of the talk now let's start with a fun icebreaker to get us started i was thinking about candy this morning who doesn't want candy for breakfast if i had candy for breakfast it would be a snickers bar chris what about you what would you have for breakfast if you had to choose candy so i was gonna say snickers you complete that for me so i had to think back um i love peanut butter so it's gonna have to be reese's oh gotta love those as well also well can you just start by telling us about your work what exactly is your job title and what do you do yeah uh so my official job title is security analyst i work as you mentioned in a security operations center uh it's just a fancy way of saying a bunch of people that work together to try to find bad things and protect uh company uh so i consider my role to be more aligned with like a computer detective i'm trying to identify or see when something bad happens or maybe try to catch something before something bad happens and then we basically work together my team and i to let people know about what's going on and we analyze things like that that is so cool could you tell me a little more about what your typical day would be like for a computer detective is it like a real detective do things change depending on like your case file or what's happening in the world yeah uh actually let me share my screen here and i'll start with like my battle station so you guys can see you know what it is that i'm trying to do and work with a battle station oh i'm so excited so here is where i spend most of my time is in front of this computer i hope that you are able to see it um i hope i'm sharing right perfect awesome so um a lot of my day is spent right here standing i got a standing desk recently i didn't want to sit down i know a lot of us have dealt with working from home recently and that's something that's helped me um so i spent a lot of time here looking at logs so essentially um what that is is okay perfect example would be uh whenever you log into your computer uh example like windows computer and you type in your password your computer basically writes a note of that somewhere on the computer so it basically says oh christopher lopez logged in at this time you know from this location i spent a lot of my time looking at those records that computers write about stuff that happens and i try to use all of that information to tell a story so i try to translate what a computer is saying about stuff that happened into something that is more understandable and something i can have a conversation with other people about oh so this and this happened at this time which led to this thing occur wow that's i love that uh telling a story i think that's something you see in a lot of computing related jobs i am curious though what is your absolute favorite thing though about being computer detective if you had to pick one thing so solving problems and trying to understand how things work uh so this is an example of where i spend most of my time this is just like a log file um and this is looking at specific logins this is more for like mac like you know apple computers uh but this is where i spend most of my time is looking at how things are written to a computer and like how that stuff looks like i love understanding why something happened the way that it did when it happened and trying to answer those very basic questions that we try to answer to figure out you know what's going on so this is an example of where i'm the happiest is looking at things like this another example would be looking at another set of logs in a different machine and trying to piece together what does this mean and trying to answer the question of is this bad and how can i determine if something is bad and uh yeah so a lot of problem solving nice i'm curious how did you decide to become this computer detective see that's an amazing question uh because it all just worked out honestly i had no idea that i was gonna fall in love with cyber security um i started out you know in i.t so it is more focused on at least what i used to do was more fixing computers and basically making sure that computers are running for a company and making sure that everything is running the way it's supposed to so i started studying security as a hobby i got a lab set up at my house you know with a couple computers that were very old and i just started trying to understand like how things work and what ended up happening was and lucky for me um i ended up talking to the right people that led me in the right direction of like hey you can actually have a career with that hobby and i had no idea that those two things can actually coexist like that uh so it ended up working out perfect for me nice could you tell me a little bit about why cyber security is important and perhaps how it affects your community yeah um so to me cyber security is important because a lot of people that are in my role specifically as analysts that are helping companies try to solve computer related problems is everyone benefits from computers being more secure or networks being more secure and that's basically what we try to do so in my job as i mentioned earlier we try to let our leadership know so like our managers and their managers know about things that we discover which then leads to a change in the company potentially uh which ends up anyone that uses a service that is you know created by us or created by another team it's safer to use that's awesome i am so glad there's people like you making the internet safer and our computers itself i am also kind of curious what skills or abilities does your work require is that something you had to build up before you took this job or is it something you built on the job so to me the most important skill that every human being has because this is like innate in the way that we are is curiosity just being curious about stuff i spend so much of my time just trying to answer the question of why like why is this the way that it is so that led me to security it works out perfectly because i was like why does this like hack or whatever you want to say why does this thing work that way like how is a computer able to be taken advantage of by someone that's malicious or trying to do something bad like how does that look and how can we look and find things like that so curiosity to me is one of the biggest things and that led perfectly into another skill set that i think is important and that is just trying to understand how computers work like a fundamental understanding of computers and just digging into why certain things happen this a certain way at a certain time is super important and that's all because of uh your own curiosity oh i love that being curious is just such a great skill and ability now i want to do a quick reminder to teachers please use the q a to post any questions you have for chris and now let's jump to the next question which is kind of fun i am really curious about what you do outside of work do you have any hobbies i'd love to hear more ah yeah um when i'm not staring at a computer screen which i love by the way i don't mean that in a bad way um i spend a lot of my time staring at a tv stream because i love playing video games so there's that uh i have a 10 year old and him and i are constantly playing video games together i can share uh here something really quickly just to kind of showcase uh you know where i spent a lot of my time outside of work uh here we go let me do that so this is my second battle station in my opinion this is where i spent a lot of my time playing games with my son i mean right now we're playing like the latest pokemon game together uh pokemon legends is fantastic i love it um and this is something that i use to you know uh wind down after working even though i love what i do another example yeah um also i really love to run and be outside you know we spend a lot of time with technology especially now and luckily i actually ran a race with my son recently he joined me and since i live in orlando i get to go to all the really cool theme parks here uh and here goes an example of that running and taking my son to you know to universal because harry potter is amazing and uh we get to do that together dang i'm jealous i want to go to a theme park right now let's all go we can get on a plane right yeah awesome well i'm curious chris when you talked earlier about your job how do you work with other people you talked about you know looking at the logs like do you have to have meetings to discuss your findings what do other people in cyber security do yeah so that's the beauty of this field in my opinion and that's it's such a vast field there's so many different things that people can do i for example am not really a developer or someone that writes code on a daytoday basis but i work all the time with another team that's basically part of the security team as engineers and they help build the tools that our team uses in order to investigate things which is super cool and if someone really enjoys coding i mean that is such an amazing field to get into because it's part of security you're just building a really awesome things and new things that is so awesome i actually got a cool question from mrs carr's classroom going back to your hobbies what video games do you play i know you mentioned pokemon but what other video games do you and your son play so we have been spending a lot of time recently playing a lot of old games uh i'm trying to get him into a lot of the collection that's on the switch right now for uh the snes the super nintendo uh so we've just finished uh metroid like a really old game yeah fantastic i love it uh and it's actually really hard more difficult than i remember i think we're getting a little bit lazy with our games now everything is so helpful uh with games and yeah another one uh that came out recently i've been playing a lot of halo multiplayer i know that's more for like older uh you know people but it's been fantastic uh so there's been a lot of that recently that's fun maybe some of the teachers play halo and some of the students might be older you might be playing halo hey there you go who knows awesome well i have another classroom question from carlin's class they want to know how do you actually stop the hackers or the hacks from happening i know you talked a little bit about finding kind of the breadcrumbs in the logs and such but is there anything you could do to prevent it from happening or is that what you were saying the engineers do yeah so that there's an entire cycle with how that works so first you need to identify that something is even happening in the first place once you identify meaning you just see that something bad may be happening then you move towards like how do i like contain this like how do i stop this let's say that it's for example like a file a virus that's spreading first thing would be like how do i stop this from spreading right in order to basically stop the quoteunquote the bleeding of that situation and then from there you move towards how do i mitigate this right like meaning how do i fix this from happening in the future right so that's where the preventive cycle comes in like that would be like a lot of things you may hear in the news about like oh there's this new vulnerability right and then you patch that vulnerability like you do an update like you see like how windows for example would be like hey there's a new update uh usually that comes with things that are made to secure that pro that application better so you may patch something for example or you may upgrade something in your environment to prevent that from happening in the future uh so it's a cycle detection containment uh being able to stop hackers is well let me say malicious hackers because i think that there's a sometimes a negative feeling towards the word hacker i consider myself to be a hacker but a good one a lot of people in the field consider themselves to be that too a hacker to me is just someone that likes to understand how something works and likes to see how they can change it to make it work for them in a certain way um so catching and stopping is a little bit difficult because sometimes when you find something this may have occurred months ago or this may have occurred like you know a week ago so you may not have the ability to stop at that moment but you can prevent from there or you can attempt to prevent things from happening yeah that makes a lot of sense and i think that's a great reminder that hacking there's bad hackers and good hackers sometimes called ethical hackers and if you were interested in trying to like solve puzzles and break things computer security is a great field because you can really try to break things as an ethical hacker and then that helps these computers and internet products to become more security hardened so that there's less chance for the bad guys to get in awesome i've got a question here from david higley when did you start your cybersecurity journey i know you talked about how you weren't expecting it um but yeah when did you get started um that's a good question i i feel like i'm getting a little bit older now i got to think back like what year it was but it wasn't right after um you know high school it took a while for me to go to college it wasn't something immediate i went to college when i was probably i think maybe like 2223 so there was definitely a big gap i didn't get into cyber security until around the time that i was like 25 i was fortunate enough to land into that role without much college behind me nice i've got another question from odyssey charter how can we as users of technology use this type of log analysis to make ourselves safer is that something you can do or would you advise any other tools to make yourself safer using computers in the internet well that's a really good question i'm not sure how log analysis translates to that um i think blog analysis really helps when you're trying to like troubleshoot for example like you're trying to figure out why something is not working the way that it does uh from a more how can that be more secure perspective i'm not sure that that is like i didn't like a direct correlation to that uh personally i mean there's so many uh things out there to try to make you uh safer on the internet um i would say one of the things that i i'm always talking about from like just a general basis uh just given the fact that we leverage we use so many things now that are like you know on the internet uh like whatever it is like we're trying to access like our google account we're trying to access our microsoft account or school account i would say that one of the biggest things that you can do to protect yourself is to use some kind of like password vault protector or something like that somewhere you can store all this stuff i know one password i don't know any other passwords because everything is stored in this place because that's like one of the things that hackers and malicious attackers leverage to be able to access people's things uh unfortunately so that's what i would say from a log perspective i mean i think it's really great like go in there and learn how those things work and it may translate you may find something that's like super cool that you can use to protect yourself better um but yeah i hope that answers the question yeah thanks chris i think that's a great reminder to everyone password managers are fantastic in helping you keep all your passwords super secure and you only have to remember that one password i personally use a password manager and it is so helpful and it makes you feel safer on the internet and going back to those logs i think some of you in the audience might be learning about computer science or maybe even cyber security i am curious what advice you would have for the students out there listening you know so we were talking about logs you might be looking at debug logs for your computer science program there's lots and lots of opportunities for this like cross translation um but yeah what advice would you give to the students out there today listening yeah um advice uh i would say to try to find something in this field if this truly interests you uh find something that you really enjoy to do if that's solving puzzles from a coding perspective right where you enjoy writing code spend all your time learning and master that like that is so cool i didn't have that love i loved the analytical side of things like being able to figure out what's wrong or what happened here and that led me to loving what i do so this is the same thing i tell my son all the time you know he gets interested in things and he's like looking at this video game and he loves it i'm like well why don't you figure out like how that's made um you know how that works use your curiosity to be able to answer those questions of like why did this ball move from this location on screen to this other location what how does that happen um for follow like what really brings you joy because that's like to me the biggest goal ever is to work and do something that you actually enjoy to do as a career thank you so much chris this has been such a fun conversation and i hate to say we're at the end of our time so we are going to just also thank all the teachers and students that have joined us here today um remember that we have a lot more of these class chats coming up so later this spring you can watch more we also have a lot of recorded ones from the past fall recordings you can just go to code.org forward slash cs journeys to find all of those and teachers will be sending out an email with a survey if you could please fill out that survey it really helps us and we so appreciate your feedback thank you so much it was such a pleasure chris and great to see all the teachers and students here today thank you
