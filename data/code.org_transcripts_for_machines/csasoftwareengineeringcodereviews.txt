hi everybody my name is gemma bissoni and i'm the ceo of discover labs i'm javon and i'm a cs student at uw seattle i'm levar and i'm a software engineering manager at airbnb my name is pan and i am a software engineer at xbox probably one of the most important steps in pushing code looking for ways to improve it or ways to debug any problems that already might be there you can go in and you leave comments and you have a conversation with the person who wrote the original code and so it's half in a second page of eyes code reviews are important because they ensure the success of your code and your product we don't always see our own errors as the weeks and months roll in i could see the evolution i was writing better code and how the overall code base was better every time i check in code on git i make a pull request and it mandatory must be approved by at least one person it's a very powerful teaching tool first run the code make sure that everything actually works and then we'll sit down and look into it i look for a lot of common errors depending on like the language how is it running is there anything there that could be potentially broken if something gets updated after that then i look mainly towards logic learning a little bit more about the algorithm the efficiency the concept the mental map any tests that could possibly break the program it's a great way to learn not the only way but a great way code reviews they they make the code better and they make the person writing the code better as well think of it as proofreading by writing code that's easily readable by commenting things if anyone else were to look over your code it makes it way faster to understand what's happening it's a way of telling the computer what it's going to do and you're going to want to be able to understand what you told the computer to do if you have someone on your team that is a really good code reviewer give them a chance to stick with them and listen but that code review helps bring in a lot of different perspectives i mean you have different engineers from different teams people who are in charge of different parts of the code you have to be able to write it in a scope where somebody else will be able to pick it up from you because you are not going to be working on this one thing forever that's what core review is about you
