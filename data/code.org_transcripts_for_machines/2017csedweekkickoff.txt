computer science education week and the hour of code for the representatives from those groups who are here today can you raise your hands can we get a round of applause for all of the people on these committees lastly to the cs teachers who are tuning in over the live stream with your classrooms the work that you are doing in the classroom every day is the most important part of this movement thank you truly for the work you are doing to bring computer science to your classrooms can we get a round of applause for the teachers now in the past we've kicked off computer science education week with world leaders such as barack obama and justin trudeau this year we're honored to be in silicon valley with leading women in tech susan cheryl and peggy johnson now the they are amazing but the computer science education sorry women in computer science actually goes back to the very beginning computer science education week is held in december every year to commemorate two women ada lovelace who was born on december 10 1815 and designed the very first computer program and grace hopper who was born almost 100 years later on december 9 1906 and has been a pioneer in the field of computer science while the tech industry today is mostly male the teacherled movement to bring computer science to our classrooms is dominated by women in our workshops we see that about 86 percent of the teachers attending to teach computer science to their classrooms are women and we have leading women who are inspiring running the organizations many organizations in this space including deborah seahorn who is currently running the computer science teachers association and is here today and we'll get to hear from her later now for hundreds yes for debra absolutely for hundreds of thousands of teachers around the world their journey began with an hour of code during computer science education week this week and at this point over the last four years we've had four hundred thousand four hundred million hours of code done around the world and this week we're going to hit 500 million hours of code served but an hour is only the beginning and most of the teachers go beyond an hour to teach years of computer science in their classrooms in the last four years we've seen incredible momentum we've had over 120 school districts start teaching computer science we've had 40 states pass policies to support computer science and a dozen countries have added computer science to their national curriculum that is only the beginning and today with the announcements you're going to hear today you're going to see how fast this is growing at this point the computer science education movement is the fastest growing movement in the history of education now to kick off this worldwide event i'm pleased to have peggy johnson susan wojcicki and sheryl sandberg here today i'd like to first introduce peggy johnson an executive vice president of business development at microsoft peggy oversees microsoft's partnerships acquisitions and venture fund previously peggy spent 24 years at qualcomm in leadership positions across engineering sales and business development she has been recognized by multiple organizations including business insider as the number one most powerful female engineer in 2017. please join me in welcoming peggy johnson how about this one how about this one there you go y'all can hear me thank you uh alice and hottie very much it's um on behalf of microsoft it's a real honor to be here and to celebrate the wonderful code.org community um co.org's mission is deeply personal to me i am an engineer at college i learned a code and my first job outside of college was coding and computer science has in many ways been the foundation of my career it's really changed my life but i have to say um it almost was an accident it wasn't supposed to be that way and i'll give you a little bit of the back story on that i am one of 15 kids so i have 14 brothers and sisters in my family um there's a little bit irish catholic in there that's how that happened um but i had the uh the unenviable position i wasn't the oldest i wasn't the youngest i was one of the 13 in the middle so for those of you who remember the brady bunch i definitely had some jan brady syndrome but my parents had two rules um one you had to go to college and two you had to pay for it yourself so uh following my older brothers and sisters as younger siblings do they had already uh gone off to college and many of them had become business majors and so i just sort of followed in their footsteps went off to san diego state got a job on campus and started my what i thought was going to be my my business degree and one day i find myself delivering a package to the engineering department a place i have never been to before in my life i didn't even know where it was i'd ask people how to get there so i walk in and i struck up a conversation with the two executive assistants who were behind the desk and who were strangely so excited to see me and what i didn't realize is they'd just been having a conversation about how they could get more women into engineering and the sad fact was they just they they tried they just couldn't get more in and all of a sudden i showed up in front of them so these two ladies they went to work on me they sat me down on the clock by the way and they said so what are you studying you know what are you going to be do you like math and science have you ever considered seeking a degree in engineering and frankly to be really honest no i didn't even really know what engineers did to tell you the truth there was no engineers in my family growing up there you know it was business majors and these two ladies just started working on me and working on me and i remember something that still resonates with me today they said the world will be your oyster if you pursue an engineering degree and the next morning i woke up changed my major to engineering and i tell you this story because it has a lot to do with luck when i looked around at my classes they were it was under 10 and the double e department were women i was i was just there by pure luck because of this package i had dropped off and frankly the the issue is that for too many of our young women today for too many of our young people of color for too many young people all together luck is still too much a part of the equation and as computer scientists luck is not a variable we like to deal with data okay probability odds things we can change but luck not so much and for me i wanted to be able to to change this number and for you the opportunity is there every day we are improving the odds with our kids when teachers introduce them to our of code when schools and districts scrape money together to get a computer scientist on their payroll and every day we can change a kid's life by saying to them hey have you ever thought about pursuing a degree and hey have you ever thought about going after coding and learning how to code so it's really incumbent upon all of us to to change that equation um in computer science or sorry code.org is all about really it's all about changing that equation leveling the playing field for all of these young kids it's why microsoft is so deeply involved in the program we're a founding member of it and we're continuing to embrace that vision because every child should have the opportunity to be able to change the world and coding is one way that they can do that no matter where she was born no matter who her parents are no matter what hallway she walked down to get there so thanks very much i hope you enjoy the rest of the day thank you peggy and now i would like to introduce you to susan wojcicki susan wojcicki is the ceo of youtube the world's most popular digital video platform used by over a billion people across the globe to access information share video and shape culture an early champion of online video who was instrumental in google's 2006 acquisition of youtube susan now oversees youtube's content and business operations engineering and product development please join me in welcoming susan to the stage all right so good morning everyone i'm thrilled to be here at this very special event and be here among students and educators administrators tech leaders celebrating something that just does not get enough attention that should get a lot more attention which is computer science education um so let me tell you my own story which in some ways is actually similar to peggy's story about how i developed my own passion for computer science so as a kid i was always doing creative projects drawing painting candle making mosaic making paper making you know all those favorite all those little art kits they sell in the store for kids i probably you know always wanted to do every single one of them the thing is i had never connected that computer science was actually a creative way of making services products that had the impact to change the world so um what happened to me was i didn't pursue it i actually have a degree in history and literature and my senior year in college i by accident interned at a startup i actually worked for this temporary service i used to come home from college and say just send me wherever you want sometimes they sent me to lawyers office doctor's offices everywhere and one time by accident i was sent to a startup and after i was there for a few days i realized wow there's something interesting here and i was answering the phone at this place and i thought you know i actually would like to do more than answer the phone i think i could do the same type of work as the people here in the office how do i do that i'm going to take a computer science class now i was a senior in college writing my thesis studying history and literature and i thought surely it is too late for me because i'm 20 and i'm a senior and my life has already been decided um and i just can't change but i had a friend and she was taking a computer science class and i always think back to that about how influential everyone can be whether they're a student if you're an eighth grader you can influence a sixth grader so my friend was taking a computer science class and i thought you know if she's taking it i can probably take it so here i was i signed up for computer science my senior year as a history and literature major um and took it and that's how i discovered my passion for computer science uh um it was it was amazing to me that this one class really changed my life and i'm always grateful and think wow my life could have been very different if i hadn't had that one experience in that one class now i was very lucky to take this class but in today's world where technology is changing every single thing we do it shouldn't be about a matter of luck computer science actually does a lot in data as we talked about and computer science is something that should be available to all students students also shouldn't have to wait until college i'm amazed the way a twoyearold can pick up a phone and figure out how to use it our kids today are digital natives they should have the access to learning computer science today in their school but many kids do not have that opportunity google commissioned a study and it showed that only 40 percent of kids in k12 schools in the u.s offer computer science class and have access to them and as low as that number is the good news is it's an improvement because two years ago the number was only ten percent um so it shows that we can make progress when we focus on it and i do think code.org definitely had something to do with raising the number from 10 to 40 percent but we still have 60 the majority of kids still are not getting computer science and that's why there's so much important work left to do now it also has an impact on diversity the ap exam for computer science has the worst racial diversity of any ap course only 22 percent of students who take the course are students of color and black students in particular are less likely to have access to computer science classes compared to white and hispanic students so unless we make computer science something that is available to everybody we risk making these racial disparities worse now on the other hand if we provide it to everyone we also have an opportunity to benefit everyone and if you look at the economy you look at the importance that technology and tech jobs play in our society there are nearly half a million open computing jobs in the u.s in every state in every industry and they are projected to grow at twice the rate so we have a chance to enable all kids no matter where their background is where they come from which family they grew up with their only child or 15 one of 15 to give them the opportunity to have these experiences google has been working to provide funding to nonprofits to expand coding in schools we have our made for code initiative to inspire girls to take coding and as part of cs week we're encouraging students to also try the hour of code and we're doing a project to build a holiday emoji so if you're looking for a good project to do with your kid this is one and you can create your own google logo with the special coding activity and we also have a google doodle that encourages people to solve a puzzle using simple block block coding so i'm very happy to be here kicking off this week i can't emphasize enough how important this area is for every kid out there in the future and for our community our society our country and the opportunity to enable all those great kids out there in the world to really be the next leaders in technology and to make a difference for our world so thank you for being here i'm excited to kick off all the projects that we're going to be doing together thank you thank you susan and now please join me in welcoming sheryl sandberg the chief operating officer at facebook cheryl has overseen facebook's business operations as ceo for the past nine years when she joined in 2008 facebook had 70 million users and 550 employees the like button had yet to be invented today over 2 billion people around the world chase check facebook every single day and the company employs more than 23 000 people please join me in welcoming cheryl well i am so um honored and excited to be here today with this community who are really leading the investment in computer science in our area and we all know how important that is um joining peggy and joining susan i'm grateful for your friendship and your leadership we all are here to make feels weird to have this i guess i could put this i guess i could just put that right in there you see the kind of expertise you get when you work in technology we all know how important this field of study is both in what computer science gives us in terms of the products we build the impact the products have in the world but also opportunity for people i am just so proud of hadi and alice and the team of code.org hattie and ali have been longterm friends of mine really helped me transition to silicon valley and the work code.org is doing which is really transforming education and giving millions of students who otherwise would have no access and no exposure to computer science i really believe can change our country so congratulations to both of you and your team for your leadership the thing about jobs and technology is they are incredibly high impact incredibly high paying and incredibly flexible and when you think about what people entering the workforce want they really want the ability to make a difference and i think all of us in this room know that there's probably no better field to do that than the field of technology people also want in increasingly economic uncertain times job stability and the ability to know that they can always get a job and no matter what's happening really in any economy right now anywhere in the world the people who have more than full employment are the people with these technical degrees despite all of the concerns about unemployment we have in our economy and so many others there is a huge gap in unfilled technology jobs not just here but all around the world so if we're looking for the answer for economic growth for financial stability for families getting more of our children into these fields we know is a huge part of the answer it's also the case that when i think about what families need women and men to be flexible to have both careers and personal lives so that women are no longer no longer say to women you can't do both something we never say to men these are always these are almost always the most flexible jobs you can have we used to have a joke at facebook that we and it's not sure anymore but for many many years we had this unbelievable programmer that really no one had ever met because he didn't like to work in the office with other people but he was unbelievably productive and for people in this field who are unbelievably productive the type of flexibility we are willing to offer them and all the companies are willing to offer them shows how you can really integrate both a personal life and a professional life so really on any metric on anything we care about whether it's society or opportunity or impact or having jobs or being able to balance work and family this is an unbelievable field the problem is we do not give equal access to people to get in there 98 of the people majoring in computer science and colleges were exposed to computer science before they went to college that's an amazing statistic and that shows how important the work code.org and so many people in this room are doing we also have to think about not just getting the usual suspects into this field but getting everyone into this field women were 35 of computer science majors in the 1980s it's 18 today many years ago i hosted a summer party for a bunch of the facebook summer interns and there were so many boys like eight years ago and i said to one of them like where are all the girls and he looked up at me and said there are more daves than girls in my major in college and i looked at him i thought he was joking he was like no i counted there are this many people named dave and this many girls majoring in computer science at my school that's a problem and unfortunately one we are not making progress against same situation for the black and hispanic community is only 15 percent of the people majoring in these fields are black or hispanic and so what we need is equal access to computer science education and to motivate and excite everyone and let them know that this is a field they can excel in this is a field where they can really achieve and this is important so that we get to equal representation so that the products we build reflect the diversity not just of the people who use them but of the people who build them this is a really big priority for facebook we are putting large investments into funding into training support and jobs uh there we have lots and lots and lots of programs but i'll mention two i'm most proud of the first is we launched computer science and engineering lean in circles with facebook linkedin the anita borg foundation and my foundation the lean in foundation and the idea lean in circles are small groups that meet to support each other i think eight or ten people even though we have one in houston that they say they have 200 and they say everything's bigger in texas so they don't have eight they have 200. but it's any group of women or men who meet once a month together using the materials we provide for free to lean in to support each other in their ambitions a few years ago we launched computer science and engineering specific lean in circles to solve the problem for girls that they are surrounded by daves and not by girls so if there's only a few girls or one in their computer science class they're in a group that meets regularly to support them we now have over 250 circles and we're covering a huge number of campuses and we're grateful for the opportunity to work with those folks we also are working on tech prep with mckinsey we really studied what leads to a computer science path 90 of parents who want their children to learn cs but 77 have no idea how to pursue it so this is an online resource hub designed to reach parents we've now reached 1 million people in 50 states and i know that google and microsoft and other companies are talking about making really important investments and again i'm so grateful to susan and peggy for the partnership our companies have had on this we're at the beginning of our journey and the opportunity for us to come here and celebrate the people in this community who are leading who are making computer science accessible and open to the usual suspects we want everyone but also to more women and traditionally underrepresented minorities i'm really grateful when i think about all the problems we face and there are real problems right now i think about what makes me optimistic and what is core to being a technologist is that we believe that the future will be better than the past not perfect not the technology will solve every problem not the technology doesn't cause some of the problems we're realists and we understand all that but we believe fundamentally deep in our hearts that the power of technology is one that lifts people out of poverty gives people opportunity and brings us closer together and that will continue to happen due to the great work of the people in this room for which we are super grateful thank you thank you cheryl now cs education week is not about code.org it's about all of the organizations the district the schools and the teachers who are in this space and helping bring computer science um to all of our students and this week for computer science education week there were more than a hundred different organizations nonprofits districts states countries making pledges to expand computer science now we don't have time to share all of them with you today but i'd like to invite peggy and cheryl back on stage and come on come on up yes um and we're going to read you some of the amazing work that's going on um we're going to start with districts we had over 70 school districts who are making pledges to expand computer science as part of computer science education week cheryl do you want to start by sharing some of those yes we're super excited because pledges which are the announcements of commitments to invest are what uh keep this progress going all right so not too far from us in fresno california the central district pledges to bring cs courses to all students grades 7 through 12. the amazing and the fresno i have more and the fresno unified school district is going to offer cs courses at all 10 of their comprehensive high schools um i think i'll suggest we hold applause till the end because there's so many good things to applaud here we want everyone to feel the applause okay in houston texas the dist where they have large lean in circles and my brother lives which has nothing to do with this at all uh the district is expanding advanced computer science courses to all high school students by the end of the 2018 school year and staying in texas the garland district is going to work over the next three years to provide cs for all k12 students at each of their 72 campuses by 2020 the lincoln public schools in nebraska will offer comprehensive cs education to all 42 000 students and finally hillsborough country public schools which is not hillsboro as i was pointing this way it's in tampa florida we'll expand cs offerings to 27 high schools and 46 middle schools during the coming school year providing access to over 90 000 students hold the applause we have more so in georgia walker county schools is implementing a new cs curriculum in all 16 k through 12 schools reaching over 8 000 students by the year 2020 in weed re4 school district in windsor colorado they pledged to bring cs to all schools in the entire district let's go to michigan where utica community schools is implementing a new cs curriculum in all 11 secondary schools during the 2018 school year which will reach approximately 10 000 students and here in california the riverside district will offer at least one cs course at every high school in the district and the val verde unified school district will bring computer science to all 12 elementary schools and all comprehensive high schools in the district and last but not least in the la unified school district where i grew up in pledges to provide a cs education for 100 of their students by the year 2025. and we have more in austin texas the school district has pledged to reach all students with cs courses by 2019 and across the country boston public schools will teach cs in all 130 schools over the next three years and that's not the only school district that's going to reach all of their students in compton they're bringing cs to every single k12 school and in fontana they are going to offer cs at every high school and launch it across the elementary schools dallas is also making great strides in elementary schools and by 2020 the dallas district has pledged to bring cs to all 150 elementary schools and in nearby fort worth they're going even further in this coming school year not only is the castleberry district providing a comprehensive cs pathway for their 4 000 students but they're also going to make sure that every student has internet access at home can we get a round of applause for all of those districts and the other districts making pledges today to bring computer science now in addition to the 70 school districts there are over 50 nonprofits and universities who are making pledges this week to prepare new middle and high school teachers to begin teaching cs in 2018. again we're going to go through hold your applause we're just going to share some highlights and i'd like to kick it off with cheryl in hawaii women in technology pledges to prepare 60 cs teachers in 2018 in colorado mine spark learning and colorado education initiative are adding another 128 to that number marquette university in wisconsin is going to prepare 160 teachers and our count goes up by 180 with the michigan mathematics and science center network a few more in west virginia university they pledged to prepare 128 teachers by 2018 and here in the bay area alameda county office of education contra costa county office of education and the silicon valley education foundation will add another 146 teachers to their roles the friday institute north carolina will reach 165 teachers and finally next tech in indiana adds 192 teachers keep adding if you're keeping track in dallas the university of texas will be preparing another 96 in illinois luminese adding 118. in arizona the grand canyon university and science foundation arizona are preparing an additional 120 and across montana wyoming and north and south dakota the america campaign and thai will add 384 new teachers now those were just a few examples across all the organizations pledging to prepare new middle and high school teachers we have 4 500 new teachers who are going to begin teaching computer science this year they will reach over 200 000 students every year can we get a round of applause for all of these organizations and it goes beyond professional learning many organizations are doing other work to support computer science including building new courses for these students some highlights who are making announcements today include bootstrap who with support from nsf and bloomberg is creating a new introductory data science course code hs which will launch a new cyber security course and the microbit education foundation which is announcing the release of new lesson plans aligned to code.org's cs fundamentals curriculum many companies are also innovating in how they teach their cs courses for example codeable is announcing it will develop an adaptive learning platform in 2018 using smart data and machine learning to allow every child to learn at their level and according to their interests these organizations and companies are also reaching out to new students and teachers and this is one of my favorites code combat is pledging to expand their partnership with the center for educational excellence and alternative settings to run coding competitions in juvenile justice facilities in 2018 they will teach coding to 1 500 students across 16 juvenile justice facilities and the national math and science initiative is also making an important pledge today to offer ap computer science principles in all high schools they support through their college readiness program by 2021 and given the popularity and just general awesomeness of scratch this is a big one the scratch ed team is pledging to engage over 3 000 educators in participatory professional learning experiences this year adding it up on top of the 70 school districts we have 100 organizations making pledges today let's give them all a round of applause and we're still not done the examples we heard so far were all inside the united states this initiative is worldwide and this movement is global we have announcements from around the world and cheryl do you want to share a couple of them in canada kids code genus and the foundation csdm pledged to bring cs to 28 000 students from ages 8 to 12. in italy program il futuro pledges to bring cs education to 2 million students in italian schools this is a good kind of long speech right i'll think of all this value the malaysia digital economy corporation will work with malaysia's ministry of education to build an educator support group for 30 000 computer science teachers so important and lastly the ecuador ministry of education announced its new digital education agenda which includes a plan to establish cs as a foundational subject in the national curriculum in mexico quantrex and funduscan fundacion televisa are pledging to bring cs to 500 schools and 1 000 teachers and they are launching technolocos mexico an initiative to inspire and include mexican girls and young women in computer science in the uk the government has committed 100 million pounds to its 2018 budget to train 8 000 new computer science teachers in secondary schools and to establish a new national center for computing education now those were just some examples the full list includes 20 announcements from countries around the world pledging support for programs that will cumulatively prepare 20 000 new cs teachers and teach over 2 million students around the world you get a round of applause for all of the organizations around the world and i want to thank you both for coming up and sharing all of these they're going to come back in a few minutes but thank you next up we were supposed to have kimberly bryant come she had to cancel last minute um but i wanted to say a couple words on her behalf about the work that black girls code is doing uh kimberly brown bryant is the founder and executive director of black girls code and they are reaching students girls of color across the country and as part of cs education week they are also going to reach out to new students across the country to help them be introduced to computer science so get a round of applause for black girls code now while we celebrate the work of the entire community here for computer science education week i also want to make some announcements specifically on behalf of code.org i want to recognize organizations that are announcing new multimillion dollar donations to code.org to support teachers and schools teaching computer science with an emphasis on diversity as part of their access your potential commitment pwc pledges three million dollars for a threeyear sponsorship with code.org to support teacher workshops for the cs fundamentals cs discoveries and cs principles programs and the creation of a customized middle school technology curriculum the middle school curriculum will be launched in december and provide an introduction to technology skills and the careers they can lead to the bill and melinda gates foundation and the infosys foundation are also renewing their support for computer science the combined gifts from today's new pledges including the bill and melinda gates foundation infosys and pwc adds up to 12 million dollars in new funding thank you so much for your donations can get a round of applause for these excellent organizations and i'm also pleased to announce that just this week code.org hit a major milestone we just passed 10 million girls who have created accounts on our platform and to put that in perspective that's a lot of girls to put that in perspective cheryl was talking about the lack of diversity in our universities if just one percent of the girls who coded on code.org in the last year were to go on and study computer science in college that would more than make up for the gender gap that we have today so uh you know and the work that this has come from is really all due to the teachers um who are bringing this to our classroom every day so i want to one last round of applause to those teachers who have introduced 10 million girls to computer science and we're almost done with our announcements and we saved the best for last we heard about all the international governments doing work for computer science and i'm glad to let you know that right here in the u.s we also have governments making new policies for computer science to tell us more about this i'd like to introduce cameron wilson he's our chief operating officer and the president of the code.org advocacy coalition thank you alice i appreciate the chance to be here this morning the movement to bring computer science into our schools uh also means we need to update state policies to sustain this momentum for years to come policy leaders incl increasingly recognize every student should have the opportunity to take high quality computer science in k12 this will unlock innovation opportunity and economic growth in their communities and enable students regardless of their gender race or background to participate in our rapidly growing digital economy and at a time when our country is divided this issue can also heal this divide political leaders from both major parties are working together to pass computer science policies as a result in the past four years 40 states have enacted policies to expand computer science education and i am pleased to announce new policy pledges this week from states to expand k12 computer science governor scott in florida has pledged 15 million dollars for k12 computer science professional development for the state's teachers the hawaiian state department of education is committed to a process to review and update its k12 computer science standards and today the governors of alabama montana pennsylvania north dakota and indiana are all joining the governor's partnership for k12 computer science education this bipartisan coalition of governors now 14 strong are all committed to working toward three goals in their states first that at least every high school will offer a computer science course second there will be funding for professional learning for computer science teachers third that the state will have rigorous k12 computer science standards and now i'm pleased to introduce three governors who couldn't be here today but wanted to send a personal message by video with their new commitments to this movement hi this is governor asa hutchinson of the great state of arkansas from the moment my 11 year old granddaughter helped me to understand the importance of computer science for our future it has been a priority for me in the first month of my administration arkansas became the first state in the nation to require all public high schools to teach computer coding with the support of anthony owen my director of computer science and our educators statewide arkansas continues to lead the way in computer coding education one of our highly successful initiatives was to provide two thousand dollars stipends for high school teachers to learn to teach coding the enrollment in coding classes has increased dramatically teacher preparation is key to any successful educational initiative so with that success under our wings i am pleased to announce that arkansas is allocating five hundred thousand dollars of its computer science initiative budget to fund a first of its kind program to provide a two thousand dollar stipend for elementary and middle school teachers who train to become computer science lead teachers i'm proud to lead the state that is leading the way in computer science in his schools thank you hi i'm steve bullock governor montana montana's technology sector continues to grow we're seeing an increased demand for workers trained in computer science fields it's projected we'll need to fill nearly 30 000 computer science jobs over these next 10 years at the same time more and more jobs in all sectors require employees with strong problem solving and critical thinking skills that are integral to stem and computer science training we're serious about preparing montana students for these high demand and high paying jobs which is why i'm pleased to announce my commitment to join governors for computer science as part of this commitment we're ramping up our efforts to develop comprehensive k12 computer science standards provide high quality professional development and training for teachers as well and will ensure that every montana student has access to computer science coursework i want to thank all those participated in computer science education week for shining a light on this important topic as we work to ensure equity of opportunity for all montana students thanks so much good morning i'm governor eric holcomb throughout our 200 year history indiana has embraced innovation and we're proud to be the home of such cuttingedge companies like eli lilly cook and cummins and today we are one of the fastest growing states for tech employment indiana knows that computer science is a foundational subject that touches all areas of study and fields of work and we are proud to be one of the first states to embed computer science in our k through 8 standards but we need to continue to expand access to help ensure that all hoosiers are equipped with the tools they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving economy that's why i am proud to announce that a key piece of my 2018 next level agenda is to require all k through 12 schools across indiana to offer computer science by 2021 and that we provide the resources necessary for professional development so that we have the teachers in the classroom that will allow us to meet this goal i am also pleased to announce that i am joining the governors for computer science partnership a bipartisan initiative to promote computer science education in schools across the country i look forward to working with my colleagues to help advocate for policies that expand computer science education thank you for all you're doing to support computer science education i'm excited for what this means for the future of our state let's give a round of applause for our uh state level commitments we really appreciate entire states getting behind this movement so thank you so since we're in california for this kickoff we're very excited to have one of the state's top leaders with us today lieutenant governor gavin newsom is here to help share what steps california is taking to expand computer science education for every student lieutenant governor newsom was elected as lieutenant governor of california in 2010 after serving as mayor of san francisco for eight years as a member of the san francisco board of supervisors and then as mayor of san francisco and now as lieutenant governor of california who's been in leadership for a long time in the state new lieutenant governor newsom has been a national leader on issues of equity the environment homelessness healthcare policies he has initiated and implemented have been duplicated in cities across the united states now as lieutenant governor and in his role as the university uh as a university of california regent and cal state university trustee he's pushing to expand computer science education in our universities and k12 classrooms so please provide a warm round of applause in welcoming lieutenant governor newsom to the stage so i guess you guys did that purposely you rub it in with arkansas and indiana which trust me that ain't easy sitting here listening to those governors get ahead of california i i'm going to spare montana because i got married there and my daughter's name montana but i admire and appreciate their leadership and the question is where's california we've got to step up our game we haven't been out front we love to say about our state the future happened future happened here first but not as it relates to requiring computer science in all of our high schools we're actually trailing we've been falling behind and as you all know in a world where tech is racing ahead if education falls behind where does that leave us with more acuity in terms of wealth gaps more acuity in terms of income gaps more questions about the issues of social mobility the issues that i would argue disproportionately will define our times not as a way to begrudge other people's success but as a framework of a paradigm a gap that must be mined particularly in california the wealthiest and the poorest state in america eight million people i want to remind you living below the poverty line in the state of california when you look at the supplemental poverty index no state has more children living below the poverty line in the state of california this bifurcated hybrid reality a coastal economy and one struggling in the inland part of the state disproportionately so rather than lamenting about it we're here doing something about it and i want to just congratulate peggy and susan and cheryl code.org the great work of julie and access and all the enlightened leadership in this room for forcing us to get our act together to get out front and to advance an initiative we call cs4ca and that's simply this a goal a very comprehensive goal at scale respectfully the governors of those other states at scale to require cs in every high school in the state of california by 2025. we can achieve that and we are now committed to achieving that the governor just signed a bill i know program passing is not problem solving but we passed at least a commitment to establish a framework a strategic framework to implement a strategy with equity at the foundational principle of a paradigm 27 that's the number of girls that took ap computer science last year that's it just 27 of the 10 plus thousand people that took it in 2016 and this is jawdropping less than 150 africanamericans 10 plus thousand people took ap computer science in the state of california less than 150 were africanamerican but less than 1500 by the way latino it's a majority minority state cannot have this conversation without having the question of equity being front and center that's the question we need to answer that's the question that will define our success or failure in these initiatives so we're going to step up our game we're going to make financial commitments we've got audacious goals that we will reach we have the core competency reflected in the work that all of you have been doing on this issue and we have the imperative in closing and that is the recognition that the plumbing of the world is radically changed you all know this we're going from something old to something new someone described it the other day as paralysis contrasted by rebirth when they described the taxicab industry versus uber and lyft and others it's a world where we ain't seen nothing yet you know that better than i the combinatorial nature of technology the stacking of technologies what's happening in this space is going to create conditions where the urgency of this moment cannot be underscored and so i just want to again compliment all of you for your guidance your wisdom your faith devotion to cause for problem solving uh and for the innovative spirit that defines the best of this state it's time to move away from downloading apps to have our kids start designing apps moving away from just plain on your phone to start actually programming that phone that's the spirit of this moment that's the spirit of this movement and that's a spirit that defines at least my modest participation uh here today thank you all very very much wow it's uh great to see states competing with each other to uh outdo each other for computer science uh we like to foster that competitive the competitive spirit of code.org so we appreciate the commitments to california now we want to recognize the amazing work that's really being done at the heart of this movement the organizations schools teachers and students and to kick things off for this recognition i'd like to introduce deborah seahorne deborah is the interim executive director of the computer science teachers association this is a great association we've had a partnership for years with that really represents the field of computer science teachers out there and has previously led the association standards work as well as serving on the csta board of directors from 2013 uh to 2015. she's a former teacher and is an education consultant for the north carolina department of instruction please welcome debra to the stage isn't this amazing the podium moves up and down for our short people thank you cameron and good morning champions for computer science guests and friends of computer science education happy computer science education week on behalf of the computer science teachers association i welcome you to the inaugural csta and code.org champions for computer science awards as cameron mentioned csta is a membership organization that supports and promotes the teaching of computer science and other computing disciplines at the k12 level it is particularly gratifying for csta to be a part of recognizing these tremendous computer science accomplishments we stand in awe of the incredible achievements that these awardees have made in computer science education there were so many outstanding achievements submitted that the elect selection committee for the awards had a great deal of difficulty in selecting the winners the students teachers schools school districts and organizations that we are recognizing today are the best of the best they are truly broadening participation in computer science advocating for computer science innovating and making an impact in their community you are an awesome group and we salute you for your accomplishments now i'd like to invite susan cheryl and peggy to please come back to the stage to help me recognize our champions for computer science award winners when we asked for nominations for these awards we were amazed to receive close

podium to present the school award okay so i'm pleased to announce there's four winners from across the country as our school champions for computer science eufaula high school in alabama arkansas school for mathematics sciences and the arts brennam high school in texas and anacapa middle school here in california accepting the awards on behalf of their schools we have lee calton corey alderdice trenton hall and christy steinlich and while we can't highlight all the great accomplishments of these schools i do want to take a second to specifically talk about the work being done at eufaula high because they've more than tripled their cs enrollment in the last year and they've done it with equity in mind female enrollment increased by 233 percent and minority enrollment by 800 percent so thank you all and i get to present the computer science the champions for computer science to teachers we all know how important teachers can be this to diane neville from gulfstream academy of hallandale beach in hallandale beach florida which is so close to where i grew up uh for broadening participation in computer science to heather surkowski from crac mont montessori magnet school in hartford connecticut for her work in advocacy to efrin lopez from jw nixon high school in laredo texas for the impact you're making in your community and to lawrence ramos from the emerson community charter middle school in los angeles california for innovation lawrence is a special education teacher who learned the principles of cs education and started a coding school in his class congratulations again we all know how important teachers can be to this and we're super grateful to all of you for all you've done okay and finally i am pleased to announce the student student champions for computer science let's name a few of them vidi srivastava angela joanna garcia pena and shreya shagar so let's please join me in congratulating and giving a huge round of applause for these incredible leaders teachers and students for all of their contributions to computer science all right and now we have a very special demo that crystal and angela are going to do today we're going to call them up here on stage so using an adafruit board crystal and angela developed a gps connected wrist brand which when paired with their mobile app helps parents monitor their young children they have been featured in la opinion and telemundo so let's welcome these two budding entrepreneurs and watch their demo come on up what if you were a teenager that had a race coming up but couldn't practice throughout the week or on the weekends because your parents were overprotective well i don't have a device's hearing parents less awkward and more cool but what i do have is a device that lets your parents know where you are when you're for a jog this way your parents will know that you indeed are running and nothing else it alerts your parents if you ever feel unsafe about your surroundings or location and it is waterproof i mean come on that deserves a round of applause and for you ladies that want to track your husbands this works too okay so i i actually thought about this idea when i was laying in bed thinking to myself oh how am i going to survive running 26.2 miles without getting extra practicing i asked my mom if she could go out and roam with me but she was tired from coming home from work and wouldn't um and didn't let me run by myself because she thought our neighbor our neighborhood was unsafe so that's how i came up with find you might be thinking what is the find you app well it is an app that connects to our wristband which every wristband has a unique code you enter and you only have to log in once and we also pair it up with google maps to find your wristband's exact location hi my name is angela garcia and i'm the founder hi my name is crystal reynaga and i'm the ceo of find you run free you're shaking dude i'm shaking thank you angela and crystal i think you guys are ready to go into business right now so that's awesome can we get another round of applause for them thank you so much thank you and finally to kick off cs education week we have a special special message from melinda gates i wanted to be with you in person especially after i saw the program what an amazing group of leaders but i'm grateful for the opportunity to thank every single teacher mentor and policy maker who is helping students fall in love with computers and technology you're changing lives and i know that's true because i still remember the teacher who changed my life mrs bauer in 1982 she saw the apple ii computer at a math teachers conference and she persuaded the head of our school to buy one and then inspired me to imagine a different future that kind of inspiration and imagination is even more important today than it was back in the 1980s computer literacy is now an essential skill along with reading writing and arithmetic every student and i mean every student needs to learn his or her way around a computer but computer science education does even more than change lives it also changes the world it gives young people the power to build the future and the more we encourage different kinds of people to get interested in technology the better that future will be innovation happens when we approach urgent challenges from every different point of view bringing women and underrepresented minorities into the field guarantees that we see the full range of solutions to the real problems that people face in the world so one of the reasons i'm so optimistic about the future is that technology can make the impossible possible but only if we're all involved in the effort and that's what cs education is all about i hope you're leaving this event feeling motivated there's a big bright future waiting for our young women and young men together we can help them seize it thank you and with that i think we can all say that computer science education week is officially kicked off in the one hour we have been here hundreds of thousands of students around the world have begun their first hour of code in their classroom so i want to say thank you to all of the classrooms joining us over the live stream and i want to wish you all a happy computer science education week and now if you're in the room i also want to let you know that we've got a computer science curriculum showcase with 17 curriculum and professional development partners you're all welcome to go check it out it's right over there and learn about different ways that you can bring computer science to your school or classroom thank you all for joining us maybe we'll get it done you
