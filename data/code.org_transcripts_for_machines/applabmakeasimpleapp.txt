hi i'm isabella and me and my friends are starting a fashion company called metamorphos and we take your old rip clothes and turn them into new accessories in addition to the website we wanted to make an app using app lab and i'm going to show you how i made that so now i'm already in the code mode so i'm going to go up here and switch to design so now it shows me all of these buttons that i can choose to put pull in pull and drag and i can change the background color so i'm gonna click on this and choose a color that i like for the background so how about this color right here and now i'm going to name the screen so that i know what it's going to be called so i'm going to call this the home it's in catalog the home screen so now i'm going to drag this text box on and i can change the text over here to say the title of what i want this to be called so now and i can also over here scroll down and change the font size okay and i can also change where the text is by dragging it so now i'm also going to add an image so i'm going to just pull this image on and then i can here and go to picture and hit choose so now i can upload a file so now i can hit choose and there's my image so i'm going to center it and there so now i'm going to add some more text so i'm just going to pull this text box over and say not going to finish because that was too long to type so so now that i have this screen i'm going to add a new screen so it's going to be my donate screen so i'm going to drag this text on and call it donate and i'm also going to make the font size bigger and drag it a little bit so now i'm going to also change the background color to a different color and this page is going to be different because it's going to have a quick survey like thing so i'm going to actually use these radio buttons because that allows you that makes sure that the user only checks one instead of both at the same time unlike a checks box check check box and so i'm gonna you have to create a group id so that they only check one so i'm gonna call this survey and same on the other one and i'm also gonna rename this to just be radio button one and do the same the other okay radio button 2 and survey so i'm also going to make a question so would you donate your clothes to us so now i'm gonna also put the answers so they could either say yes or no so this will be yes yes and this one will say no no so so now you're going to add a button that says submit or whatever you want so that when they choose either yes or no they have a they can submit it and then it will take them to a new page so if you hit so for right now i'm gonna do two pages so if they say yes i'm going to add a new screen and it will be like a thank you screen so we'll say thanks for your input then i'm going to also do it first i have to name this so this is if they say yes yes and then i'm going to add another screen and if they say no so so i'm going to call this no then this screen is going to be like green and this will say maybe next time i'm also going to make this bigger now that i have this all set up i'm going to do the code so i'm going to drag this on event when button 4 is clicked i'm going to go to control and say if and then uh can't find it oh here if get checked if radio radio button one gets checked then set the screen to screen yes because radio button one is the one if they said check yes then you're going to add a plus down here and then so then you're going to do the same thing so if get checked here it is but then this one is radio button two button two gets if so if radio button two gets checked i'm going to set the screen to the no screen so now this should work so next we're going to do the drop down so that you can change between the different pages so i'm gonna go to home first so you're gonna just drag this drop down on and option one okay so you can change the option so option one should be home then donate and you don't want to have the option to yes or no because that is based off of the survey so i'm going to call this drop down one so then you're gonna also add one on the donate page so that you can get back to home so option one and option two okay so home and donate and i'm gonna call this drop down too so now you're gonna go back into code so now that i've added the drop down we're going to make the codes so that it actually changes between the different pages so i'm going to drag this on event so if drop down 1 is changed then you're going to go to control so if so basically if what so if what they if drop down 1 equals donate for example then you want to set the screen to the donate screen so set screen and donate so then you're also going to want to do this on the other donate page but for the opposite for the home so an easy way to do this is if you go to the text you can just copy and then you're going to copy this down here and i'm just going to go to block mode and change these so instead of drop down 1 you want drop down 2 and you want it to equal home and then set screen to home so now you're just going to run this to see if this works so i'm going to hit run oh look it's on the home page let's go to donate it worked now would you done it you're close to us i'm going to say yes and submit thanks for your input this is a simple twopage app in the future you could also use this data button up here which allows you to view the data so that you can actually store the data that the user inputs so if you actually want to share your app you can click the share button and type in a phone number and there it is on my phone
