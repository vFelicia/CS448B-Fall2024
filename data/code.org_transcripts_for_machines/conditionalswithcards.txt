this activity can be a little bit confusing so i'm going to make a little animation to help you through here's how this game is played there are two teams team one and team two each team will draw a card during the round and see according to the conditionals how many points that either they get or they will be awarding to the other team first it's team one's turn for round one they draw a three of spades if you come up to the conditionals you'll see where it says if card is lower than five and this card is lower than five so we're going to go into that if statement and now there are two more statements inside there so we need to look at the top one if card is black it is black which means we go into that if statement and we award your team which is team one the same number of points on the card that gives them three points once we have found a condition that satisfies our situation we get to ignore everything else so we don't worry about any other rules now it's team two's turn they draw a seven of hearts so we go up to the grid and we look and we see if card is lower than five well this card is not lower than five which means we ignore this entire section that means that we need to go into this else statement at the bottom now inside the else statement is another conditional and it says if cart is hearts and it is that means we go in and we award your team which is team two one point so at the end of the round team one has three points and team two has one for round two team one draws a four of hearts we come back to the conditionals if card is less than five and it is which means we go into the if statement if card is black it's not so we're going to ignore that if statement it does not matter to us because our card is not black so we go to the else statement inside that if statement and it says award other team one point which means for this round team one doesn't get anything and they have already contributed one point to team two now team two draws their card and they get a four of clubs so the card is lower than five and just like team one's first pick it is also black which means they award their team team two the same number of points on the card which is four now they already had two points we're going to add the four giving them six points for round two now we draw for round three team one draws a nine of clubs nine is not lower than five so we ignore that entire section up top come down to the else and it says if card is hearts award your team one point it's not hearts which means there is no condition satisfying this card which means there are no points awarded for this round that leaves team one with a score of three at the end of the game it's now team two's turn they draw a five of diamonds now if the card is lower than five well five is not lower than five so we ignore that entire top statement and we come down to the bottom else it says if card is hearts and this is not hearts it's red but it's not hard so we ignore that statement as well which also means there are no statements that match our card which means there are no more points awarded this round that leaves us with the six points we already had and team two wins the game six to three
