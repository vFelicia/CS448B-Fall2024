hi everybody hello welcome to your first hour of code I hope everybody's doing well this has been an amazingly exciting week for me at my organization code org is at you know we're barely one and a half years old or about to turn two years old and about three or four months it's incredible to see how far we as an organization of come but even with this campaign the hour of code we just launched it one year ago today's it's this week we're celebrating its second year and as of today we've already had 70 million students try one hour of code that's an unbelievable number all of this week every day of the week 5 million students each day have tried the hour of code and you know what what started as an idea just about 16 17 months ago has now blossomed into a campaign that is touching every single country in the world students in every language from every demographic in every age group all behind the simple idea that learning how computers work on the inside and learning how not only to use technology but how to create technology is something that everybody can learn no matter how old you are it's been so exciting to create something that has had such an impact and I'm so happy to share this moment with you at and I guess I'm open to questions as so should we start with Amy Beecham from David leader middle school and Ontario hi Amy sure and so the question is what inspired me to study computer science and how did I feel the first timer I realized I was good at it at so I grew up in Tehran Iran Iran is you know in the Middle East and when I was growing up there was actually during a war with Iraq it was not a good time to be living in that country there your fighter planes bombing our neighborhood every every evening and so I wasn't necessarily inspired to learn computer science as much as my it was there was not that much else to do my dad one day brought home a computer and back then this is like 30 years ago computers with these giant things and he said this doesn't have any games on it it doesn't have any programs on it but here's a book and if you want to have fun you can teach yourself and so I learned it how to do it from a book and you know what was amazing once I became good at it that what I really felt was empowered I felt that I can change whatever I want you know there's this you know there's a special feeling when you can think of something and dream it and imagine and that actually create it and see the thing that you created turn out the way you wanted that and that that is a great feeling you know when you're getting started you're not exactly sure what can this computer do or I make mistakes and I figure out how to fix them but when you finally see your imagination reflected in something that's on the screen that's the best feeling in the world right next question from Katie Frederick's school Clinton middle school in Clinton Michigan hi I'm Mikayla Fletcher and this is Ashley gauge our dance we're from Clinton middle school and Michigan and here's a question why are people so afraid of coding when it's everywhere that's a really good question at you know I actually don't think people are afraid of coding anymore i think in the last two years we've completely changed that you know if you ask people to three years ago they just assumed coding must be like calculus or rocket science or just as crazy thing that you know is meant only for the geniuses and that's because movies and television shows show pictures of these like you know boys in a basement drinking like energy drinks or if ones and zeros flashing across the screen and that and they just have this image of like the really weird genius coder and the reason is the people making those movies and making those TV shows they didn't learn it themselves it's not being taught in school and so they use their imagination for who's this type of student who does coding now that we've had 70 million students including you know middle school girls elementary school boys of all colors and backgrounds do it I think it's safe to say that it's no longer scary but but it's traditionally been held back by a stereotype you know when I was in school basically being good at coding was the nerdiest least popular thing you could possibly do so I was basically the biggest nerd in my school by far but at this point I think you know we've had people like will.i.am say that coders are the new rock stars and you know people who create the apps that we use in our daily lives there they're like superheroes in this country so i think it's no longer scary and it's no longer unpopular it's just a question of who can get good at it quickly enough add next question from New Jersey okay read the name of the school so from Tina jasoos class and Montgomery High School and skillman New Jersey hi I'm Mike running her and we are Montgomery High School so our question is in your opinion what is the best way to pursue a career in computer science as you know there's many actually different ways to pursue a career in computer science at you know this is a unique field you know the standard way to pursue any career is to go to college to get a degree in it and then find a job and this you know that is probably still the standard way that's how I got into it I studied it in college I got a job at Microsoft in the relatively early days of that company and you know right now in this country about 40,000 students a year graduate from America's colleges with a degree in computer science so think that's 40,000 students but each year there's a hundred and forty thousand new jobs in computer science that's that's a huge mismatch between the jobs and the students there's so many more jobs that people need to get into this field that don't actually come out of college or more students need to go to college and study computer science but what's cool about this field is you don't actually need to college degree to be great at computer programming and there's so few people learning it but there's lots of people that get hired dropping out of college or even skipping college if they get really good and all the top college courses in computer science are actually available online as well I don't think there's any other field that has so many successful college dropouts and I'm not suggesting anybody here avoid college or drop out of college but I'm just pointing out if there's a single field that you could get good at and either skip or drop out of college it's this one it basically because the computer doesn't recognize if you're black or white if you're a girl or a boy or if you have a computer if you have a college degree or not the computer just does what you tell it to do and if you know how to tell it to do things that are amazing and that blow people away you can get hired frankly no matter what I actually my first job as a computer programmer was when I was ninth grade that was 15 years old it was actually illegal for them to hire me because I was too young to get a to get paid for work and I didn't tell them my age that but you know that was the beginning of my career you know at a time when my fellow students were working or actually my fellow students weren't even working because we're too young had that you know one year later other students would work in gas stations or things like that I was by far the best paid kid in my school I was I still wasn't popular at all but I was getting paid very well because I could do computer programming as well as any of the other adults good at so as long as you work on it you can learn it at home where you can learn it at school it's a fantastic career at that said the reason code org is teaching kids this isn't if we go into the careers it's because even if you want to become a doctor in 20 years you're going to need to know how technology works if you want to become a lawyer a politician a pilot no matter what you want to get into every single field is getting turned upside down by technology if you want to become a chemist the Nobel Prize winner in chemistry last year was a computer scientist if you want to study birds the biggest advancement in understanding how birds fly was made by computer scientists and I can give many many examples but you know I'm sure nobody here in this room is a budding ornithologist wanting to study birds but whatever it is you want to get into at technology is changing the world so much that's really important to understand I write the next question from Atlanta Georgia from Lori smith's class of the charter middle school hey I'm will would and um from PG charter middle school and our question is what kind of jobs are available for people who are both creative and computer science that's a great question your computer science is in naturally creative field there's some jobs where somebody says this is exactly what I want yeah the thing i want to make to look like and can you just coat it up and those jobs are sort of you know the more good you get that's more like taking dictation most computer scientists or software engineers are given kind of an openended problem and they build near they combine creativity and problem solving at once your computer science is one of the few fields that's like a match is like a cross section between art class and math class because you have to do both things at once at certainly game design is an easy option to think of you know every single computer game out there is being made by people who are both good at writing code and creative at thinking about what are the things that could be done but I code but outside of game design the people making almost all the movie effects every single movie watch these days at least some of it was made by computers and computer programs and you know the animated films you see from Pixar or Disney or places like that the entire movie was made by computers and again the people doing that you know if you if you watch the movie frozen and also shoots ice out of her hands or you watch The Hobbit movie or the lord of the rings movies and the dragon is breathing fire there's somebody there who's actually figuring out how can we use a computer how could we create something that's never been seen before in the real world fire coming out of the dragon's mouth or ice coming out of a woman's hands you're you're thinking creatively you know that's not something you're modeling at over the real world but you're creating a computer model of what that should look like and then running an algorithm that traces every point of light that would hit this computer model to then create you know every single frame of one of those scenes is made by a computer program and then the model changes then you make your next frame so that there's a lot of different fields that are getting changed by computer science all of them involve not just problem solving but also the creative side as well mmm next question for Liz Whitney's class ridge crest elementary school and shoreline Washington that's really close to where I live hi guys we can't hear you so now we can hear you okay welcome what is your favorite app and why this is a tough question because I'm going to make you know all the other apps that aren't my favorite going to be unhappy if I if I pick one favorite but you know the one app that I probably get most happy when I use it and and you know you guys are in elementary school so you might not be familiar with this is an app called uber and what uber is for is for calling a car to go from one place to another and i travel a whole lot for code or I probably once or twice every week I'm in a new city and so I don't have my car with me and what I used to do is I would rent a car when I'm in a new city but then I have to learn the city and you know always deal with driving directions and so on and calling a taxi isn't very easy either I've both uber I can just say this is where I want to go it actually comes straight out of my calendar and two minutes later a car picks up they already know the destination they know where I am the GPS and the phone tells the car where I am and my calendar tells them where I want to go and so I don't really need to think about it this car just comes and picks me up yeah and one of the reasons why that's my favorite app is because you know most people think of technology in the format of games or like an Xbox or a website and it's all digital and it doesn't connect to the physical world what we're going to see in the next 20 years is a lot more technology connecting the digital world of your phone or your website to the physical world of automobiles or airplanes or other things that you see in life and you know one day the uber app should be able to call you click it and get a car and the car doesn't even have a driver in it you know there's there's people who are working out on cars that drive themselves so one day I should be able to touch on my phone and said I want a car to come to my house a car shows up with no driver it already knows where I want to go and takes me there I'm thinking about technology that is something that expands beyond phones and tablets and PCs and xboxes to think about it as touching everything you see around your world is part of why this is an exciting field and that's also part of why the uber app is one of my favorites because it really ties those things together I don't know how to explain that question very well I'm from UM from the yep from the Bedford charter foreigners studies at Northridge California hi my name is Caitlin and I go to Bedford Elementary I live in Los Angeles and my question for you is what's another startup you you enjoyed working on in why either at it well it's great to hear from um I've worked with a whole lot of startups you know I started to my own startups one of which was quite successful one of which was kind of a failure but you know some of the most fun I've had is working as an advisor investor out with different startups and to the startups I've had the most fun working with when they're very very small our Facebook and Dropbox and none of those I think Dropbox probably was the one that was the most fun with for me now how many people here know what drop boxes does anybody notice okay a handful you know so you know those of you who use if you use computers you know every time you're using a computer a lot of what you create as documents and files that you save on your computer Dropbox lets you save all of your stuff whether it's your photos documents files emails somewhere on dropbox of services with even if you lose your computer or you switch computers or you want to get your stuff when you're on your mobile phone it's available anywhere at the reason that was fun for me isn't just because of what they built but because I got involved when it was only two people that the company was two people in the product had only just started and now it's been almost seven years the company is a few hundred people but they have 300 million users using their service and it's like a multibillion dollar major success story and watching a company go from just two people to to a few hundred and seeing it going value to create tens of billions of dollars of value in just seven years has been amazing and this is one of the amazing things about technology is that you can see very small groups of people make a ton of impact and also a ton of money at you know many of you here may use whatsapp I wasn't personally involved with what's up for that company you know it's like 50 people made it you know too founders started the team became just 50 people they sold it for 19 billion dollars it's amazing to see how quickly these companies can grow and drop box on the startups I've been involved it was going to one of the fastest growing and most fulfilling for me to see em the other startup I did which was really fun my own startup I like was in the music space that wasn't nearly as successful is probably my least successful endeavor but one thing that was really fun about it was it was in the music space and by working in music I got to meet a lot of really cool I guess artists and musicians and so a lot of people that were personally my own favorite artists and musicians I got to meet because I was running a music company you know I like was a predecessor of Spotify and Pandora if you used those services now it was a similar space but I think before its time and the company wasn't successful but getting to hang out with all these cool musicians was pretty neat am pride from Valerie de paolis class in fenton Michigan from Boyd Arthur middle school hello my name is Brendan snows and I then this is void Arthur's middle school my question is what qualities and skills you look for in the people that work at code.org hi Brendan that's a really fantastic question code.org has a lot of different types of people you know we have software engineers that make things like the Angry Birds puzzle or the honor and Elsa sort of hour of code activities and all the sort of tutorials that are online and those people are computer programmers they studied computer science in college and they you know they can build any website or any app but they're working here to build our website and our apps and then we also have teachers there's a whole bunch of computer science teachers that left their own school to come work for us and they're actually kind of sad because they wish they could be teaching students but what they're really doing is helping us create curriculum that then rolls out and reaches millions of students so that you know as they aren't in the classroom anymore but their vehicle org teaching millions of students at you know the the thing we probably looked the most foreign all of our employees is I guess an empowerment and a sense of ability to change you know its most people when they do a job they have kind of a fixed roll like this is what we need you to do and it's going to be the same thing every week for a year for many years at code.org things are moving so fast that nobody knows what their job is going to be in three months if if you know we've only been around for 18 months if somebody had told us 18 months ago that we would reach 70 million users and that we'd change laws in 16 different states and we'd be in partnerships with all these school districts we you know nobody would have believed it and had half the things we do we come up with one week and then two months later it's not an entire initiative as so probably adaptability is the the top thing we look for that if you expect the job where the job is the same every day of the year at code.org is the wrong place to look for because we're moving too fast and things are changing too frequently um I think one last question is from Barbara quarless school east cobb middle school in Marietta Georgia hello my name's a keen Lauren has never been shy and more familiar back in east cobb middle school and um and our question for you is how is how do you see computer science impact in the future hi yes sir oh that's great i don't know if you know i'm an identical twin brother i'm an identical twin as well I I can't tell if you guys are identical or not it's really a fun having a twin growing up I certainly enjoyed it a lot in terms of how computer science and technology impacts the future you know first of all I'd say you guys are living in a unique time when half the stuff that you take for granted is stuff that only 10 years ago people thought wow that's the future you know and usually when people talk about the future they think like what's going to happen on in a hundred years or in 50 years right now just even thinking five years ahead there's incredible things that are happening you know I think within the next let's say 30 40 years technology pure science is going to change so much in our world I mentioned earlier about not just cars that drive themselves but you want you don't need to own a car it can drive itself and in that kind of a world you know trucks can be able to drive themselves cargo ships should be able to drive themselves there's a whole lot of industries involving transportation that are going to be disrupted when you don't need as many humans think about when a cargo ship goes across the ocean there's a lot of expense with all the sailors on board there's a lot of danger and risk what if something happens and you know I think within 10 years we're going to see giant cargo ships that have nobody on them you just put them in the water and they go and they get to their destination and that's that's transportation in one place medicine is going to change a whole lot there's research already you know most of you see you know robots as kind of toys but robots are changing all sorts of things around us and in medicine people are already researching robots that are so small they're smaller than a cell that you can put in your body like you know inject them with like a needle and inject like a hundred thousand little robots into your body that then go around and cure diseases so people are researching how many here how many people here know what a white blood cell is so most of you should know what do I blood salads from your biology classes you know what a white blood cell does it learns how to fight disease but it needs some time to learn that and you know you need to get vaccinated which teaches your white blood cell but sometimes diseases you can't get over cuz your white blood cell its can't fight it or your immune system is weak so researchers are looking into basically computerbased robots that are so small that can do it the job of a white blood cell and download the cure to a disease off the internet and then start curing it inside your body I mean that's mindblowing that's so different than you know the games you use on your iPad but the software inside that robot is built the exact same way and you know so I think maybe not in my lifetime but certainly in your guys lifetime you should see a day when all the popular diseases that everybody is getting you don't need to cure them by drinking more water or staying in or resting you cure them by downloading the cure straight into the robots body and I think you know as an example of change that's a pretty big change in our lives at you know another area of change is going to be construction how many people here have heard of 3d printers and so that looks like a lot of your you know so today 3d printers are these things they're about like this size and they can print these tiny little plasticky you know statuettes or so on and you don't think of a 3d printer is something that builds something useful that you use in your daytoday life do you think of a 3d printer or something to build a little statuette that looks kind of cute and neat but it's not sort of gamechanging at but there's not people that are building gigantic 3d printers that can 3d print an entire house so you know instead of bringing our construction crew and laying bricks and foundation and you know chopping wood or whatever there's places where they have an entire 3d printer it's a housesized 3d printer that comes in they pour concrete into it and they pour like a bunch of materials in it and then it just lays foundation throws the walls up put something like the you know curtains whatever then again and then they roll it away and there's a house that was just built with no crew you know that that actually is happening today that's not in some sort of dream or lab there's actually one or two 3d printed houses in the Netherlands that people are living in that wasn't created by any humans who was created by a gigantic 3d printer these types of things I think are right around the corner by the time some of you kids are in college or just out of college so much is going to change in your lives whether in transportation construction medicine that dear one amazing thing about technology is if you can dream it it's pretty much possible it's just a matter of time that's not been the case in almost any other field that we think of but you know if you can imagine a computer doing it it kind of cannons there's a question of how long does it get until the hardware is fast enough until a computer program is is smart enough and that's part of why co.org is trying to get everybody to learn this field because no matter what you go into no matter what job you want or what career you want what area of research it's going to get changed over the next 20 years by technology and if you're not on top of it or not following it or not learning how technology works you're going to get left behind and you know in the 21st century that's that's not a really good thing yeah we're done with questions would add nobody asks a question about I don't even know if you guys even know that this happened but about one of the things that was probably the most unique thing that happened in not just in my week but in my life so how many people here have already done the hour of code has anybody done it already are you all just about to start all right so a lot of you have done the hour of code how many of you have done the the frozen themed one with Anna and Elsa drawing the ice fractals all right a lot of people did that one too um classes all clapping so there's one really special person that also did that exact same set of tutorials earlier this week and let me get his picture um so that's the president of the United States of doing the hour of code using the same exact frozen tutorial that many of you guys did you know the code that he rode was to get Elsa to draw a little square wasn't really complicated you know move forward turn right move for turn right eight times no sorry four times to draw a square but you know it's the very first time a president of the United States has written code and you know the reason it's the first time a president the united state has written code isn't because it's because you know mostly as presidents just it didn't exist when they were in school the average president is 50 60 70 years old and computers didn't exist when they were in school and so this president has decided you know even if I'm 53 years old even presidents should know how technology works if you're if you're a president of a country part of your job is setting the laws about how does the internet work how does music piracy how should that get regulated you know how do we protect our country from cyber warfare and people who are sort of hackers that are attacking our banks or so on and even if you want to become a president or senator understanding that technology is important if you want to regulate or be reinvented defense of the country um but more importantly he wanted to inspire kids to say no matter whether you're black or white or older at this is a field he can get into um the coolest thing about him doing it and I'll show the picture again at this hat that he's wearing is literally this one at not one like it but this specific hat had so I think I'm one of the only people in the world who was actually wearing something that's been on the on the head of the president at before so we were hoping he would keep the hat but at he left it behind so I got to keep it for myself M which is probably the one of the coolest personal things that came out of this whole experience you know starting an organization just as an idea a year and a half ago co.org started as a hobby for me I don't even know where was going to go I just thought I'd get started this seems interesting and seeing one year and a half later my own hat on the head of the president has been an incredible incredible journey and I wanted to actually thank all the teachers in this room for this for your support of computer science at what we do at Cobourg it's been incredible what you do for our children and thank you all and I hope you continue learning don't just do one hour at the point of one hour of code is just to realize that you can do it you know everybody in this country and in every country realizes technology is changing things you see things like Minecraft or Instagram or snapchat or whatever it is you use in your daily life your favorite things in the world are made by computer programmers and everybody knows that those people are getting wealthy you see billionaires all the wealthiest people in the world these days are these like college dropouts who started a company and it became facebook and now they have like thirty six billion dollars nobody needs to be told that that stuff is important but what most of you don't realize is that you can do it nobody needs to be told that it would be amazing to be the next Mark Zuckerberg who creates the next Facebook but most people don't realize that you could be that next Mark Zuckerberg and the whole point of the hour of code is just to get you realize that it's not as hard as you think but you need to stick with it so one hour isn't enough so at beyond your first hour please please try to stick with this field even if you don't become a computer program on you want to become a doctor please stick with it and thank you so much for your time and for your support you
