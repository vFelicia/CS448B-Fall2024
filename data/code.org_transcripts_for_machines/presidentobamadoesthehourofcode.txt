(President Barack Obama) Hello everybody! How you doing? [Raw Video Hour of Code at the White House, December 8 2014] Good to see you, what's your name? Nice to see you. I just want to say to everybody, Code.org is doing some incredible work and I'm so proud of the young people who are here today who came down from New Jersey on a big field trip. All across the country, people are doing code. We're starting too late, when it comes to making sure that our young people are familiar not just with how to play a video game, but how to create a video game. (student) Right here it tells you that you have to move forward. (Obama) Okay you gotta slow down, because I'm an old man. So what's going on? Because of Code.org, because of collaboration with schools, and because of these outstanding students somebody in this room I suspect is going to come up with an outstanding new game or new device or something that I won't be able to figure out but Malia and Sasha will be able to teach me how to use it. (Vice President Joe Biden) Girls can do anything! Anything, anything, anything! Don't let anybody tell you you can't. (Obama) Don't give up. And don't just say, "Well, I'm not good at it. I'm just not going to do it." You gotta make sure that you stay with it, and that's what teachers are there for. Alright? I'm proud of you guys. Special thanks to President Obama and all of the White House staff.
