Have you ever thought of math not just as a way to calculate numbers but to communicate ideas? Just like English, Spanish or Chinese, math is a language, a way to talk to others. When we speak, we use nouns like bread, tomato, mustard and cheese to describe things. And verbs like toast, cut and melt to describe actions. Math is the same way, using numbers like 1, 2 and 3 to describe things and operators like addition and subtraction to describe actions that you can do to those things. Just as you can toast a piece of bread, a person can also add four and five. Let's get familiar with how to program in Code Studio. Your screen is split into three main parts. On the left, is the play area where your program will be evaluated. The instructions for level are written below. This middle area is the toolbox. Each of these blocks is part of our math programming language. Later on, we'll many views of blocks in each menu item. The white space on the right is called the work space. This is where we'll build our program. To link blocks together, drag them out to your work space and drop them next to each other. When you see the yellow arrow, they'll snap together. If you want to delete a block, you can drag it back to the toolbox. When your program is ready, you can hit the run button over here. After your program has been evaluated, you can hit reset to get back to the beginning. Have fun programming! Subtitles by the Amara.org community
