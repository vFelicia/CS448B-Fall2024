hi i'm miranda i work on the amazon future engineer program and today we brought 15 of our amazon future engineer interns to code.org to help them build hour of code dance party backgrounds all of us have been working on p5.js trying to figure out how to create nice little designs for the backgrounds i'm doing a whole bunch of different stars that are going to all like spread out in cool ways so that kids all around the world can have more cool backgrounds to play with so that they can keep learning and getting inspired by computer science a lot of creativity happening a lot of code a lot of fun happening i think with the afe program um they're definitely been very supportive so it feels like there's really someone there who cares about you and is looking out for you so it's been a lot of fun i have learned so much in this past summer i've gotten exposed to what it actually is to be a software development engineer it's really cool being able to take what you learned in a like classroom setting and applying it to like real world stuff computer science isn't just like tech or like stem it's problem solving it's figuring out ways to do things before that no one has thought of yet some people think you'd be a genius to like get it and understand it and it's so far from the truth honestly computer science is so broad that whatever you care about whatever you're passionate about you can make that happen it's really exciting to see all the different opportunities and all the things i can go into if i want to computer science changed my life computer science is the reason why i'm able to intern at amazon today computer science is for everyone change the world start with an hour of code
