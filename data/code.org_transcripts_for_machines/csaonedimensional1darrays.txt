i'm emily and i'm a senior software engineer at axon i'm currently building 911 dispatch software computer science is such a quickly evolving field that you will never be bored because some genius across the world came up with this an amazing idea that i get to use now there's always a new thing around the corner what if we had to store a lot of values so many values that it isn't practical to create a variable to manage each one individually arrays are one solution to this problem well what are arrays arrays are linear structures that store one or more values of the same data type imagine a bike rack bike racks have a fixed number of slots this one has four slots each slot can only hold one type of object a bike you can't park a tractor in this bike array we would need to put that tractor in its own tractor array let's see how we can use arrays when coding in java we can create a raise with the following steps first we write the data type which can be a primitive like an into our double or a reference like an object then we add square brackets then we add a variable name for the array after the assignment operator we add new data type this must match the type of data chosen earlier following this again we write square brackets this time with a length in between the two brackets the length is important because arrays are immutable this means that the structural parts the length and the data type cannot be changed just like the bike rack our array has a set number of spaces to store data together these spaces are called an index in java an index starts at zero and goes up it ends at the length of the array minus one arrays allow us to store multiple values of the same type together with one variable
