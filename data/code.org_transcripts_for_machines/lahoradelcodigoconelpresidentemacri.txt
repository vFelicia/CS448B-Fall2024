Programming, although it could seem like people get sucked into it, it also helps us. It is very important for the fact of how it is changing how people spend time. You can learn more about technology because as the years pass, the whole city, the whole country is going to be automated. In school we do many activities, programs on Arduino boards, we use different programs like PSeInt, Python, Scratch, Sublime, all of the ones like that are for programming. Very happy, proud, to be here in the Casa Rosada presenting a new video from Code.org to encourage that young people, in addition to using technology, learn to create it. Microsoft the the primary supporter of this organization and what we are looking for above all is for students to learn computer science and that the curriculum is changed in all of the countries in Latin America. Argentina is the first country in South America, and in all of the Americas, that is going to change the curriculum to teach computer science, programming, and robotics to all students in all grades. It is a very important change. We had an experience with the president. We taught him how to use Code, which is a page where you can create games, applications, or web pages like we are using in school. And it was quite educational. We showed him the different functions or options that we had to program different things, what corresponds with each function, and it was quite educational. We got a lot out of it. The experience helped me a lot. When I finish school, I would like to have a telephone company or to be able to program video games. I don’t know...it’s between a robotic engineer or being an artist.
