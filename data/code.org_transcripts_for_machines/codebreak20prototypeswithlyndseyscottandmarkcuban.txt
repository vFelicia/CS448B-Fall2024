hi everybody welcome to code break my name is Hadi partovi I'm calling from code.org headquarters here in our studio actually no I'm just at home let me change up my virtual background this is my living room and I'm joined with my daughter Sofia Sofia's gonna be the sound board manager and we're joined here with a whole bunch of folks there's about 1200 people find it on zoom' already and last week we had 10,000 viewers streaming live on facebook and there's people joining him as we as we're talking still about 10 or 20 per per second last week we had 10,000 viewers joining from places as far away as India and Spain and Greece Israel and Azerbaijan at all hours of the night thank you we're hoping together to build the world's largest live interactive classroom if you enjoy what we do here today please invite others to join as well if each one of you invites to two other parents or families to join we should hopefully be able to double every single week I want to introduce our first special guest today Lindsay Scott who's a actress model and also an awesome software engineer Lindsay how are you doing I'm doing well and yeah thanks for asking how are things in Los Angeles they're good I've been home obviously quarantined but I've enjoyed being home I think it's nice to have this time to be at home and maybe learn something new or or try something normally would have that time to do lots you want to share what the millions of students are at home without school oh yes I think that code code org especially is a great way for you to maybe spend your time and you can spend the next couple weeks in quarantine or however long it takes and then you could come out with a great new skill set so you yourself have been successful both as a model and an actress but I'm most interested in your computer science background can you share about how you got into computer science and what you're doing with it sure so I went into Amherst College knowing that I wanted to act but dropped my time there I made my way into computer science class and I loved it so much that I ended up double majoring in both theatre and computer science alright and now it's perfect I'm able to program from home here in LA and then normally go out and act and it's been a great way to find my acting career while I'm trying to work through that that's great yeah Lindsay's got an incredible reputation as a software engineer and in fact on stackoverflow which is one of the top websites for coders to ask questions and answers she has all sorts of questions that people ask her about iOS engineering and making apps which he's done a lot of I would say you're kidding yeah that's good you want to introduce all right so before we start we're gonna do a joke of the day or computer joke of the day so Lindsay why was the computer cold I don't know why was it called hi to all the other students for joining us around the country so who you can switch to gal or review and we're gonna unmute everybody so if you could hey Brian what's up alright so the next thing we wanted to do is you want to say hello to the audience who's not on camp right everybody can see you have a chat button on your screen if you're on a tablet or phone you may need to tap the screen to see it if you click the chat what you need to do is to click the little blue drop down that says and choose to all panelists and attendees and this way you can type in there and everybody can see it if you could all tell us where are you from and where people are from Illinois Tennessee Puerto Rico Nevada Florida let's see other countries Orlando Memphis Bellevue awesome now can people also type what what grade they're from Lebanon Honduras you type in your grade fifth grade fourth grade okay third first and third oh wow and so then the last thing I want to ask if people couldn't have twenty fifth grade I so want to get a sense of people's computer science experience if you could type in either one if you're a beginner too if you're intermediate three if you're advanced okay seems like we have a good mix some some people are four wow we're gonna have an opportunity to hear from today so you do all three different levels so we're gonna start with much more beginner stuff as we go along I want to give people let you know that there's a button for Q&A so if you have any questions as we go along you can click this button and those questions will come to the a team at code Oracle try to answer them in real time and we'll get hopefully a chance later in the episode to answer one or two questions live and for today the agenda we have is we're going to talk about prototyping and we're gonna start learning about first designing an app or designing on paper second we're gonna build an interactive card and then lastly we're gonna do rapid app design those are the sort of three stages of what we're gonna be doing and as we go through this I also want to call out this is our second time hosting code break it is not a simple thing to pull together with such a large live audience we have almost twice as many people today as we had last week if we run into problems we're gonna learn an important computer science concept called debugging and this is a bug that's Sophia Drew and so when we run into bugs we'll just deal with them if we have tech issues if people have trouble calling in etc um so I want to start by showing some of the things that the students who joined us last week submitted we asked for people to we learned about algorithms and how to make art using code and so many people shared your drawings to social media and I want to share some of these on my screen so this this one is from Lycia tattoo Lee and this was a whole team of 20 kids in Milan Italy that drew these different shapes and she said even if we're locked down in our houses we had fun so thank you Lisa for calling in from Italy and this other one I want to show is from our Nabi swass his daughters Miren Lanie and share Anya sent in these two drawings and then they've been coding all week making different drawings Arnab are you there with us right now can we are not to just say hi briefly with his daughters they're Ron's onion Malini how are you doing great um so it's great to see you and they're calling they're dialing in from Bangalore India what time is it in there in Bangalore right now it's 1040 right now 1040 in the night well thank you for joining us so today's computer science word of the day is prototype today Thank You Sofia for this design we're gonna learn how prototype starting with design on paper but Lindsey since you've made so many apps what do you do when you are making an app have you ever started by prototyping in some other tool before you get started yeah definitely prototyping is a great way to work out what your app will look like or do before you put too much energy into it it's a great way to show clients or or customers what you have to look forward to and hopefully they like it too before you get started alright so I want to show sort of a view of an example of an end result what we're gonna do today is prototype and then build an interactive card this here if you see my screen is an example of what the end result will look like and let me see I'm not sure if it's showing for people yet oops that's my whole screen let me come back and do it differently all right this is what an example of an interactive card would look like that we're gonna build so you have a little bear here that you need to feed and you can click on different food for him so you can eat the watermelon or you can eat the hamburger and he gets bigger as he eats food each time we click on something the bear gets bigger and finally he says happy crow break and we fed the bear it's a very simple card with a background in a character and then reacts to different behaviors we're gonna make a similar interactive card right now but we're gonna start by designing it on paper first so I want to show the example of what it's gonna end up looking like and now we want to have a number of students basically join us to help Lindsay design her cards so can we welcome David Lana and Claudia you're all gonna be now unmuted so you can say hello so David are you there yeah me hello where are you from where we go Oh Puerto Rico okay so what grade are you in six ever done computer programming before well they give it they give it for a grade here in school as technology teacher so where are you from sorry my animals just made a little noise fighting in the background where did you say you're from Massachusetts we're in Massachusetts okay I went to school in Massachusetts that's why I asked so what grade are you in and what's your favorite subject in school reading in Sophie are you with us as well yeah hi I Sophie are you and Bellevue Washington I'll be Washington and what grade are you in I'm a ninth grade okay nice high school so how how are you enjoying your quarantine is there something fun you've been up to uh I've been in and out my business Wow yeah business yeah I'm a fashion bad company oh wow well that's a great way to spend time at home you know so inspiring to be able to have your own business at your age that's amazing all right so now we're gonna switch to going to the prototypes of Lindsay we want you to start by asking the folks who are on screen they see questions to basically help do you design a card so and for everybody else who's calling in if you have a paper and pen please draw along with Lindsay so we're gonna draw the card in the top part of your paper and those have you heard live on camera you can do the same as well there go ahead Lindsay okay so let's see first we need to figure out what the background should be so should it be a city a farm a desert underwater a rainbow with Sun any ideas you guys can type type it in the chat underwater underwater people really seem to like this underwater idea so but that's very hard to draw space that's a good one um let's do the rainbow yes I can I can draw a rainbow okay and so next what type of characters or objects should we put on the card we can have a person an alien a bunny a cow a crab a fish car kangaroo anything I see some things miss chat but do we have any ideas also from our panelists panelists um David or Ilana or Claudia do you guys have any thoughts on that it may be like a Martian Martian okay I like that and it seems like some people in the chat of s'en said alien 2 so so that works we'll have a rainbow and an alien oh gosh I need to draw an alien okay well while I'm working on that so what the next thing we need to figure out is what happens when we tap be alien actually let's come up with two objects there's the alien and what else let's figure out one more object they see a lot of people saying cats so we'll do a cat and an alien with a rainbow in the back so what happens when we talk that alien or cat it can they can move they can jitter they can wander around they could spin I can say something any ideas panelist someone a chat dude maybe like do like a default dance like somebody said here like in for an eye or something unfortunately the program we're gonna use doesn't have that kind of capability but I'm sure you guys can create that in current sometime later okay so we'll have them alien spin and the other creature we chose maybe like teleport or something Oh teleport now we can't do that either unfortunately but we can make them move walk around say something maybe maybe I should say something anybody have an idea for what the cat can stay first thing it doesn't have to be meow happy birthday April Fool's Day okay yeah that's good alright so the cat will say so I'm going to write down these behaviors at the bottom of my card and I guess well I'll do that you haven't have any trivia for me hottie so so Lindsey's basically your drawing to write down basically what's gonna happen in terms of the code that we're gonna do so she's saying that when the alien is clicked you want the alien to do some spinning and when the cap is clicked you want the clap cat to say happy April Fool's Day and you're writing this down basically just to keep notes of / want to create in code and the reason to do this on pen and paper the first is to plan out what you're gonna do in code it's it's easy when you're in code to basically make mistakes and then get stuck and then change your code as you go when you write down a plan in advance you can then basically organize your thoughts and once you're coming on the computer you have a clear idea of what you want to build now for something this simple you don't necessarily need to do that but it helps to organize your thoughts and it dance to do this then there are you close enough to done to show us your finished paper yes here's my rainbow my alien and my cat and then it says and I think it says in reverse on camera but what it says here it says when alien is clicked it spins but cat says have an April Fool's Day win it scratch and Sophia did you make it yourself to show yours so if you do something very similar all the other students on the camera so we can see and hold up if you made drawings what you made all right so we're gonna next jump into coding to actually create something that does something like this and thank you David Lana and Sophie for joining us in a few minutes we're gonna learn how to pattern this paper prototype into an interactive card that Lindsey can share but first I want to give me just one second first we want to do trivia time Sophie are you ready for today's trivia question alright so we're gonna open a poll for everybody to take a trueandfalse question you're gonna see a pole pop up on your screen if you're following on facebook live or some other platform you won't but today's question is a true or false question true or false the term bug or debugging was first used by Admiral Grace Hopper who found a reallife bug stuck inside a compiler in the 1940s so we're gonna keep the poll open answer the poll all right can we get the results of the poll up on the screen for everybody to see all right so it looks like 75% of you said that the answer is true and 25% of you said the answer is false correct answer is false even though Grace Hopper is known for having popularized the term bug or debugging both terms that existed before as far back as Thomas Edison in the 1870s and throughout the 1900s at bugs in those words were used in the context of flaws and engineering or robotics that predated modern computers but grace ha the first recorded incident were an actual reallife bug a moth got stuck inside a computer and caused a problem because she was such a well renowned computer scientist for the work that she did in in innovation with compilers she desi has been known as a person who popularized the term all right so now we're gonna switch to having some real code written and my sidekick Sophia is gonna be the one doing the coding and Lindsay's gonna be instructed in Sophia how to basically create the interactive card that we saw I'm gonna start by sharing Sophia's screen Sophie are you ready yep he was born ready all right so now we see Sophia's screen and Lindsey are you ready to give Sophia instructions if Lindsey's on mute can we unmute Lindsey so I'm gonna explain what we see on the screen on the left side of the screen here is where the card is gonna be made on the middle are the commands that Sophia can use and these are in different categories like world sprites etc and the right side over here is what are we gonna make her code Lindsey's a computer scientist so she does she works in much harder tools than this but she spent the night last night to learn this tool to help teach it to Sophia so go ahead Lindsey Oh Lindsay is still muted can somebody unmute Lindsay all right yes there we go okay perfect so when run we're going to when run is tapped we want to create a background so go to world and we're going to set the background you can drag it into the project underneath run there we go and then we're going to change that to tap the down arrow or tap city and we're going to change that to rainbow let's do a rainbow with Sun I think there's a rainbow with Sun option okay well rainbow works too oh nice and next we're going to add the sprites which are the objects so tap sprites underneath the blocks menu and you're going to make a new sprite so drag that into the project and this sprite is an alien so pinyin can you change out an alien alright that's alien like and to change the position of the alien tap the pin next to the 200 200 and then you can move it around wherever you want and it'll change the coordinates for you in the code alright that looks good and we're going to add one more sprite so go back to sprites and next we're going to add so drag in the make new sprite yeah and you're going to change that to cat and if you don't see a cat here for anyone who needs help you could tap more at the bottom and tap animals and you should be able to find a cat here yep so tap the cat and then go back to the down arrow and you can find the cat in that menu there you go and again you could tap the pin and move the object around so now that we've got the scene in place the next step is to react when the objects are clicked so when the alien is clicked it's going to spin in order to do this you're going to go to the events menu and drag in the when clicked and you're going to actually put it separate from the other code because it happens not one app when the project runs but when the items clicked so you could change that to the alien great and we're going to add a behavior so go to the b58 behaviors and let's find the behavior of spinning either left or right I think either works oh one more thing back in behaviors scroll up and you're going to add the sprite begins to connect the click action to the spinning action and then put the spinning when the click action ian's perfect now I'm change that sprite object to the alien so when the alien is clicked the alien will spin left now let's try running it now to see what happens okay well that aliens actually spinning kind of fast for its own liking we don't want it to get sick so let's press the edit button stop the project press the edit button and let's slow down that spin by by cutting down a number of degrees it it goes for each timer cycle so let's change any of the behaviors that you actually see so Sophia you can change the speed of the spin here yeah so you could change that number ten to one let's be gentle to this alien perfect okay now let's try running that again much better all right let's stop it for now and then we're gonna add the one last action the cat saying happy April Fool's Day so back in the events menu drag in a click action change that to cat and then the options have print something actually is in the world menu so top world and you could dry again print and put it right on your with clicked when clicked and you can type in happy happy April Fool's Day perfect ok so now that everything's in place we can build and run what build run normally I build and run because I have to compile the estimate run then you can click them and see you do the pieces yeah and now we can click happy April Fool's Day it says it at the top and one last thing I want to do just for them more advanced people in the top right corner there's a code button so let's take a look at what we did in code and the top right of the workspace there we go so that's real code underneath all of that action pretty cool so this is the JavaScript code behind everything that we did includes the blocks that we dragged out but it also includes the definitions of the various behaviors as well as you can see spinning is defined as how it's done so behind all these blocks there's real JavaScript and even though draganddrop coding is the way people start learning it as you get more experience you end up using sort of a typed programming language or you need to type in the code the capabilities are very very similar and it's more about thinking how you want to put your code interactions together what we built here today was relatively simple there's a lot more actions a lot more types of events and a whole lot of types of behaviors for what you can do with with it making an interactive card and when you're done making your card you can click the share button and then you get a link to the card that you can share and send to a friend you can send it to a phone or did send it to your mom or dad's phone to get that your interactive card on your phone if you have an account on Facebook or Twitter you can post it to social media and so basically after you're done making your creation you can share it and at the end of this episode we're gonna email all of you the information for how to make your own card and we'd love for you to share where you create and then on next week's show we're gonna showcase the best things people created so next I want to see if we have any questions for Lindsey let me stop doing my screen share and if you remember we have the option for doing Q&A now it's a good time for Chad apps don't I have to use Swift or iOS programming um that's a good question gets a bit more advanced but I'm definitely going to answer it um so with the programming idea you can either use Swift which is Apple's programming language or you could use objectivec which is the older language that was originally the only language you could use for iOS development so yeah now I normally code in Swift you normally code in Swift whoa you later today is using a code or a tool called app lab which is great for prototyping it doesn't create iOS apps it creates what's called web apps the benefit of web apps is that you can see them on your phone very quickly and you can see the minoan page on any kind of phone rather than the the process of building a real iOS app has a lot of extra steps and you also need a more powerful computer and you can only actually do it on a on a Mac I believe partition Drive and into the computer but yeah I mean that's a great way I need to check out this tool before I you know get into the hard coding definitely a good way to prototype sounds like um and Akira or a person from coder is on the line as well to ask students from the the broader audience that I've used the cuny but Mercure are you there I am Hadi hi how are you all so we have a question for both Hadi and Lindsey first why do you both like coding so much what drew you to the field for me it felt like soon as I got at the class I was just so excited I was raising my hand all the time because it felt like I was playing logic games so even now it still feels like I'm solving these little logic games and then I end up with this masterpiece at the end of creating exactly what I wanted to create to begin with it's very exciting to me I got into coding when I was growing up in Iran and this was actually during the iraniraq war it was a terrible place to grow up my neighborhood was getting bombed every single night so I we spent every night in the basement holding our ears hoping in your house wasn't gonna get destroyed by the bombing but so for me the computer that my dad brought my back home for my brother and I was our one escaped from a really terrible whole world and we learned how to code on that and then when we came to the United States as immigrants my family didn't have a lot of money but it as as early as 14 years old I started interning at tech companies and so for me back then coding was their way to is he make extra money and took help our family get our lives started in the in a new country as immigrants but really the beauty of computer science and the reason I started org is not just because you can get jobs as a code because the creativity because it helps teach you how to think and even if you don't want to get into computer science as a career it helps give you an understand how the world around you works everything around us is increasingly impacted by technology and the confidence of knowing you can build that own technology yourself you understand how it works you can program the world rather than having it will program you is something that every student should have the opportunity to learn yeah that's one thing I love about programming is that any interest you have can be made better by technology and to have the tools to build ask really powerful and Lindsay we have one more question for you before you go this person said you're successful in so many fields during actress your model your computer scientist you basically do it all what advice would you have for a young coder who is also interested in other things how if you learned to balance all of your priorities yeah I've been really lucky so at a certain point I was modeling and it was so time zooming that was all I could do but then I I moved out to LA to focus on my acting and in order to focus on it I knew that I had to make some money from doing something and so that's when I started doing client work for different app companies and so it's have been great that I've been able to make a living from doing that and support my acting work but it's also been great that I've been able to use my interest in acting to inspire some of the apps that I created like I just created this self tape app crackers and it's just nice to have that perfect meshing of my interest and my skill set thank you so much Lindsay and thank you hi thank you and if we could switch to gallery view and give a chance for everybody to say goodbye to Lindsay thank you so much for joining us Lindsay know you're allowed to stay on if you want to I wasn't sure if your time is emitted we'd love to have wonderful well then you can get to see how Apple AB works as well so Thank You Lindsay now we're gonna welcome our next special guest Mark Cuban needs no introduction and we are so lucky to have him on the second episode of code break market I'm here with my daughter Sophia they said yeah but you doesn't students you see on camera there's about 1,700 students live on zoom' and on Facebook we're gonna have on the order of 10 to 20,000 folks watching the live stream as well guys I'm hanging in there you know it's fascinating listening to your story howdy growing up and what you had to deal with because it's relevant to what people are going through today I mean we've tried to teach my are kids who are 10 13 and 16 now you may think this is bad but what others have gone through this is this is nothing I mean to wake up to bombs and not know if your buildings still going to be there or where you're going to live it's you know it's it's a lesson of resilience that I'm glad you could share with us thank you for folks in the audience if you have questions for mark again use the Q&A button and we're going to have a chance to have some of those questions answered when you type your question please enter your name and also where you're from so we can call let outs so marked 90% of the students in the world are now studying home alone do you have any words of inspiration or encouragement for them you know this is the chance you have if there's something you really like to do to try to be great at it you know I started going back on the piano which I haven't been in years you know just picking up some of my favorite songs and and annoying my kids and my wife but you know Reed picking up books that that I wanted to get to whatever it may be however you learn what a great time to learn absolutely and you know the first you're so well known for the work on Shark Tank and also for you know for owning a basketball team but the very first companies that you started as businesses were tech companies can you tell us more about those and how you got one of my first jobs out of college was working with for a software company way back when and I could started a company called micro solutions in the 80s and we were one of the very first companies to connect pcs together when back then people thought there was no need to connect a PC together I'll just carry my floppy disk from this PC to that PC and so I started doing local area networks I taught myself to code I didn't have a technical background but the way I always looked at technology was that there's the the person who developed it whether it was software or hardware then there was everybody else so I was effectively tied for second place and if I worked hard to learn it then I can learn it as well as everybody maybe even as much as the original developer and that gave me an edge to be able to apply to different businesses and that's how I grew that business and then after I sold that took a few years having fun and then in the mid 90s when the internet was starting to take off I felt a friend of mine from college Todd Wagner and I decided you know what this new internet thing there's got to be a way we could do audio over the internet so we can listen to Indiana basketball and effectively we had the first streaming business in the country in the world and that was a company called audio net and you know it was it was an early early version of what we're doing right now yeah that's great so you know learning computer science is what we're here about and it's obviously part of how you got your early starts there's about a hundred thousand students in the country right now they're taking a course called compete science principles and for many of them they're taking as an Advanced Placement course for credit and in that course one of the things you work up to is to build and prototype an app that as something that you build by the end of the course and the students who take that course and use a tool called a pleb for their prototyping and in fact the AP exam unlike most AP exams which are like a multiplechoice test and just QA you actually to submit the app you create to the College Board and your graded not only on your coding but also in your creativity it's a wonderful course that's great if there's any high school students in the audience if your high school offers CS principles you should take the class and if it doesn't I hope you incurred your principal to ask added to the class schedule with help from code org so for the next segment we've selected three students to pitch their app ideas right it is like Shark Tank but there's a there's a twist there they're gonna pitch you their ideas they're gonna get your feedback but for the choice of what which app we're gonna pick we're gonna let the entire audience choose one winner I like it I like it a lot cool about this since our word of today is prototype what we're gonna do is we're gonna let the audience choose the winning idea and then we're gonna prototype it today live in code I'm no we're gonna prototype in live in code if you have a phone separate from the screen you're watching on you'll be able to get it right on your phone by the end of the hour I'm not sure that's ever been done before it's our first time doing everything here so forgive us so we've now selected three students to pitch their app ideas to get their feedback from mark and we've got so many amazing student submissions by the way since we announced this on Friday I made the time to look at all of them myself and I was blown away the the three we picked one is that I thought we could prototype in real time because we want to teach you how to make an app and coding it live so nicely for you to hear from students give them come the idea I'm gonna introduce the students my daughter Sophia is going to manage the one minute timer if people she's ready set go and if people go over she's gonna make a sound so if you do you have a sound Sophie do you wanna practice your sound first time sound and then mark after each pitch we wanted to ask probing questions getting back have them have a chance to talk with you so first we have Yasmine and I'm Tara from Nevada and Yasmine is gonna present Yasmine are you there with us ready set go did you know that 57% of Generation Z doesn't know what they have in their savings pod the savings will fix that our app is it financing how about teaches young adults how to manage their expenses through a reward system last summer I added difficult time managing my finances I I didn't have the organizational skills needed to create a balanced budget as I spoke to my peers I realized an same problems as me as young adults were given many new financial responsibilities that I'm a new financial responsibility but do not have time or skills to create balanced budgets this app divides your salary to different categories that you choose such as housing and food and each category you set a price range and if you stay within the price range you earn points but if you exceed it you lose points and once you accumulate a Sarah mad appointee to win prizes such as gift cards and quokka merchandise this reward system is used to UM to make saving more fun for our users and ultimately prepare the youth for fully entering the consumer world thank you I wish you could teach all the Shark Tank contestants to go that fast and be that's the thing it's a great idea now there's a lot of competition out there there's others elders that deal with budgeting but I think if you hear the app towards a younger audience like who's watching today then there's a real need for financial education because to your point most kids don't understand it and even a lot of adults don't understand it so the question I would have is what kind of learning modules would you include so that kids can under two so that kids can learn more about finance and how it works so in our app um it's going to automatically so it's gonna divide your seven different categories that we based on so we're gonna have I heard the percent rule but I it might have been like the 30 20 10 I forgot but in terms of distribution of where you put your money how you saved your money right right and that's good so but I think think the key to this is really working partnering with some folks that can provide you a lot of educational materials right because it's hard to put together a budget if you don't know what each category stands for you know it makes it more difficult so just and the second question is will you be able to retrieve specific category amounts from someone's bank account or are you looking for them to enter it manually sir looking for them to enter it enter their own categories manually and will sync up the purchases they make with their being counts so they have a good transportation category it's gonna show that purchase history with like your gas and your insurance bill and everything like that so you got it yeah right so let's switch to our next app which is from Paige from Texas Paige are you there with us can we unmute Paige I paint Sofia you want to kick her off are you ready I'm ready whenever you are ready set go kids love repetitive games my app uses repetition by asking the user to input one good thing about themselves per day the first time the user does this a small tree is planted but each time they enter a compliment to themselves it grows as the user gets into the app they'll start to receive notifications of positive impacts the tree has on the community like being able to provide shade on a sunny day not only does the repetition allow the kid to have the habit or reform the habit of good selfconfidence but the symbolism of the tree shows that our own selfconfidence positively impacts the world around us this can be used by parents kids teachers and counts to show kids that we can build our own selfconfidence and have the tools we need to succeed that's great I think it's a great idea how are you looking to code it look what tools were you looking to use so my I'm in a computer science class right now and we're in mobile app in gaming and definitely like Hadi said using a web app just so it was more accessible for people to get into it but then also easier for me to code just because web coding is a little bit easier than Swift how are you like daily inspirations to people to get them excited and remind them to continue to use the app how I guess the better question is how are you going to how are you going to incent them to continue to use it I like the reinforcement of the tree but sometimes people need to be reminded sure so I would probably if I'm using a web app I would set up an email system just so you know daily they would get an email or they could opt out of that if they feel they're comfortable but definitely an email system and maybe adding things to the tree every once in a while like cherried making it a cherry blossom on a certain day you know just so they're excited to come back will you allow perhaps like Instagram oh absolutely I like it I like I like the idea thank you alright so the third student is Trisha from Pennsylvania as Trish that we're gonna unmute you so you get a chance to introduce yourself and Sophia's gonna give you your ready set go or you are you there with us Trisha I am here I trace on hi okay three two one go hi my name is Trisha and I'm a junior at the Episcopal Academy right outside of Philadelphia it is my passion to save the mother earth that inspired me to start a save the planet Club in my sophomore year and it had an overwhelming response however I always had one issue when approached by one of my peers who asked how they can help in this global issue I was only able to give responses that benefited my local community due to a lack of centralized global data the homepage of my app lists sustainability issues such as ocean pollution depletion and deforestation the user can click one of these issues and will be taken to a page that specifies the broader concept for instance ocean pollution the next step is plastic or Wildlife as interested the user can select any one of these options each with their own facts and figures page and resources to directly aid each issue this format and many others can be provided for a variety of global problems including Koba 19 and provides a succinct platform to make a change Oh God so effectively you want to be a home page for all things related to sustainability for the planet essentially there are like different options hopefully so you can pick what you are interested in an 8 in that ok and how will you source all the data that you'll present so a lot of these come from rabbul sources so UN has a bunch of great sources as does NASA and I think if we collect data from those sites that are incredibly reliable then the information will come together very quickly how will you make that connection will you how do you think you'll be able to automate it are there api's to your sources do you know yet I I don't okay I'm hoping that it will become clear once that's all put together in one place yeah cuz I think it could be really cool if the data updates in real time so it gives people a reason to go back all the time right because that's the hard part sustaining their interest in the app but it's a cool idea congratulations thank you so much I want to thank all three of the panelists for your ideas and I wanted to say also again that like I said earlier we had so many amazing submissions from students it was so hard to pick the three that we picked and part of why we picked them is so that we could wrap it prototype them so now we want to let the audience choose between these three app ideas and to see which one we're gonna rapid prototype we're gonna put a poll on the screen so everybody should get a chance to vote for different screens that hole might take a little longer to take and for those who are watching a little Facebook live livestream it might be a little bit of you well you won't see the poll that will show you the results afterwards all right so the votes are coming in I can see them but we haven't shared them yet there's I think I see a winner already but it's a tight contest I don't want to share the results here until we have more votes in so Paige well let me vote you guys would let me fall down bad we didn't want to put too much pressure on the students it's okay all right I think we're ready to share the results of the vote do you all see them can we share these out to the screen there's a tight contest wow that is really tight thank you so much to the other contestants and Paige if you could stick around because we're gonna want your help for actually designing your app obviously everybody can stay online but we're gonna mute folks we also have before we switch to the live coding and Mark since you're short on time we were gonna do the coding parts after you hang up with us both yeah a little bit of time for some additional Q&A for mark so students from home if you remember you can submit your question using the Q&A box we're gonna take two questions quickly because mark is short on time and congratulations to Paige it was a great app Paige you were my favorite I kind of liked the way it turned out all right so so here's one from mark he says or a question for mark a student says I'm eight and I invest with my grandparents do you have any advice for how to weight or invest now how do I learn from this as a great question that is a great question first I say watch Shark Tank on Friday nights on ABC because you'll learn about all different kinds of businesses because the key to investing in the stock market is understanding the company that you're going to invest in there's there's no real easy way that's why people make and lose money but at eight years old I would tell you look at the companies that you like to use you know maybe if you're a gamer what companies are into gamey but find the companies that you like and if you think they're really popular check to see if their stocks for them and dip your toe and then in 30 years 40 years you'll be dealing with all right another questions didn't ask if the student has a great app idea and has a paper or coded prototype where do they go to get it to the next level and this is finger right this one right here you learn you learn how to code you know and you're old enough to learn how to code and to prototype it and to put together you know at least a Minimum Viable Product is what they call it an MVP so that you can see if the worst and you know what I'm sure you have friends that are really into coding it's really fun to work with your friends and maybe even other family to put together apps it's really it's a great goal to set together especially now so you know what I have total confidence you can figure it out in the next two months so many people are going to be staying and studying at home it's a great opportunity to develop new skills all right well thank you so much for that for these I'm going to actually suggest actually there's one question that just came in somebody said how do you use computer science to help your basketball team we use it all the time we call it analytics because we want to be able to monitor during the game as a player getting tired you know we monitor heart rates we monitor speed we monitor a lot of different variables that we put into algorithms that tell us okay this is the path they're on they're gonna be tired too quickly we track how they work out we track their performance how they shoot every piece of data we try to use to get a competitive advantage to help our Mavericks win a game and I'll tell you this if you want to work in sports learn to code learn statistics and learn artificial intelligence you may think because you're just a middle school or younger you may be too young you're not artificial intelligence is gonna be so impactful that by learning your programming languages any of them you'll be prepared to really be ahead of the curve when you get to high school college alright thank you so much mark before we wrap adapt design and Mark you're welcome to stick around to watch it'll take about 15 minutes but I don't think you have the time because yeah but no I appreciate it thanks Sophia you were great and congratulations to Paige all right well thank you and I'd like to right everybody to wave goodbye to market as we say for joining us and can you set the applause thanks guys right bye mark thank you so now we're gonna switch and introduce a lady named Hannah Walden Hannah what Hannah is one of the top computer science teachers in the entire country and she's one of the coauthors of the CS principles course that I was talking about earlier so Hannah's gonna be the one to actually rapid prototype Paige's idea and act so and also Hannah has had a little bit of a head start for the last five minutes of Q&A just because we're short on time so she hopefully got started building some of it but if we could unmute Hannah and introduce her hello everyone hi Paige Congrats on your winning idea I'm super excited to help you turn your mental wellness app into this prototype now Paige are there while we're getting Paige unmuted I'm gonna explain a little bit what's on your screen here so this is a pleb and we're gonna be working in a plaid Apple app has a couple different modes I have design mode and code mode and in design mode I can set up just how I want my screen to look by dragging on different elements so I can put a button on I can put an image in I could put a drop down on that the user could select like this oops let's go back to the screen that I'm on there we go and many different things that I can do and I can drag and drop these around I can change what's on these different buttons I could say hello and have the user click on this button so I can set all of this up in design mode and then in a little bit we're gonna hop into code mode and here is where I'm actually going to code the app all right Paige are you there hello hi Paige alright let's get started so as Hadi said while we were doing Q&A I got a bit of a head start so I have just the basics of the app laid out here but I want to get some ideas from you Paige so first what would you like for the title of your app okay you know one of the first things you should think of them I didn't maybe just okay this is something we could ask the people watching right you type in the chat with the title should be sure all right and howdy can you read from the chat for me giving tree tree giving tree Oh perfect okay so that's a great start and here's the basic layout of the home screen and again page this is all set so that we can change things around we can move things I've got an image here that starts as just a little seed and then as the user interacts it will grow into a tree I've got a place down here this is a user input input box where users can type in their positive comments but what I'm missing here is a button for users to click when they've added a comment I'm gonna drag a button over here like that and let's actually I'm gonna call this button my add button and instead of having the word button on it let's actually pick an icon instead so I'm gonna look and see what I have here all right page what do you like I've got plus with the square with the circle what looks good to you I like the the plus square what Square perfect okay we can also change the color of the icon do you have a preference there um maybe green okay perfect all right let's go with a green that shows up kind of a bright green all right perfect okay so now when the user put something in they're going to click on this plus button this add button and we will store their information and that will impact the tree that we see here I also put together one other screen this is the journal screen so I was thinking Paige was I'm on the homescreen and I add in different comments that I've made about myself and I want to save them now I can go to my journal by clicking the growth journal button and now I can see those things listed out here and I can go back to my home here before I do that I have the journal right here and it doesn't have a background color it's transparent so I was wondering Paige do you have a color that you'd prefer for our journal background um I like the light blue you chose all right let's see if I can get back to something Jimmy like this light blue right here right perfect okay so actually I can copy that hex code exactly go back over here go to my background color and now it matches perfectly okay all right so we've got the basic layout of our app we've got the title we've got the image we've got a place for the user to add their comment and to add in the comment and then we've got the journal so let's go code this app all right we're gonna work in block mode today and first we're going to pick the variables that we're going to store information in so I'm gonna drag a variable block out here and the first thing that I'm going to store is the comment the next thing that I want to store I know I'm gonna want to store how many comments the user has made so I'm gonna say comments count and right now how many comments do I have page zero zero so let's set that to zero I have no comments right now so I'm just gonna put an empty string up here it's completely blank now here's what's gonna happen when I click this button I'm gonna get the information from here it's gonna store in this variable up here the comment variable and then it's going to display the correct tree version and to do that I'm going to grab an on event block this yellow on event block drag it over and I'm going to choose the ID for this button which is the add button so when the add button is clicked I'm going to get the comment and I'm gonna update my variable so I'm gonna put the name of the variable here comment and now I'm gonna do some fancy stuff Here I am going to and I'm actually gonna close down my tool box you can see all this first I'm going to get whatever comments were previously stored at the beginning there's nothing it's just blank but as we add more and more comments we want to make sure that we don't forget those old comments I'm gonna get whatever comment was previously stored and I'm going to add in a blank line between each comment I do that by doing a backslash N and then I'm going to get the text from this area so I'm gonna say get text and if I click out of here now it will automatically turn those into blocks and now I can pick the ID for this area which is comment input there we go so that's now stored in comment and each time we get a new comment we need to increase our comment count I'm gonna do that here comments count equals comments count +1 all right now here's the fun part here's where we get to control our tree and I want to show you page I go here into manage assets you can see that I have a couple trees already uploaded here to show how the tree can grow over time so we're gonna throw in an if statement here I'm gonna choose this one and basically we're gonna say if comments count is over a certain number we're going to show a version of the tree so the first one I want to set is the one that will show the biggest tree so page what's the biggest number you think for the number of comments that should be for the final version of the tree normally I'd say probably like since it takes a couple months to form a habit but we don't have that time so maybe seven perfect and that is exactly what I would say yeah so normally this might be a couple thousand maybe or a couple hundred but since we're prototyping I don't want to type in a thousand comments to make sure this is working so we're just gonna put in seven and let's actually put in a couple more so I'm just gonna go straight down and say comments count is over six comments count is over five let's do comments count is over four and one more comments count is over three and now we're going to put in our picture images so if I go into the UI controls drawer and I'm going to choose set image URL now drag this over and again I'm going to close down my toolbox so you can see this better and the image here is called tree picture so I'm gonna select tree picture and again the most comments that should get the biggest tree and then the next one I'm gonna actually copy this with command C and then command V I can paste this down here to give me a little bit of a head start here so the next image we're gonna go with tree 5 and then tree 4 and then tree 3 entry to you and finally tree 1 which is just a seed and there we go okay the final thing that we need to do here is we need to make sure that all of these comments are going to get sent over to our journal so I'm going to pick the set text block which is right here and if I go over to my journal screen I can see that this is called Journal output so I'm gonna look for that here it is Journal output and I'm going to use that variable where I stored all of my comments and it will output it there so let's give this a try all right page I need a compliment I really like your glasses there we go and I hit the plus button oh no nothing happened when I clicked the plus button any ideas ooh now it is happening so do you know what happened there Paige why the tree didn't grow the first time I clicked the plus button mmhmm looking at your code uhhuh would it be that you didn't have an LS for one compliment you only had it for oh wait yeah that's exactly yeah that's exactly it so I had tree one set all the way until I have four comments in and once I get four comments in then it starts showing an image so let's let's actually bump that down a little bit so we can test this out quickly so I'm going to run this I'm going to say I read a book today and we hit plus and I could say I went to the kitchen and ate a really great sandwich and plus I notice it's starting to grow and then the more comments that I added in it would continue to grow and grow and grow and now if I click on the growth journal button it would take me to my journal but we haven't programmed that so let's do that really quick I'm gonna grab my own event again I'm gonna go here and stick it on the bottom and scroll down a little bit and now I'm gonna say when I click on my growth but my growth journal button if my screen does not lock up I'm not sure I think it's locking up a little bit on me and actually see if I can go to text and see if I can fix it that way that works okay so my growth journal button if we remember that's called journal button I'm gonna go back here and I'm gonna type Journal button and by the way what I did just there is one of the fun parts of Apple app at any point I can switch back and forth between blocks and text so when I go to when I click on the journal button I want to switch my screen so I'm going to actually go set screen to the journal screen and also I'm going to make sure that I have it set so that when I click on the home button it's on the journal screen page I'm gonna go to my home screen ok I think we're ready to try this out here we go we're gonna click run and hope for the best so my first compliment or my first comment might be I again I read a book today I I ate an apple I feel confident I can program an app I can be a computer scientist and my tree is growing every time I click on that let's go to my growth journal and now I can see that it is not displaying there maybe it is but the text is actually blue so we need to make sure that in our design we account for that so that our text if you look here text color is the same as our background color the text was there we just couldn't see it so one last quick test here we're just gonna say test test test test test test growth journal and there it is and our journal is populated and we back to our home screen now here's a really great thing actually I'm going to change one quick thing with our text if you notice it was our code every time I typed in here I had to delete my previous thing that I put in here before I could put something else I can make that a lot easier with code if I just put in a new set text down here and I'm going to say set the text for my comment input and I'm gonna set it to a blank string so what this means is when I put a new comment in it's going to reset it to be blank so I'm gonna say test and it's blank test and it's blank go to my growth screen again and our my growth journal it's ready alright this is really great page I really hope that you can take something like this and make it a full app again this is just a prototype but we were able to do this in 10 minutes which is incredible and for all of you at home here's the really fun part I am now going to share this app and I can click on send to phone now you have an option here to send to a u.s. phone number I am NOT going to be able to type in thousands of phone numbers right now that would take way too long so what I'm gonna do is show you how to use this QR code if you have a smart phone nearby you can pick up your smart phone and turn on the camera and hold it up to your screen so I'm gonna do this right here and once I hold it up to the screen I get a popup you might get something similar that says open in Safari so I'm going to open it and let it load for a minute and now I have Pages app on my phone and I hope you do too howdy do you have it on your phone okay show you I show the app on their phone so here's a phone that is so great I love it and page this was such a great idea it was really fun to build this with you I hope that you can in you to go with this idea and make it even better and for all of you who are watching we are going to share this app out and you can take it you can remix it you can make it your own you can make something similar please share it back with us using the hashtag code break we really can't wait to see what you make and again congratulations page back to you Hadi and everybody I hope you had a chance to scan that QR code I would say thank you everybody we're basically about to get done I wanted to talk about assignments and homework of challenges that you can do between now and next week we're gonna send you basically assignments or basically these challenges to either make an interactive card for beginners or to make an app or to do both if you want to try if you aren't signed up via email go to code org slash break and enter your email and then share out what you create using hashtag code break also because we're learning prototyping what you're gonna see when you get the email is some printouts that you can print first for an interactive card we want you to prototype the card first and write the behaviors before you jump into the code or if you're making an app design printout to actually make the flow of what screen goes to what so you have different screens that you can draw on throughout and draw out with your handwriting what you want to create like we said today's one for the day is a prototype and it's really important for any software engineer to take notes in advance and plan their code before they jump into it so parents the weekly challenge email is also going to include activities that students can do on a mobile phone and a really fun unplugged activity that teaches computer science without any screen time so if you haven't already signed up get on the mailing list by joining code org slash break lastly if you have any feedback on how we can improve please fill out our survey that's going to be emailed to you if you signed up and if you enjoyed this show please spread the word if each of you invites two other parents and each of them invites two other families and each of them invites two other families will soon have a hundred thousand families here and all of us can learn computer science together I want to switch to the gallery view and unmute as we say goodbye take a code break we'll see you next week
