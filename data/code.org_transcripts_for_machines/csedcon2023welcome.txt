hi everyone and welcome to code.org Global Computer Science Education conference I am so happy that we're all in this space together to share our knowledge to network and to discuss making Computer Science Education more accessible to students around the world my name is Le Olan Bowen and I the Strategic Partnerships manager for code.org I am also your host for this session if this is your first time here you're in for a treat ask anyone who has attended before and they'll tell you that CS just keeps getting better and better every year and this year is no different now before I get into the who's in the room and what you can expect from csad con I want to share a story about two very important students to me their experience with computer science and while your work in computer science education is so important so this is high school leolin after attending a private elementary school and one of the top high schools in the country she was accepted to the the University of Illinois in Urbana champagne now her mother being the very smart woman that she is suggested that she major in computers because they seem like they're going to become a big thing now teenage leolin replied in a way that only teenagers can with a hand on her hip and an eye roll that said Mom that is not for me that is only for white boys so fast forward to when I become a mom I still don't know too much about Computer Science Education but like my mom I can see how technology continues to shape our future in our culture but I decided to start my CS education campaign a little bit earlier with my son so as early as I could I got him into stem programs because I did what I didn't want was for him to grow up and miss out on an amazing field because he like Teenage lolan didn't see himself in it you see Teenage lolan wasn't inverse to computer science because she thought she wasn't good at math or wasn't good at science or even that she didn't see how important technology was it was solely based on whatever messages she received up until that time that told her this ain't for you although I put my son into steam at 5 it was a people in this room that really helped me focus on my son's education for example he already had some familiarity with co.org in fact when I applied for my job at code.org about 5 years ago and I was like son I'm you know applying for this job at this organization called code.org he says Oh you mean the hour of code my kiddo who is now in eighth grade is taking algebra one because of what I learned from Carol Fletcher who's in this room um and the team at E3 Alliance um from the University of Texas Austin in a study they conducted titled Algebra 1 before high school is a gatekeeper to computer science participation and they found that Black and hispan Hispanic students my son happens to be both regardless of family income enrolled in Algebra 1 in 8th grade at rates substantially lower to their white and Asian counterparts in Texas now this is a major issue because their results show that students who took Algebra 1 before high school had double the odds of being enrolled in a computer science course so this is only one story about someone in this room who has had a positive farreaching effect in computer science education so I encourage you to connect to share your stories with other folks in this room because you have no idea a how far your fet could have as well so who else is in this room where it happens the crcs atcon well we have over 400 participants um this year they come from there are 60 leaders from 17 countries we have 42 States represented including DC we have 25 people from this wonderful state of Nevada alone and then we have over 230 CEOs directors VPS principes superintendents SCA and Lea staff researchers nonprofits and Industry reps in this room this year so what will you learn at csdc con this year of course we're going to talk about recruiting Ur GS to CS we're going to be talking about how AI is affecting the future of Education work and computer science and we're going to be talking about how states are implementing the computer science Grant requirements and of course more engaging topics but we are especially excited to announce the release of the seventh state of Computer Science Education report coauthored by code.org csca and esep I see some of you all already have it in your hands right now so it's great a little taste of what's included this year is that 57.5% of high schools offer computer science in the US so make sure you if you haven't already pick up your copy at the registration table and then on Friday we'll go through a report together in more detail in the meantime I have a couple of slides of QR codes if you want to get your phone out um we have a pdf version of the report online at advocacy. co.org or you can scan the QR code right here on our site we have handouts for all 50 states and DC with additional information to access information about computer science in your state we also love for you to help us promote this report if you follow this QR code it'll take you to code.org social media post about the state ex CS so please spread the word by liking and sharing the post as well we much appreciate it now I mentioned before that what makes CS edcon special is that it's a global Computer Science Education conference in this room are people

well as I would like to uh express my gratitude and welcome you all by saying in Bangla I mean in my mother tongue shano honorable ministers and delegates from all around the world uh and again special thanks to all I'm Professor Nal Ahmed the director General at the directorate of secondary and higher education from the Ministry of Education of Bangladesh representing our honorable education Minister unfortunately due to prior commitments she is unable to join us here today we are proud to announce the revised National curriculum emphasizing ICT and computer science in education it marks a significant step towards transforming our education system to create smart citizen as we are building a smart Bangladesh by 2041 through these reforms we aim to empower our Learners with the knowledge and skills needed for success in today's and future world currently coding and ICT is being taught from grade three and the separate subject on digital technology has been introduced starting from grade six making it mandatory for all students till grade 12 I'm eagerly looking forward to discovering how other nations are extending computer Science Education to rural regions and managing the intell integration of AI tools to enhance the learning experiences I would like to give my gratitude to code.org for the opportunity to collaborate exchange ideas and insights with participating Nations on these critical topics thank you again again and welcoming you all especially to CSC I mean conference uh science CSC uh uh CS education conference 2023 and related to all again I extend my heartiest felicitations to you all thank you another big round of applause for international colleagues thank you so much I am so excited to be here with you this afternoon my name is Joan Ebert and I am honored to serve as the state superintendent of Public Instruction in the great state of Nevada we had our birthday yesterday as a state October 31st is um when Abraham Lincoln proclaimed Nevada as the 36th state in the Union we are Battle Born globally prepared for all of our students here in Nevada I am really proud of the work that has transpired over the last 10 years and during the Gale I was actually speaking with Pat a few weeks ago about how he on the team and hottie came actually to uh the Clark County School District which is here and you know they were like oh you guys need to join and do all of all of this work and we're like hey that does sound exciting so 10 years ago we signed on WE participated in the hour of code had to look at the leaderboard to make sure that we were leading the way and that the kids were participating and so to be here on stage today to share with you that now 10 years later Nevada our great state has adopted all of the policies that are named Within code.org High School graduation being one of those policies we're very excited about we also have standards starting in kindergarten all the way through 12th grade it's integrated into all of our grades with that too we just released very excited equity and diversity all of the work that goes along equity and diversity we heard our speakers talk about women
