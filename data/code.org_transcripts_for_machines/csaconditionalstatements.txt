one of the most exciting things as a teenager is getting a driver's license but a person has to be a certain age to qualify for one to check if someone is allowed to get a driver's license we can use something called a conditional statement a conditional statement is a statement that only executes when a condition is true to tell the difference between true and false we use something called a boolean a boolean is a primitive data type that can be either true or false one way to write a conditional statement is by starting with the keyword if an if statement has two main components first we need to specify the condition we want to check inside the parentheses we can write any statement that will result in a boolean value either true or false in this case we want to check whether or not someone is 16 or older secondly we want to specify what should happen if the condition is true inside the curly braces we write the code we want to execute if the condition is true in this case anyone over 16 will obtain a license the code and the body of the if statement will execute only if the condition is true if the condition returns false then no license is given we can now write code that makes decisions this is the beginning of designing flexible programs that can solve more complex problems and work in multiple situations you
