the hour of code is an hourlong introduction to computer science for all students no previous experience is required and the activities are designed to be selfguided empowering students to learn at their own pace this matters because the number of computing jobs in this country is rising three times faster than the number of computer science graduates we expect to have more than a dozen different 1our tutorials to choose from each introducing computer science in its own way for all students from K through 12 for example we are expecting one tutorial to teach how to create an interactive card using the programming environment scratch our own tutorial will introduce some computer science principles through a series of puzzles that are fun to solve you can offer the hour of code on a range of devices including tablets PCS Macs and smartphones there will even be unplugged tutorials that can be completed without any computers at all the first thing you will need to figure out is where you will do your hour of code one option is to use a computer lab with internet connected PCS or Macs another option is to do the hour of code in your classroom using tablets or smartphones as long as they can access the internet students can also take turns doing the hour of code in your classroom using a shared Internet connected computer in fact we encourage students to do the hour of code together in pairs or small groups research shows that students retain more when they're programmed together the unplugged options can be done anywhere even Outdoors these activities are especially fun for group and really illustrate the point computational thinking does not require a computer we encourage you to try doing the selected tutorial yourself before your class does it so you can answer any questions that might come up finally it will be time for your students to do the hour of code themselves have them visit our website and choose the tutorial that you selected if you're doing an unplugged tutorial pass out the materials and explain the rules your students will enjoy doing the hour of code the tutorials are designed to be fun students who finish early can try a different perhaps more advanced tutorial or help other students and that's it as you've seen offering the hour of code to your students is easy it requires minimal prior preparation and no prior experience in just 1 hour you will have given your students an engaging and meaningful exposure to the world of computer science and help demystify what can be an intimidating subject to some
