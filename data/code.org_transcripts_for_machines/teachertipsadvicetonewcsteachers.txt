just leverage code.org and all the materials that they give you they give you a ton of stuff they give you powerpoint decks they give you a full curriculum the lesson plans include information about what to say even between the different transitions in the lesson and they're all structured in such a great way with the warmup and activity and a wrapup follow the curriculum the way it's written go through it your first year as it's written in the curriculum and then after you've now experienced units 1 through 10 then you can make adjustments here and there to follow the curriculum i know it seems cumbersome i know it seems like a lot and there's a lot of stuff you might not be familiar with terms uh but the activities are really strong and typically if you teach at multiple periods the first period will be a little clunky but even the second or third time you teach the lesson um it goes really smoothly and you get a lot more comfortable thoroughly read through the lesson plans there are so many links in the lesson plans that link to such great ideas that it's worth your time to really spend reading them uh some of the things that are linked in the lesson plans are modifications for students with special needs there are extension ideas for students who are high achieving there are virtual ideas for classrooms that are virtual there are hybrid ideas for classrooms that are hybrid there are unplugged activities for classrooms that are in person i would say it's really important if you're not comfortable with the content to fake it till you make it at the beginning of the day skim through the lesson don't feel like you need to understand every piece don't stay up late at night obsessing over it doing all this research
