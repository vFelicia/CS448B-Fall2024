let's talk about what we mean when we say computer science computer science is a field where people use the power of computers to solve big problems so is there a difference between computer science and coding the answer is yes coding is the set of instructions you give to a computer but computer science is a more holistic view of a field which includes coding but also includes things like what to do with a really big set of data how the internet works and its societal impacts and how to prepare and break down problems for solutions that use coding also as a note code.org is all about the promotion of the computer science field not just coding we're called code.org because it's short and snappy computer science.org does not have the same ring so coding or programming is instructions that you give to a computer and there are two primary categories of programming languages textbased programming languages and visual programming languages languages like javascript or python are text based but we'll be learning to program with blockly which uses visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs it's easier to learn programming using a visual language versus a text based language because when you're learning to program you're up against two things learning the logic of how to write programs and also the syntax of writing programs so in both visual and textbased programming you're learning the logic of writing programs like how to repeat instructions or how to make the computer decide between two instructions syntax is a set of rules on how to combine instructions so the computer can understand them so in visual programming languages syntax is easy because you have a menu of available instructions which you can drag and place next to other instructions and then you're good to go in textbased programming syntax is more difficult because you have to remember what the instructions are called and you have to be very precise in what you type like where you put a semicolon or remembering to include an exclamation point by starting to learn to program with a visual programming language you can focus on the logic without worrying about if you're remembered to put a closed parenthesis or not then once you've got the logic of programming down you can choose to move on to a textbased programming language if you want which can be more powerful and efficient than visual languages if you're experienced with textbased programming so this learning progression is kind of like learning to crawl and get really getting really good at that before you learn to walk but by no means is learning to program with a visual language a copout it's even how a lot of big universities like harvard and berkeley teach coding in their intro to computer science classes and just like learning math in elementary school you start with addition and subtraction our courses are the addition and subtraction equivalent for computer science if your students continue to study computer science they'll be on their way to writing apps curing diseases by working with big sets of medical data or writing programs for the rovers on mars computer science affects so many different fields these days it's not limited to writing software it's a way to change the world computer science is creative and empowering and when you learn the foundational skills in elementary school this exposes it to students who might not opt into studying it otherwise not all of your students are going to grow up and become computer scientists but computer science is all about problem solving critical thinking and persistence skills that will definitely be needed no matter what career your students pursue and programming is also about explaining instructions so clearly that something without a brain can understand you and we can all benefit from having better explanation skills
