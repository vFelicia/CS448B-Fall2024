Now we know how to create rule sets in CSS, but where do we put them? And how will our web page know how to apply these rules? All of our CSS rules will live in a file separate from the HTML. We'll refer to this file is the style sheet for the web page. The file name usually ends in dot CSS. Now our style sheet exists, but the web page doesn't know about it yet. We need to add a link element in HTML file telling it about the style sheet. When the browser goes to load the contents of the web page, it will see that link element for the style sheet and use those style rules to figure out how page should be displayed. To add a link to the stylesheet, we add the link tag. Inside the tag, we specify that the link is to a style sheet and and the name of the CSS file.
