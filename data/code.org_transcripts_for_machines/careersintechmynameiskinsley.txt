my name is kinsley i work at facebook as a software engineer the goal of facebook is to make the world a more open and connected place i work on the safe relator team which lets you save uh cool things you find on the internet like videos posts things like that so you can come back to them later i like working at facebook because i have to work with like a lot of smart people i get to work on something that like over a billion people use on the planet i just enjoy work my coworkers having device team members is also important because especially like facebook where you're trying to make a product for um the whole world you can't have like just a single set of people you want you want to represent the people you're trying to serve you may use facebook one way but someone could be using it completely differently or people are in different situations so like not everyone has like the newest smartphone you might have to remember that there's people in like other countries and lower end devices you have to make sure it works for them i like that it sort of scratches that like problemsolving part of my brain so i get to come in and just sort of think about how to do something then get to see if my idea works or not um computer's really good at telling you really quickly if uh something's gonna work or not probably my first job i remember wanting to have was i want to be an astronaut i went to this summer program when i was like in third or fourth grade and someone there taught me how to use this um old programming language called hypercard and with that i made like a really basic game where you built like a little ship and like flew across the solar system after that i like sort of just played around with computers a little bit i was lucky my high school had a programming class so i'd like to learn more about programming there a career in tech is attainable by anyone all you really need to get started is just a computer you don't have to start large you can make something super small i made like a game that only iu ever played or when i was in high school i made a like a program only i use that would like help me solve my math problems computer science is definitely a creative medium there's not like one way to solve a problem so it's up to you to sort of come up with the given your constraints that come up with the creative solution but probably the best way to get started is just uh you can try like emulating something you like like an app you like or a game or something make something just for yourself there's nothing really stopping you you
