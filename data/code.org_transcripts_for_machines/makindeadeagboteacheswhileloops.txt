While loops are pretty similar to what you do in everyday life. Imagine you are washing your car and you will keep scrubbing until it's clean. So while it's not clean, you continue to scrub. So you are evaluating the stains all the time. Hey there ! You got a new loop to help your farmer out. It's called a “while” loop. It's pretty simple actually. While the statement at the top is true, do something. For example, while there is a pile, remove one shovel full. Go ahead and give it a try with your farmer.
