my first computer was a generic xt computer and i remember the big decision when i bought that computer is whether or not i would buy a computer with a hard drive it was only 20 megabytes in those days that was huge the hour code is a global initiative intended to encourage students of all age groups to look at computer coding computers programming and to try to demystify exactly what programming is the hour of code is a worldwide event trying to engage as many students as they can to participate in programming code it's important to give opportunities to the students to open up their eyes to something very different very new but yet at the same time make them excited about it it's for all levels i mean there's students in kindergarten that do this and then there's students in high school that do this they don't often have the chance to have the freedom to get in there and kind of play around with computers in the way that they want to in a way that's engaging when they get frustrated they call me over and they say i don't know how to do this and i say i don't know either let's do it together and it's a great great piece for kind of those connections that we build together what is the hour of code it's a chance to see that there was something behind that screen now there's a language that exists and that they get the opportunity to work with that language when i see the the kids sitting in front of the screen it's important for them because they're learning how to problem solve they're learning how to troubleshoot they're learning to persevere in this day and age of instant gratification i think that it's a good skill to have they're basically not even aware of all of the math and science skills that they're using and they're having fun doing it the ability for them to take that problem solving the critical thinking and then apply it to not just school subjects but like everyday life those pieces are crucial this is a great way for them to build confidence they're able to take it much further than just the computer they came in first thing this morning and said miss fader we did 60 lines of code last night and that shows me that they are taking the initiative on their own it's a new way of learning you
