In this example, your goal is to get zombie to the sunflower. We could use five move forward blocks or we could tell the computer to move forward and repeat five times using the one repeat block. This saves time and makes it way easier. To use it, just put the move forward block inside the repeat block. Hit run and the zombie will move forward five times to the yummy sunflower.
