Hi, my name is Alice and I run the product and engineering teams here at Code.org and I worked on this tutorial that you're playing through right now. You just made it to the last level. Congratulations! You just learned everything you need to know to make your own Star Wars game. Now there are no more instructions, no puzzles to solve. You can make your own game and you choose how it works. One more thing, you've unlocked new sounds and new commands to do even more. [students speaking] So we made a game basically where you get points when you get puffer pigs. The twist is everytime you get a puffer pig a storm trooper appears. Eventually the whole screen is full of puffer pigs and then when you touch 10,000 of them, you win. [students speaking] We made a game where you can't lose and everything you kill gives you points. For my program, I reversed the keys so that whenever you click up, your character goes down and when you click right, your character goes left. It's really hard! Sometimes you just get an advantage, an inherent advantage if you're the developer of the game. Did I get it? Yay! When you're done making your game, choose share to get a link you can share with friends or play your game on your phone. Have fun!
