The Hour of Code is kicking off Computer Science Education Week and I'm really, really pleased to be about to sit down with you guys and start coding. This campaign called the Hour of Code started exactly 3 years ago. Three years later every single country in the world has done an Hour of Code. We've passed 300 million Hours of Code And 20 billion lines of code written by students just like yourselves. This is going to be something that is as important as learning to read or learning to do math in the coming years. It helps us understand more of, like, how some people work and it's really cool and a fun experience. And what are you working on? Every job we're going to do in the future will rely on technology and be benefitted if you are powerful users of the technology that surrounds us. If I hit him he explodes. Very nice. This Hour of Code website... code.org. I'm going to get my kids to go on that. Oh actually we forgot something very important. Oh yeah, we gotta put in the ball. As we talk about all the different challenges we're facing right now, right here we're talking about one of the solutions we have. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
