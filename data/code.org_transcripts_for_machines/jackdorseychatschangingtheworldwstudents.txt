all right hello all right hello everyone and thank you for joining us today to kick off the IR code uh with the cofounder of Twitter himself Jack dorsy I'm gonna go ahead and let Jack say a few words and then we'll go straight to your questions well thank uh thank you all for having me um I'm excited about the conversation it's uh it's always exciting to talk about one of my one of my passions which is uh programming and just what you're able to create um out of nothing in a in a very very simple way so looking forward to it thank you Jack okay so um our first class room is John M Elementary and we're gonna let them go ahead and ask their question John Mir John Mir um what was your inspiration for creating Twitter uh the inspiration was really around um trying to figure out how the world worked uh Twitter was a way to uh share what people were doing and where they were and where they were going and you could do it from your phone and you could be anywhere in the world and you could share that so I could actually see how the world was living and breathing and and uh and just generally working through it and I got into it because I got into uh dispatch programming so an ambulance or a fir truck or a uh police car if you listen to them on the radio they're always reporting where they are what they're doing and where they're going next so I have a patient I'm going to St John's Mercy hospital and I'm at Fifth in Broadway and that's a very very similar idea to what Twitter is today where you just talk about what you're doing what's happening around you and you're sharing and if you consume it if you read it you can see the world thank you all right thank you Jack our next question is from Pearl ask you Elementary um how did hashtags evolve to be such a big part of the Twitter experience well one one of the uh it's a great question one of the best um parts of Twitter is that the people that use it actually invent new ways of of using it all the time so uh there was a guy named chrisina who started categorizing his tweets by putting a little number sign and then a word a key word behind it and he started using this and more people looked at him and saw that that was an interesting behavior and we should do it too and eventually it just took off and became a whole movement and little by little we saw it outside of Twitter we saw it um in the world we saw it on billboards and we saw it on television and now it's become this cultural uh movement where uh people are using it for everything they're using it even in text messages not just not just tweets so anytime you see that half symbol though or or the at sign uh a lot of people think of Twitter and it's become a great way to um reference a topic or reference an events in the world but it was all organically it was all by it was all by the people using the service and it was purely invented by by them thank you Jack um our next question is from Woodmont School um can they go looking back what would you change about um what would you change about how you approached your education or career path how I approach my education or career path or career path um would you change anything about how you approached it well I I think uh I think generally you always do things for the for the right reasons and it doesn't always make sense at the time but it does make sense when you look back but um I would um if there's anything I would change um I would I would definitely uh start sooner um I think uh we we often put off things because we figure well you know it's a long life and we have plenty of time to do that in the future and we can wait until next year to do that or we can wait until I'm out of I'm out of this particular grade or or what not but if you start today uh you'll be so much farther ahead than anything and you can learn so much faster right now because you have such a greater um energy and also a greater context for what you want to build and what you want to see in the world so I would definitely not wait I would uh take my ideas I would get them out in code I would draw them I would paint them I would talk about them I would share them and I would start working on them um as quickly as possible because you always you always learn faster when you do that great thank you all right our next question is from Oakwood Intermediate did anyone especially a teacher Inspire or help you when you were thinking about making Twitter um a lot of my uh yeah it's you you definitely need the people in your life that um not just inspire you but ask great questions and questions that make your work better so a lot of my coworkers a lot of my friends when I would show them my idea uh would ask questions that would make it better sometimes they would say you know why why are you thinking that like that doesn't make sense at all um and that would make me reflect and then change uh how I thought about the service what what I was doing um so the sooner this goes back to the previous question but the sooner you can get it outside of your own head stop thinking about it get it out on paper get it out on code to actually share with the people that inspire you but also who ask who will ask clarifying questions and start using it and tell you how it feels if it's something that they want to keep doing or or not um that's the fastest way to uh succeeding so um definitely keep those people close to you in your life great thank you um our next question is going to be from Whittier Christian Schools hello Jack dors my name is Joseph Garcia and hi Christian schools and I would like to ask you what are your future goals uh my my my goals are are really um my my goals are really um making sure that um I can use what what I want to what I want to see in the world so a lot of a lot of Twitter and a lot of square came to be simply because we wanted to use them simply because we wanted to see them and then we learned whatever we had to to make it work so we learned how to program we learned how to build a business we learned how to hire people uh we learned how to take feedback and correct things and keep a system up these are not things that we originally started knowing it's something that we had to do to make it work so um there's a lot more that I want to see and a lot more that I want to use in the world and right now my focus is on communication with Twitter and and commerce with square I think we can improve a lot and I think the more we make it easier for people to transact or to sell with square or to communicate with Twitter we actually give time back to people to focus on what's most meaningful to them whether it be programming whether it be hanging out with their friends whether it be having a conversation all these things are more meaningful than having to deal with technology so we want technology to to get out of the way completely and and that would be my goal is to make technology um disappear even more all right thank you um our next question is going to be from St Luke's School uh please describe how you got started programming um I started programming because um my parents had a uh a PC Junior um this was back in uh 1987 and they had a computer that I could access and I could use and the reason I started programming is because I loved Maps I loved uh uh maps of cities specifically specifically so I taught myself how to program U by learning from other people's source code uh there was an operating system called Linux and I learned how to program from Linux I learned how to program from other open source tools mainly just looking at other people's code allowed me to teach myself how to uh how to program and then I also asked my friends uh who knew more about computers than I did uh to sit with me and and check my work but it came out of desire to draw maps on my computer screen because then I could make them move and I could play with them more um so again it wasn't something that uh I really necessarily wanted to do or knew how to do it's something I had to do because it's something that allowed me to to play with something to use something that I really wanted to use and really wanted to play with and programming allowed me to do that in a very very fast uh in an easy manner as soon as I learned some of the syntax which is kind of like learning a a foreign Lang a foreign language a bit um but I think it's a little bit easier because you have such a great amount of um folks to to talk to about it but you can also see it working which is really important great thank you Jack um our next question is going to be from Rock Island Elementary School um what is your favorite computer game favorite favorite computer game I wasn't uh I wasn't into games uh computer games a lot when I was a when I was a kid what I loved playing was um Sim City uh there was a it's a city simulator and I think the equivalent today the thing most like it today is probably Minecraft so you build um you build uh exactly what you want to see and and you spend all this time uh really building a city and a universe around you so it's not much a it's not as much a game as it is a toy and the difference is a game you know you you want to win but a toy you actually keep playing with and you learn from right it teaches you more and more things and I think uh I've played with uh Minecraft a bit and um I think it's one of those one of those toys that actually teaches you how to think about building an organization how to think about building a city um how to manage resources and use those resources to build new things so I'm a I'm a big fan of uh of things like Minecraft but for me when I was a kid it was uh it was called Sim City and and that's what I spent most of my um most my gaming time on I think you have a lot of Minecraft fans in the crowd there was there was some excitement when you said it yeah um all right we're gonna have one more question um this is from a school that uh the snow uh caused them they couldn't go to school today but the teacher has gathered some of her students who live nearby uh to participate so let's have them ask their question did you ever think when you created Twitter it would be used by second graders at school um that's a great question when when we created it we weren't really thinking about who would use it we were thinking about how we would use it and I think that's the most important thing to do when you're starting anything is how are you going to use it because if if you're building it for yourself then you'll have passion to keep building it and to do all the hard things that you need to do to get it out into the world and to to see it through so um little by little we see we saw all these great people who came to the service and started using it in super creative ways uh including second graders at school um but it it's really a it's really a thing that um provides such a great utility that anyone can come to it and they can use it in whatever way they wish and they all have different they all take away different value from it and and that's really important to us but we had no idea how big it would be or or um how Global it would be or how fast it would spread and I think if you get too way down in thinking about that instead of just focused on what you're building today and presently it's going to be really hard to uh to start and really hard to build and really hard to succeed ultimately in the end so um start now and and and focus on what you want to see in the world and what you want to use and uh it may resonate with other people in a way that surprises you thank you Jack um um everybody appreciates you taking the time today to answer our questions um and we had viewers from across the country watching in as well um so uh everybody why don't you give a big round of applause to Mr we appreciate you coming in today
