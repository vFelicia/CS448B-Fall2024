hi my name is mural cadby and I'm a dancer software developer and creator of illuminate computer science relates to creativity in numerous ways immeasurable really I mean once you have the ability to write software you can put ideas into anything I do it with light suits there's so much you can do once you have the tools to write software and it's the possibilities are really endless over the next hour you're going to get started with computer science and artificial intelligence by coding your own dance party we've assembled some hip music and a team of great dancers for you to play with you'll be using blocks of code to choose different dancers change your dance moves make them respond to the music and make them interactive as you code your dance party you'll get to work with artificial intelligence to generate cool backgrounds the instructions for each level will be up here at the top of the screen when you start coding you will drag blocks from the toolbox into the workspace after you press run you will see your dance party in action in the play Space if you want a hint click on the light bulb if your code has a bug feedback will show up here under the instructions to help you out try it yourself and if you're feeling stuck it's okay just get up and get moving and before you know it you'll have made your own dance party so what will you create
