hello I'm Olga I grew up in Russia and then I went to the University of Maryland College Park and got a degree in computer science from there in 2009 after that I went and join Amazon as a software developer a position I was really excited about because I love reading and I love books I love reading historical fiction and also a lot of nonfiction biographies of interesting people such as Steve Jobs or Tina Fe a variable is a container that you can store a value in when you use that variable in an algorithm it opens up the container and looks at the value inside this lets you write smarter algorithms that behave differently depending on the value stored in the variable for example if you wanted to write an algorithm to say happy birthday you're turning 10 to my little brother that's great now but when I run it next year I'd want it to say happy birthday you're turning 11 I could create a variable called age to store my brother's age and write my algorithm that say Happy Birthday you're turning age instead because variables can change each year I can update the variable age to equal age + 1 in this puzzle we're going to be using a variable that will set the length of the line our artist draws later on in our code the move for board block will look at that length variable to see what value you've set it to
