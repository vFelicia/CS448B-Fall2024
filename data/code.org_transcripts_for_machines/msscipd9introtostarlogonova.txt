hi and welcome please join me in a guided tour of a new agent based modeling environment called Star logo Nova Star logo Nova was produced by the sheller teacher education program or step at MIT we are excited that you will be learning to use Star logo Nova to teach about topics in earth life and physical sciences in starlogo Nova environment you will be able to create share collaborate and store your very own computer models on the web so are you ready let's start having some fun with Star logo Nova first you need to open your internet browser and navigate to W w SL Nova org I will walk you through the steps on how to set up an account it's easy and you'll be up and running in no time so to create an account click on the register for an account link choose a username and password and you're going to want to enter an email address so that we can send you your password if you forget it once you have created your account click on the my profile link then click the Create a new project button to create a new project we will be starting from a blank project so choose that and then click Submit this is the starlogo Nova in the programming environment at the top of the page is some information about the project such as title description and author which is you pretty cool change the title and description to be something useful below the project information is the 3d world where the model will run we call this area space land the buttons in this area are used to control the model you can move the view by dragging and scrolling your mouse why don't you go ahead and try it below space land is the programming workspace or blocks where you will program the behaviors of your agents so basically here is what you're going to program put your blocks and tell them what to do here on the left are the drawers where you will find our commands for creating our program notice the drawers are full of command blocks you create your program by dragging blocks from these drawers and connecting them together on the pages of the agents on the right there are three different pages one for the world one for the agents other than the world and one for the breeds pages are areas where you organize blocks to program the different agents the user interface buttons in the space land that controlled the simulation are linked to the command blocks in these pages so for example if I put a when set up push block on the world page whenever the user pushes the setup block in Spaceland the commands I placed within that block or run or executed so basically whatever I told in my program my agents to do when I click setup they then follow those directions and run through the program now that you have taken a tour of the user interface you can get started on the tutorial
