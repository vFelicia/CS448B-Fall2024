This is the Harvester. She runs a big farm and needs your help to pick the crops that are ready to be harvested. Use the "move" and "turn" blocks to get the harvester from crop to crop. Then use the pick blocks to collect all of the corn, lettuce and pumpkins. The bottom right corner will show you how many are available at that spot. If you see more than one you'll need to pick the crops multiple times in the same square. Keep an eye out for sprouts! You won't know what crop those are or how many there are until the program is run. So your code may need to check what kind of crop is there before picking it. The sun is shining and it's time to harvest! "Lettuce" get started.
