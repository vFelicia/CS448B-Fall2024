I started learning computer programming when I was 10 years old because my dad brought a computer home uh it was a Commodore 64 and he gave it to me and my twin brother and he told us you know this doesn't have any games on it so you need to learn to write your own games figure out how to program the computer yourselves I would not have tried learning computer programming or computer science if it hadn't been for the computer that my dad gave me because my school didn't teach it and thanks to what I learned on my own it opened up a world of opportunity for me and this is an opportunity that isn't something that just a few people should be able to have but today 30 years later 90% of our schools still don't teach basic computer science which means 90% of kids don't have the access to participate in a world that is being turned upside down by technology our schools teach kids how to dissect a frog and how the weather works but today it's equally fundamental to learn how to dissect an app or how the internet works last year code.org organized a Grassroots campaign cign to teach kids just 1 hour of code and since then we've taught 40 million students in 200 countries but learning goes Way Beyond the first hour we've now put full courses into 30,000 classrooms and we've trained almost a th000 new computer science teachers our goal this year is to train 10,000 computer science teachers and to get 100 million students to try one hour of code across all grades worldwide with your help it's going to cost $5 million to do this now we've built Fant fantastic courses that students and teachers love but we need support to bring these courses to classrooms and to train teachers to integrate them into the curriculum to provide imperson training for teachers and to get computer science added to the course schedule oh my gosh who it has to move three steps has to turn right and then it has to go straight again oh my gosh it's working I did it they don't even have to be a computer science engineer maybe they want to do something else but in our world this is going to be the basis for everything that we do there is nothing more important than our young people's futures hour of code and code.org are giving our youth the ability to prosper in the Modern Age generous donors such as Microsoft Google salesforce.com Bill Gates and Reed Hoffman have committed to match your donations so for each dollar you give two students will learn one boy and one girl everybody knows the technology is moving fast it shouldn't be passing Us by and the idea that 90% of our schools aren't even preparing our kids for the future just isn't right we can fix this and we are fixing it but a sea change in education takes a critical mass of people who care please join this movement contribute today and share this video with a friend please help give every student the opportunity to pursue some of the best jobs in the world and to succeed in any future career thank you so much for your help
