sometimes we need to print information to the console this information could tell the user something like saying hello printing information about objects can also help us find errors and debug them in java we print to the console using system.out.print whatever is inside the parentheses is printed to the console for example if we wanted to print hello we can write hello and side quotation marks as the argument when we run our code we see hello displayed in the console we can also print the information that is returned from a method let's say we have a class called dog that has a method called get treat this method returns whether or not a dog object has a treat if we want to print whether or not a dog object called fido has a treat we call fido.gettreat insidethesystem.out.print when we run our code we see whether or not fido has a treat displayed in the console the value true by itself doesn't tell us much about what this means or represents we need to label this value using something called concatenation concatenation is joining two strings together we concatenate using the plus sign so if we want to first write the words fido has a treat and then display the status we can use the plus sign to concatenate these together now when we run our code we see the text final has treat and then the value let's make two objects one for fido and one for a new dog called max if we have multiple dog objects we can print the information for each one to the console but this displays everything as one line of text this is because system.out.print leaves the cursor at the end of the line that it printed we can use the system.out.println to print a line of text and then move the cursor to the next line now we see the information for each dog object printed on separate lines printing to the console is useful for debugging code and giving information to the user we can track the state of our objects as they execute tasks to easily identify possible errors you
