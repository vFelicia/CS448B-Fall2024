debugging is finding and fixing problems there are lots of ways to debug problems one of the easiest is to move step by step until you find where something goes wrong here i'm trying to do a back handspring on the beam but i keep falling off i walked through each part step by step and realized where my mistake was i wasn't putting my hands on the beam correctly so i tried another back handspring on the beam with my new hand position and i got it i was really glad i debugged my back handspring to learn about debugging we start out with a set of blocks already on the stage you'll notice that these blocks won't get you to the goal so we need to debug this solution and fix it what went wrong you'll notice that you needed to keep going west one more block so let's fix this by adding another west block and hitting run to see if you got it right yay you got it
