Lesson 6 teaches algorithms and gets across how important it is to be as clear as possible. This lesson has two parts. The first uses tangrams which are puzzle pieces taht look like this. If you don't have tangrams, you or your students can cut them out by hand. Students will have to explain to a fellow classmate how to arrange tangrams in a specific pattern but the second student isn't able to see what the original pattern is. In the second half of the activity, we ask students how many different ways they can fold a piece of paper to create sixteen identical rectangles. Then you'll discuss how multiple solutions can lead to the same end result and why some solutions are better in certain situations.
