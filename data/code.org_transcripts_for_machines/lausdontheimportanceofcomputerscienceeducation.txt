I was exposed to coding courses as early as sixth grade so I feel like I use computational thinking every single day it's about being analytical and being able to problem solve too many times students feel like that is for somebody else and not for me we need to change that and we need to uh have students understand that we're not just competing within your own classroom in your own School in your own City you're competing against students all over the world as early as the elementary school it gets students to think about what does it really mean to give commands to a computer to actually do something customized to what they need or want to do uh so we've been strategizing about how to best to do that and finding Partners such as code.org so the computer industry is more than computer programming I mean there are probably thousands of different types of jobs we need some more females in this industry even if they don't end up actually working in computer in the computer science field the skills the way of thinking the problem solving pieces that they learn in those classes they'll be able to use in mathematics and science I actually became a better writer as a result of taking these types of courses because of the ability to be able to translate what's in your mind at a very detailed level for us it's important to be able to provide multiple opportunities for students let's try this out give the opportunity to students and you know what once students are in there and practicing realizing that yeah this is actually something I can do and this could be for me let's let's keep moving
