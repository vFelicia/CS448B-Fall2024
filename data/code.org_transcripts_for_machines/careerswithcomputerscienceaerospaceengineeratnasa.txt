foreign Davis and I'm an aerospace engineer at NASA what's NASA and liftoff NASA is a space agency that is looking to help the world better understand what's going on around us and other planets what do you do at NASA I use computers every day I program spacecrafts to look at specific points on a planet to get back science data what do the spacecrafts do various missions that we have they have different objectives whether it's increasing the knowledge on the weather to things like increasing knowledge about asteroids when did you learn about computer science I knew about computers growing up we had you know computer class but I wasn't that into computers and maybe it was because I thought that wasn't like the cool thing to do but it wasn't until later that I started to understand what possibilities come with computers and then I started saying this is actually kind of fun after I took a class in programming now it's something that I do almost on a daily basis something that I thought I couldn't do I'm doing every day and it's a lot of fun what is the coolest thing about your job the single coolest thing to me about working at Nasa is the fact that I can look into the sky at night and think about all the spacecrafts that I've worked on that are currently orbiting the Earth or orbiting an asteroid is really rewarding and so that's really cool to me
