here we're going to use the repeat block to help us save some steps when programming our artist we already have some blocks out on our stage but they only get us started to loop those same blocks four times to draw the whole square we just drag out the repeat block and put the move forward and turn right blocks inside the repeat block when we hit run the artist will repeat those steps four times and complete the square
