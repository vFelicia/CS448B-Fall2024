so hi everybody welcome to code break my name is hadi and there's a whole bunch of people joining us on a zoom call as well as on facebook live and on youtube live together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom with so many students at home due to the pandemic my team at code.org invites families everywhere to join us for a weekly dose of inspiration community and computer science i'm here with my daughter and sidekick sophia she's a oh hi yeah she's a she's a budding computer scientist and i'd like to introduce our first special guest sal khan if you're like the many tens of millions of students who've ever learned something interesting on khan academy sal is the founder and ceo he's a good friend and he's one of my personal inspirations for why i started code.org sal how are you good how are y'all doing hey sophia hey heidi hi there and where are you calling us from i am calling from the walkin closet in our master bedroom this is actually where khan academy started so in some uh strange way a covet has got us back to our roots in mountain view california and that's great and what's been the impact on khan academy with school closing and so many students being at home well uh you can imagine you know when we started seeing the schools uh well we we initially saw a traffic peak in in in places like uh taiwan and south korea because that's where they saw the first wave of of obviously kovid and some of the closures and then uh we saw when that first week that the u.s closed and then really much of the world our traffic since then has been about 3x of what it typically has been and so we've just been trying to you know make sure that everything is up and running and then trying to figure out how to support folks in in more ways and i know you all are doing that as well and i guess this is part of it yeah yeah it's been difficult for all of us uh this week is a very special week it's teacher appreciation week uh do you have any thoughts you'd like to share with the teachers or the parents who are on the call or students yeah you know i think well i think there's a couple of layers there this would have been teachers appreciate teacher appreciation regardless of what's going on in the broader world but i think especially with uh so many students at home and a lot of it you know leaning more on us parents and on on the students i think that gives us even a deeper appreciation uh for what teachers do day in day out and i i think i can speak for a lot of you students i see a lot of great young faces out there that a lot of times you know you go to school day and day out and you can kind of take it for granted you can say oh i gotta go to school i gotta sit through this class but now that you don't have it i'm hearing from a lot of young people that they really miss it and they really miss those teachers and they really miss those engagements i think we're all appreciating teachers that much more and i know a lot of teachers are doing heroic efforts to continue to support uh all of us uh as we go through this covid crisis i know my kids you know the teachers are really making themselves available and are kind of doing whatever they can to get us through this so yes teacher appreciation a week takes on special special meaning uh right now you know personally and especially if i were to you know there's a lot of teachers that have had very meaningful impact in my life but you know two especially when i think about on the coding side of things since this is a code.org event uh i remember uh dr uh sorry mr hernandez was my algebra 2 teacher but he's the first one i actually i didn't have a computer but i was fascinated by it and and he actually introduced me to programming my calculator uh which you know i still they have these ti and that's actually where i discovered a love for programming and then at the local university uh dr santania i was taking classes at university of new orleans i must have been about 15 years old and he saw that i really cared about like i was really intrigued by computing and he kind of made up an internship for me so that i could program on the computers at the university uh and if he hadn't done that for me uh you know who knows the world would have been might have been very different khan academy wouldn't have existed if i didn't have the coding skills to at least build it in those early stages and i wouldn't have had those coding skills or the confidence to do it if dr santania didn't let me use his computers because i my family couldn't afford one so a lot of teachers played a big role in my life and and especially on that computing side of things that's beautiful and pretty much any but if you ask them why did they like what was their favorite subject and why the reason is usually because of that teacher so we're going to talk about teacher appreciation week throughout the episode but let's start with the computer joke of the day with sophia okay um what do you call it when a computer science students make fun of each other a computer computer science students make fun of each other i don't know what do you call it the answer is cyber boolean cyber boolean cyber boolean and boolean is one of our words of the day today and we're going to learn about that in a bit uh since khan academy has so much math instruction this week we're also going to have a math joke since oh wait you already said that okay what is the scariest kind of math the scariest kind of math tell me what is the scariest type type of math the aftermath what was that the aftermath the aftermath oh yeah okay that got a little dark we wrote that joke ourselves so we want to briefly meet our uh live audience we have a dozens of students on camera so we're going to switch to gallery mode so everybody can see all of them can everybody wave and say hello and we're going to mute you so there there are a few dozen students who are on camera but there's a whole lot more students over a thousand students who are joining us in live via the zoom webinar feature i'm going to screen share briefly so we can see on the map where everybody's from so you can now see a map which shows all around the world as people were dialing in they were putting in their locations and there's people joining us from as early as 7 00 am their time all the way till 2 a.m in the in the middle of the night and all around the world it's pretty incredible and sal just so you know we have students who are joining us as young as six years old and as old as folks who are in their later years older adults in their 60s or 70s uh the the experience level with computer science ranges all the way from beginner to advanced if any of you are joining us and your advanced students please be patient we're going to start with more easy stuff first and we'll we'll get to advanced stuff later and if you're a beginner and things move too fast for you don't worry you may not be able to keep up and learn everything but if you try you'll you'll get a little bit of it and then later on when you grow up uh you'll be able to rewatch and get better at it uh the other thing i want to say is as we go through this episode if you have any questions you can post them to code.org questions and because it's teacher appreciation week if you'd like to give a shout out to a special favorite teacher just like sal did please go to this url and submit something like a shout out put the name of the teacher and where you're from and what was special about the teacher we're going to read some of these out later on in the episode to say special thanks to teachers that have impacted us today we're going to be learning about conditionals which is an important concept in computer science and computer programming and there's going to be three parts boolean expressions flow charts and then we're going to learn about if and if else statements in app lab but before we get into the lesson what i want to do is to welcome some students to demo their creations each week uh when we have our episode we send challenges out at the end of the week for students to basically do some assignments and to share their creations with us and each week when you share your creations we'll invite you back on the next episode to share what you created and and so that's what we're going to be looking at now and let me share my screen in just a second to show the questions from this past week all right uh so here we have a creation from adit who's from bangalore india it's too late at night for adid because he's 10 years old but what he created was he used protocols to send binary information to create these pixel images to spell out coding is cool uh the other thing the other submission we have oops excuse me the other submission we have is from willow who's eight years old from whitley bay in the united kingdom and since we learned about protocols she sent she created a message sending protocol we're going to play her video briefly all right she's bouncing a ball and throwing it up in the air next letter right so willow's actually on the call with us willow are you there yeah could you explain to sal what you're doing in that video when you're bouncing the ball why were you bouncing the ball so instead of being placed at the light wasn't it so yeah you threw it up for a one were you sending it as a one or a zero was were some of the bounces of ones and some of them zeros yes so so the throw was a one the bounce was a zero there was a one and a bounce was a zero and then there was a click through the clicks were the time so you knew when the letter had finished and then you would go on to the next letter didn't you right well thank you so much for joining us willow i think willow's a little bit embarrassed to be in front of an audience of a thousand people uh is sylvia there with us as well sylvia i'm not sure if sylvia is on the call i'm i'm here hi sylvia where are you calling from kentucky and and what grade are you in fourth grade fourth grade can you tell us a little bit about your creation and what you sent into us well i made um endangered mammals of the arctic to bring to bring awareness about endangered animals to kids all right so you made this website uh what are these drawings did you make these yourself on google drawings oh cool and so there's polar bears or arctic boxes and if i click through i can get the actual real picture of the animals and to learn about these so we made a website about arctic animals and why they're endangered and you made little drawings of each of them and you can go them to see each of them and you made this entire website yourself on code.org web lab so if anybody missed last week's episode there's an html page for each of these pages so there's an html page for polar bears and html page for reindeer and silvia wrote the code for all these pages directly in weblab as she's learning html and css thank you so much to sylvia and to willow and to adit for sharing your creations sophia can you play an applause sound for our students right so now we're going to start learning about boolean expressions and conditionals and now the reason this is important is computers make lots of decisions both big and small for example when you're playing a game on a computer if you get a better score than last time you played the computer should change the high score or when you receive a call on your phone it fits somebody in your contacts you want to display their name or when you get an email if it has inappropriate content you want it marked as spam sometimes these could be big decisions that are made up of a lot of small decisions and how the computer works through those decisions involves something called boolean expressions which is our word of the day now south is is known for his ability to explain difficult difficult steps and difficult concepts in an easy to digest format so sal can you help explain to our students what a boolean expression is well i'll try and you set high standards but well a boolean is an expression that will result as either being true or false so for example if i were to say hadi is taller than sophia that is either going to be true or false that is a you could view it as a boolean expression uh we could we could actually pull people who thinks it's true so why don't we actually do this we're going to have sal read out a few boolean expressions and they're going to be either true or false and if you think they're true show a thumbs up and if you think they're false show a thumbs down so everybody who's in the on camera audience can do this even if you're not on camera you can do this at home and so sal uh why don't you give us a few examples of these boolean expressions true is thumbs up false is false thumbs up yeah well we could start with that warm up hadi is taller than sophia all right that was that was an easy one yes it results in a true it's a it's a so that's a boolean expression so i'll give you another warm up three is larger than four what do you think there's something interesting going on hobby i think a lot of people are seeing what other people are doing and so it's kind of a majority rule that's another phenomenon that we can see each other that's another phenomenon that we we can we can study yes of course that that is uh false okay the number of student panelists is greater than 10 true or false yes true we can clearly see in gallery mode many more than than 10 faces or and 10 thumbs up okay now we're going to get a little bit complicated uh what you're going to see is that boolean logic and when when you're coding and some of y'all have probably done this you're going to involve a lot of knots ands ors and so and that that starts to play with your head a little bit and computers are very good at it so we had to get we got to get good at thinking like that as well so we're going to combine some of these together to make a more complicated expression exactly exactly so the first one is the pacific is an ocean and the nile is a lake true or false for the whole statement all right so i'm seeing a lot of thumbs down and that's interesting because the pacific is an ocean so even though the pacific is an ocean a lot of y'all are still some okay there's a lot of confidence out there because yes it says and the nile is a lake and which we know that's false so we had a true statement and a false statement so the and since it was and the false statement made the whole thing false what if i were to say the pacific is an ocean or the nile is a lake yes that's a true that's a true because only one of them have to be true in an or both of them could be true as well but only one of them has to be true so that one works and then here we go a fish is a sea creature and a this is this is a i'm gonna read it carefully a fish is a sea creature and a cat is not a dog all right yeah because the way you do it the way at least i my brain does is i try to break down each of them i say okay fish is a sea creature okay that's true so i have something that's true and and then i read the next one a cat is not a dog it is true a cat is not a dog at least the cat's that i'm aware of and so have a true and a true and so that's going to be a true sofia has a cat that's definitely not a dog uh so let's do some of these as polls that the entire audience on zoom there's there's over a thousand people on zoom can try it as as well and we have two slightly more complicated ones that we're going to post at zoom poles uh those of you who are on facebook live or youtube live you won't see the polls where you can try answering them as well so so we could put up the first zoom pole and sal you can read it out okay five is an odd number and six is not even all right looks like i mean the group is definitely saying people are some not everybody's getting it right but i think people have the real hang of it uh but most of you have voted so if we could share the results so 95 of you got this right the the answer is false because 6 is even can we put up the next one and sal you can read it out as well not true this one plays with your brain not true is not false this one's tricky but our audience is doing a reasonably good job at it not everybody's getting it right sal do you know the answer to this one yeah well i'll tell you what my brain does when i read this i it does play with your brain a little bit when you read it the first time but you know instead of saying okay not true is not false what my brain says okay what is not true so if i say okay if something isn't true by definition it is false and so not true is false is a true statement so not true is not false is a false statement or i should i say not true is a not true is not false is a is a not true statement [Laughter] all right if we could share the results of what our team voted so 80 of you about got this correct uh for the rest of you that one was really a brain teaser and uh is a little bit kind of complicated so uh thank you so much for quizzing us on boolean expressions sal so we learned that we can combine multiple questions to make a complex decision and this is used all the time in computer programming or even life for example if i want to go hiking if if it's a weekend and it's sunny i'll go hiking and i need to check that both of those things are true in order to make my decision uh sal before we go into learning the next thing let's take a little break and learn a little bit about you uh you're our second special guest to play our new lightning round game so sophia is going to put 60 seconds on the clock and she's gonna ask you a bunch of questions quickly and sophia speak up so people can hear you well your goal is to beat our current high score of six which was set last week by keegan michael key so the quantity quantity over quality is what we're going for well you want to do both but your score is on the number but i'm only measured by quantity that's true are you ready sal i'm ready so if you're ready set go the best book you've ever read uh foundation isaac asimov what can always make you laugh uh parents probably won't appreciate this but potty humor country you've always wanted to visit behind new zealand what were your hobbies when you were a kid drawing your favorite smell rose favorite drink there's kind of a there's an indian drink called lassie which is like a mango type of smoothie sorry okay okay what are your feelings about pineapple on pizza it's great something you find yourself saying that your parents used to say i call my my my children weird words like dugubu first thing you do in the morning meditate okay it's time okay did i win you got a score of nine oh i think this app is doing an if statement now if your score is bigger than six then you have our new high score else you don't you know my meditation should make me not care about whether i want or not yeah that's true but you do now have our first time sophia you want to give him a round of applause for that all right i'd like to invite a special teacher who's joining us today in honor of teacher appreciation week flo are you there with us hello i'm here i'm here hi flo hi where are you calling us from i'm not sure if flo is there still [Laughter] you got me i'm still here all right we got you um okay great uh there you are so uh flo we had we wanted to ask you to share basically questions from our audience for sal could you read them out for us if that's possible i should i sure can so sad we have some questions from the audience and so first we have our revere in mumbai wants to know what prompted you to start khan academy oh that's a that's a good question and and nice to meet you flo and and thank you for being a teacher and the wonderful work you do uh so what prompted me to start khan academy i'll get i'll try to give the short answer i was always fascinated by education i was always fascinated by this idea that um you know some kids they seem to have all the capability in the world but for some reason they lose their confidence and i always thought that maybe it was it had nothing to do with their ability it had much more to do with it they just had gaps in their knowledge that you could fill in and so about 15 16 years ago one of my cousins who was 12 years old at the time so the same age as a lot of y'all it just came out of conversation that she was having trouble with with math in particular and so i offered to tutor her remotely she was in new orleans and i was in boston at the time and i saw with her the same you know that that if i filled in her gaps that she was able to learn anything and uh so then i was kind of hooked tutoring her so i started tutoring some other uh cousins word spread through my family that free tutoring was going on and i started making stuff for them as i said earlier you know my background was in computer science so that would empowered me to code some uh question generators for them and for me to be able to keep track of what they were doing and it was actually a friend that suggested that i start making some videos to supplement these things uh and i initially thought that was a bad idea i said you know youtube that's for cats playing piano that's not for real mathematics uh but i got over the idea that it wasn't my idea and i gave it a shot and so you know i started making stuff for my cousins and it started to become clear that people who are not my cousins were finding it useful and you know one of the really powerful things about coding is and and things like video is that they scale is that if it works for my 15 cousins maybe it could work for 15 000 people maybe it could work for 15 million people and so in the back of my mind i said hey maybe this could be a thing that could reach a lot of folks i set up as a notforprofit in 20082009 and back then it was a little bit delusional i was in this walkin closet kind of dreaming of creating uh something that could help the world it could help billions of people but we fast forward about 10 years since i quit my day job uh and you know khan academy's has about 100 million registered users and we are doing our best in conjunction with amazing partners like code.org and others and and amazing teachers around the world to try to empower as many folks as possible well as a teacher i can say that we definitely appreciate tools like khan academy being able to supplement the things that we do and to be able to fill in those gaps we have another question from another viewer in ashburn virginia and we want to or they want to know like what did you do in order to promote khan academy right like when you started it you know the online stuff was kind of still up and coming um are there any people who were reluctant to try it and how did you overcome that yeah you know a lot of people khan academy was one of you know they're in on the internet these days or even a while ago you always hear about things going viral where you know someone posts a video and then everyone starts sharing you know whatever else khan academy didn't really go viral it was more of kind of a slow word of mouth that i was putting stuff out there i think people back in 2006 2007 were doing web searches looking for help with things you know kind of i wasn't the first person to even make you know lessons on youtube uh but i think you know i there was something nice that maybe i was making for my cousins and so they felt very authentic uh and i think and people i think really resonated with with uh that i think so so that's how it grew and people started telling folks and whatever i didn't have any marketing budget or anything like that i think the the other question you know is how did i believe that this was worth doing because it is true that in the early stages of doing anything especially if you're doing something that is novel a lot of folks are going to look at you a little bit weird and say wait i don't know anyone who's done that why would that work uh and and so i definitely got a lot of that from friends and family i'd you know given up a good job uh that people thought was a legitimate job and i was living off of savings and my first son was born and so you know it was stressful and so you know you have to you can't always depend on everyone else believing in what you do you have to just say hey look i'm i'm getting some data here that this is this is beneficial for folks so i'm just going to keep sticking to it and keep believing in it and uh you know luckily it did eventually get enough traction that that folks started believing in it and started supporting it that's absolutely beautiful so thank you so much sal so as we had said earlier it's teacher appreciation week and we wanted to give some shout outs to the hardworking teachers who are finding such creative ways to to basically help keep their students engaged so we're going to share my screen for a second if you're if you haven't already submitted a testimonial you can submit a testimonial or a question for us about your favorite teacher but i'm going to ask sal and flo to read out some of the things that people have posted on on already so flo can you read the first one and then sal can go to the next one my wife and one of my best friends are teachers i also had several teachers that had a big influence on me at a young age that changed my life now seeing the importance of teachers on my own kids lives i couldn't be more proud of the work they do nacho arborist teacher not your average teachers you're better than strawberry than the guacamole to put me in a good mood that's great sal can you help us with these next two and read the shout outs to teachers let's see jonathan alsheimer says to all the amazing teachers he is in caps and school leaders who are selflessly who selflessly give their their all everyday who wake up with a passion to inspire and always look to make an impact on the lives of students we see you exclamation mark and there's this nice what the world sees teachers doing top of the iceberg what they're actually doing yep that's i think very very accurate and then chris miller and i'm gonna move these windows around so i can see chris miller wrote at the end of my driveway this morning yeah i'm a bit weepy and it says an awesome said a mocha teacher lives here we love you so chris sounds is a teacher and his community clearly appreciates him by putting that that's on his front lane and uh flo do you have any testimonials from our audience from the episode as well yes i do um here we go so we want to shout out miss molina um and she's in huntington park high school and she just wanted to say that she is the most empathetic teacher so shout out to miss molina also we want to thank our computer applications teacher for everything that she is doing during this hard time to help us succeed in our thank you for helping us with the basics of coding and how to make a simple website happy teacher appreciation day and that is from abigail in minden vermont and finally hi my name is gray i'm a seventh grader at aois rosemont and my favorite teacher is mrs smith she is the best tech teacher ever exclamation she is so canyon kind to all her students and i really appreciate her and hope that she will get the shout out she deserves well shout out ms gray all right well thank you sal and thank you to all the teachers out there who are doing amazing work uh and we're gonna switch to gallery view so we can see the entire audience and can everybody make a little heart like this for the teachers uh everywhere who are basically working hard teachers are doing some of the most important work in the world especially during this pandemic to keep our students uh engaged and learning thank you so much and unfortunately it's now time to say our goodbyes to sal sal thank you for joining us today and thank you for explaining bullying expressions to us it's an honor to have you join us on code break so could everybody wave goodbye to sal it was not not an honor it was not not an honor thank you well goodbye sal and we're going to continue on with flow flow can you quickly tell us uh you're you're a teacher in oakland right what is it that you teach in oakland math and computer science so can you tell us uh uh when you got into teaching computer science was it intimidating how did you get into it oh my wasn't intimidated absolutely um i think that at first i don't think of myself as a computer scientist um and so yeah when you look at tech companies you know you don't see a lot of people that look like me but i'm excited because computer science and mathematics have a lot of this i'm into computer science my math one of my coworkers introduced it to they were using a little turtle program to draw shapes um and i was helping them out with all the angles and things like that so the masks have a lot in common and so although it's intimidating i think that teachers should not be afraid because you know it's everywhere and we're all going to have to use it right so one thing that's exciting about flo is flo teaches at oakland school district and she began teaching computer science and then she helped get her entire school district this is an entire district where none of the classrooms none of the schools offered any computer science and just a few years ago thanks to flo's help every single school in oakland is now teaching computer science and it's become one of the most popular courses because flow helped prepare existing teachers in the existing schools whether it's math teachers english teachers history teachers or even art teachers begin teaching computer science so if you're in a school that doesn't offer computer science and coding whether you're a student or a parent you can ask your school's principal to send a teacher to code.org professional learning program so have them visit code.org and experts like flow will help prepare the existing teachers at the school to begin teaching computer science so when school starts again in the fall you'll have a computer science class and that's that training for the teachers is going to be happening over the summer so now we're going to go to the next section of learning about conditionals we're going to learn about flow charts and since uh flo is here uh with us she's gonna teach us about flow charts uh hello can you get get this going and share your screen tell us teach us how flow charts work share our screen here and of course we have to pick a teacher and make sure we turn our video on [Laughter] of course wait did i share uh you're not on screen sharia there we are okay so make sure we have our video right uh oh wait there we are yay okay so make sure you all can see me during fun with flow and flow charts listen you guys don't understand how excited i am to be doing fun with flow charts so we're going to play a game actually um that utilizes flow charts and some of the booleans that we learned about earlier remember the word of the day is boolean and a boolean is something that can be answered with a yes or no or true or false so we're going to be checking some boolean statements in this card game where we flip over cards and try to keep our score and see what our score is at the end of the game remember that our score always begins at zero so we have the first little diamond and then the first diamond our boolean is to check if the card is red so remember if it is red or it's not red right because the artist can be red or black and if the card is red and the statement returns true will you add we will subtract one from our score okay so this is the flow chart that we're going to use to play this game let's go ahead and play our first card is red three you're gonna our next card is going to be a black pin so again you're going to check the boolean to see if the card is red next we have a red seven a red seven so we're going to check to see if the card is red okay all right so that's the end of this round let's see what's our score do we have some participants who would like to share their scores so if anyone knows the answer just raise your hand we'll call on one of you let's see i see laurel raise your hand first so laurel i'm going to unmute you do you have the answer yeah i got one is that the right answer flo well yeah we're going to walk through does anybody else have a different answer or is there anybody else with the same answer let's see amishi um i got two oh amisha got two let's okay well let's go yeah let's go ahead and walk through and see um what happened so let's let's do this together so remember our score begins at zero and when we flip our first card we're going to check to see if the card is red and in this case it is true so we're going to add one to our score so now we have a score of one we are going to check our next card which was a black set a black 10 so if the card is red no that's false so we're going to subtract one from our score so now we're back to zero our next card was a red seven so we're going to check is the card red and that statement is true so we add one to our score and we end up with a score of one yay congratulations to all of you who got a score of one so now we're going to add on to our flow charts and see what happens if we can um add more statements add more booleans to the flowchart okay we're going to play the same game we're going to have our cards we're going to flip our cards and try to keep our score but this time the flow chart is a little bit different we're going to start off by checking the first boolean in the diamond if the card is red if the card is red it returns true we're going to add one to our score else if the number if that's false we're going to check if the number is greater than six and in this case we're going to check that boolean yes is greater than six no is greater not greater than six it returns true then we are going to add two to our score if that boolean returns false we are going to subtract one from our score so a little bit more going on this time um and you all are going to play so everybody's going to play because i think this time we're going to do a poll for our score so everybody's going to play everybody on the zoom call everybody on youtube everybody's gonna play okay so let's play our first card is a black state you're gonna run through the flow chart check the color value our next card is going to be a red six so we're going to check against the color and we check against the value our next card is a red 10. so we're going to check is the card read chew our fauce all right next two i hope you all are keeping your score okay so let's take a poll and see what is the score so everybody go ahead and you're going to submit your score looks like most of the folks got the right answer but not everybody so about half of the students on the call have voted and about 70 of them got it right yeah all right almost everybody has picked their answer can we share the the student guesses on the screen yes let's share all right so it sounds like most people thought it was a three but a lot of people thought it was a four or five or a six so flo can you give us the real answer absolutely let's see what let's see what the real answer is going to be and the answer is so congratulations out there to all of you who got three let's go ahead and see how in the world we hit three score so remember we begin with the score at zero our first card was a black eight so we checked if the card is read that's false um is the number greater than six not string so we're going to add two to our score so you guys can see the highlight right so you can see the path that we're taking in the flow chart we're going to add two to our score so now we have a score of two our next card is so we checked the first boolean statement in the diamond is the card read yes that's true so we're going to automatically add one to our score so now we have a score of three our next card is a red 10 and so we checked the first boolean statement is the card read that is true so we are going to add one point to our score now we have score of four our next card is the black 2 so we check if the card is red no that's false the next boolean statement says or else is the number greater than 6 no that's false so we subtract one point from our score and we end up with the score of three so that is how we ended up with the score of three right so going through the two boolean expressions and following the half of the tree we ended up with three um let's have some more fun with some charts this time let's get copy and sofia involved this is gonna be we're going to this time still be dealing with our deck of cards but first we're going to check if the card is odd so our the card is odd and again that's a true false statement um if the card is odd true then sophia will give heidi a high five if the card is not odd or false then we have something else we can do so we're going to check to see if the card is a diamond so if the card is a diamond sofia and hottie are glowing if the card is not a diamond sophia and heidi will sing baby sharks okay so um let me came up with these [Laughter] [Laughter] okay here we go here we go look as you guys can see me looking at the cards okay i won't look all right let me pick another card oh no here's the card all right can we see it uh oh flow screen is frozen what card did you get it's the nine of clubs nine of clubs can you show it again nine of clubs yes all right so it's a it's it's an odd number oh perfect ready set okay stop there so we can see in the spring all right just give each other a high five sophia and i got off really worried we're gonna need to sing baby shark sophie do you want to sing baby shark anyway all right maybe not all right well thank you so much flo so flo showed us how if statements and flowcharts work and testing boolean expressions to be true now that's not something you do just on flowcharts it's a really important concept in computer programming and we tell the computer specifically what to do if something is true or false uh we're going to demo this uh soon in our app lab but first we want to do quick trivia time sophie are you ready for today's trivia question so let's put up today's trivia question how did boolean expressions get their name number one they were named after the famous boolean bridge option two the mathematician george boole invented them and option three once a ghost scared a computer science named leanne and named boo and yelled boo leanne i'll give you a hint option three is one that sophie and i wrote ourselves but if you like it you can vote for it even if it's not true i love that people are voting for the ghosts yeah that's what i did so you voted for two sophia all right so most of you have guessed let's share people's guesses and as most of you guessed correctly uh yet there is no such thing as a boolean bridge and there weren't and there aren't any ghosts ghosts are not real boolean expressions were named after george bull and some interesting facts to share george bull is a mathematician who lived during the 1800s he came up with boolean logic long before computers even existed two other interesting things about him george bull taught himself he actually didn't graduate from high school he taught himself math and reading and writing and then he actually started his own school as a teacher became a famous mathematician and then became a math professor at queen's college even though he never had any degree so those of you who are learning and studying at home you can get really far studying all by yourselves and then lastly if you think you are famous because boolean expressions are named after you george's wife was named mary everest and mount everest was named after her dad so this is a really unusual couple where one of them's had their name was made for boolean logic the other the world's tallest mountain was named after them so pretty interesting stuff so now that we've learned about boolean logic i want to go into app lab and show how we can use if statements and we're now in the third part of our episode where we're going to learn about if statements we're going to make an app right now on the show to use these kinds of if statements byebye sophia is going to say goodbye to us and i'm actually going to be joined by my son darius hi hi darius that was a quick switcheroo there is how old are you i'm 14 middle school you're 13 in middle school all right so we're going to do a quick screen share and show darius's screen we're going to show app lab over here and so this here basically shows the app that we're working on what you see on the left side of the screen is the app where we're in design mode and we can actually basically build the app on the right side of the screen oops my screen share messed up so i'm going to do that again i'm going to screen share again so what you see on the left side of the screen is the app that we're building and what we're creating is a magic eight ball so it's gonna look like this if you've seen in the video it's one of these eight balls where if you shake it it's going to give you a special answer that shows up uh like that and that answer is going to be basically to answer a question you ask a yes no type of question and it's going to tell you whether your answer is yes or not kind of like a crystal ball uh so first things first let's make this thing actually look like an eight ball so in this middle part we're gonna click on this big button this is a circular button but darius if you could actually change the button to have a black border okay so here we go and then change the border width it's two pixels wide can you make that a wider border okay yeah yeah much wider that's a thick border make it a little bit thicker oops what just happened what happened our page is reloading we're learning an important computer science concept called debugging all right i guess we need to start over go back into design mode and click the button and change the border color again to black and then the border width 75 that's like a nice number right so now we have our eight ball uh can you also change the font color in the button so uh basically a little bit higher up here the text color can you change that to whatever color you'd like i'll make it blue all right blue sounds good right so now we have an eight ball that basically when you click on that button we want it to do something so when you click on this we wanted to give us a kind of a yes no answer so if you could go to code mode and we're gonna write the code for what happens and it's going to have an if statement in there testing a boolean expression but first we want to check when the button gets clicked so drag an on event block and you're going to test and this on event block is going to be an event handler when the 8 ball is clicked so click the id and say when magic eight ball is clicked what are we gonna do we want to then basically pick a random number to decide a random answer that the eight ball is going to give us how many answers do you want it to give us three up to three different answers right so we're gonna pick a random number from one to three and store that number in a variable so click on variables and declare a new variable so variable x equals and then in that little blank spot we want to pick a random number so go into the math tab and choose a random number and if you want to have three different options you can go a random number from 1 to 3 instead of 10 but we can make as many as we want so now x is going to be a random number each time you click on the button we'll get a random number we want to test if x equals one and this is where we use our boolean expressions we can give one answer and if x equals two we can give a different answer and so on so go under control and pick out an if block and in that little blank part type x equals one but this is really important you need to use two equal signs because we're programming in javascript this is one of the most annoying and difficult aspects of computer programming is in many languages such as javascript c c sharp java you need two equal signs when you're testing the value of something if you use only one equal sign it's gonna break your code so if x is one we wanna show an answer for the magic eight ball so you can now set the text inside the button so go into ui controls and pull out the set text block so if x is one you want the magic eight ball to say something like uh do you want to give it a positive answer it will like yes so give like a stronger yes like definitely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely yes all right so if x is one it'll say absolutely yes so and if x is not one we want to do something else how do we test if x is not one uh flow can you help us out here what should darius do to to add the opposite case of the else clause if x is not one well if we want to add um the else clause then we need to click on the little plus of the uh if block and that will bring out the else and we can actually click on it a couple times so we can be able to add all of our statements inside that block like this all right so after clicking the plus twice so now you can test if this if so if x is not one else if x equals two and again two equal signs now we can put a different types of text so now set text all right so the you want a different answer like probably not probably not all right and then in the last case do we need to test if x equals three no because there is one other answer possible so it doesn't matter all right so now then you set text and change the text the magic eight ball to like nope or something nope all right so now we've got our magic 8 ball uh built and we can play it so i'm going to run with this magic 8 ball and ask some questions about my son darius so did darius enjoy coding in front of an audience of a thousand people i'm gonna click oh that's sad nope no he did not oh come on uh does darius love computer science probably not does darius love his father nope darius uh is darius gonna come back on the next code break episode no okay at this point i should have said absolutely like the odds are against us is it gonna give us a good answer nope all right if i say something bad say something bad is darius gonna get punished probably not is it gonna rain today absolutely all right well you can see how simple it is to make this magic 8ball game and uh if you want this on your own phone you can click the share button uh and then send to phone and it actually shows a qr code so if any of you are in the audience you can actually use your phones and scan that qr code and the magic 8ball app that we built will be on your own phone and you can play it yourself if you don't scan it right now we're actually going to send this to you so you can actually make your own but i want to also show you how simple it is to use the exact same code to make a very different app than the magic eight ball so here's an app that's a dice game basically it rolls a dice and gives you an answer and you can see when you click the button roll dice it's going to pick another random number from 1 to 6 it will play a sound and show the number that we rolled and if the dice value is greater than 3 it'll say u1 else it'll say you lost this is a lot like the card game that flow just made so if you roll the dice it gives you six and says you won and you roll the dice again it gives you a two which is less than not greater than three and i'll say you lost that's a super simple game but what's nice about this game is you can build on it and make it more complicated and we're going to ask you to try doing some of these things so for example here's a multiplayer version of it where player one gets one roll player two gets another roll and whoever gets a higher number wins so you roll the dice and player five wins and player two loses five sorry player one and you roll again and player two wins and you can make this even more interesting uh this is the more advanced version where each player gets two dice and instead of showing numbers they're actually going to show the image of a dice and so darius and i are going to play this i'm going to be player one and you'll be player two okay sounds good all right i'll roll the dice and i got a seven you got a seven so we tied and i'll roll it again i got five plus fours and nine so this time i finally won uh and as you can see you can add more to this you can make your game enter the names of the players instead of just being a win or a loser you can keep score and see how many scores a player gets these are basically all changes you can make super simply the beautiful thing about computer programming is it starts with just those few blocks but then you can add on it so we actually are going to challenge you to do some of these things in app lab yourself so if you've given us your email we'll send you this week's challenges if you haven't already given us your emails go to code.org break and enter your email address and what we'll send you is first some practice you basically use if else statements to make a honey bee learn how to get honey and that's something you can even do on a mobile phone and for older students you can do a code along to create the magic 8 ball app and then for your challenge there's two options if you don't have a computer or if you're younger you can make flow charts and pen and paper and for older students we're going to challenge you either to modify the magic 8ball app or to build your whole old dice roller game make it twoplayer add images add the the concept of keeping score and so on when you're finished with these share it with your parents and if they have social media we'd love for you to share your creations on social media with hashtag codebreak or email it to us and as always we're going to invite the the folks who submit stuff onto next week's episode to demo their creations these the things that we're asking you to do always include unplugged activities for students who don't have computers at home or for students who are working on a on a smartphone so we're done with today's episode i wanted to give a last chance to thank flo our special guest who is a teacher and a thank you to all the teachers so as we go to gallery view can we please all again hold our hearts out for all the teachers out there darius can you show a heart let's show hearts for all teachers who are working so hard to keep students all around the world learning thank you so much flo for joining us and everybody if you're studying alone take a code break we'll see you all next week thank you bye bye you
