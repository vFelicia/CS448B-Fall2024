everybody stay together hour of code that's awesome uh we're broadcasting this Live on YouTube as well so we're going to have a whole bunch of people sort of other classrooms around the world are going to be joining in and listening uh but there's about four classrooms there that can get to to see and talk with me uh live inside this sort of there's already a 15 other classrooms from around the world watching in on this as well uh actually now there's already 20 classrooms I expect we'll get up to about 50 or 100 other classrooms besides you all watching uh my name is Hadi I'm the the guy who created the hour of code uh this is something that started as an idea just three and a half years ago uh you know I started code.org because of the idea that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science uh this is a field that is changing everything around us uh you know whether you you play with apps or games on a phone uh or whether you play games on a tablet or a computer you start using technology but technology and computers have become much more than apps or phones they're changing things like transportation and cars communication entertainment banking shopping everything in the world around us is being changed by computers and Technology but our schools our schools don't teach how computers work they don't teach computer science or coding so the reason we started code.org in the hour of code is to help students in schools get access to this field all of you watching right now and there's there's now about 40 classrooms now here watching all of you are learning to code in your school but your parents never got a chance to do that your teachers never had a chance to do that this is the first generation of not only Americans but across the world it's the first generation of students that are getting to learn coding and computer science in school and the way this started was just with this very simple idea three and a half years ago I had this idea of what if you know since schools don't teach us what if every student in every classroom in every country in the world could just do one hour of computer science and coding if we started with one hour I bet the students will love it I bet the teachers will love it and then it can spread at three and a half years later that idea has exploded the hour of code has now reached 300 million hours have been done one out of every 10 students in the entire world has done the hour of code just right now we have about 40 classrooms watching this but right at this moment over ten thousand classrooms right now are doing the hour of code in every single country from Florida to Alaska in this country but also worldwide from the southern tip of Chile Chile to the northernmost tip of Siberia in Africa they're doing it in Australia they're doing it in refugee camps in the Middle East students globally are doing the hour of code it's such an amazing thing to have started something that has grown big enough that it's being done globally and it's not just about one hour computer science starts with one hour everything starts with the first hour but the real point of it is after one hour you kind of get hooked you realize this is really fun and then you want to do a lot more than one hour and the real goal of the hour of code is to teach computer science in America's schools this campaign is just three years old and it's amazing how big it is the fact that it's gotten so big is really more than anything else thanks to the teachers worldwide but especially in the United States that have decided to take and embrace this idea of the hour of code so I just really wanted to give a thank you to all of the teachers out there if you're watching can you first say thank you and give a round of applause to your teachers so say thank you and the reason we're thanking the teachers is because your teachers never learned coding when they were in school themselves usually when your teachers are teaching you math or English it's teaching you something they've learned and they're having to take their own sort of jump to teach something that they're not necessarily good at and it's not easy to try to teach something you never learned and we're all learning in This Together uh you know since since I just started this is that I didn't want to just give a speech I wanted to let you guys ask some questions so uh why don't we have Angela's classroom ask a question okay and say your name and where you're from hi my name is Hunter and I'm I'm in fifth grade here at Discovery in Minnesota hi Hunter and my question is did you think that you would do stuff with computers when you got when you got older when you were in fifth grade actually that's a great question uh I started coding right around when I was your age uh I first started coding when I was 10 years old uh and you know I grew up in the Middle East in a country called Iran and I was living there actually during the war so literally my neighborhood was getting bombed every other night much like if you see on the news the stories of people getting bombed in Syria and my dad when they brought home a computer and he said you know here's your new toy but it doesn't have any apps it doesn't have any games but here's a book and you can teach yourself to code and if you get good at it then you can make your own apps and make your own games uh and I got you know I fell in love with it I was pretty much exactly your age and I got really good and then when I came to the United States you know my family was an immigrant family and we didn't have a lot of money but when I was about 13 years old when my friends in school started you know getting jobs at restaurants gas stations I started getting internships of tech companies to help pay my way through school and University that I've always loved coding because it's fun because you get to create things you get to make whatever you want and you're just the right age to get started learning it we have one more question okay hi my name is City I'm here at Discovery in fifth grade I live in Minnesota my question is how did you feel when you created org uh creating code.org has been the best feeling in the entire world you know it's everybody likes to create things everybody likes to do things that have impact that that change the world a little bit you know even if you make something with silly putty out of clay or if you draw a picture and it's beautiful you feel proud of yourself you feel great that you made something that didn't exist until you made it uh I've I have this amazing fortune that I've made something that has touched a hundred million people in every single planet on Earth it's it's unbelievable there's there's nothing that that can possibly beat that it's I feel like the luckiest person in the world I have the coolest job in the world uh and really it's thank you it's thanks to the teachers and the schools that have decided that this idea is good enough that they welcome me into your classrooms and the the services and products and ideas we bring to get to change the schools of the entire world it's the coolest feeling ever yeah and I also want to say that if any of you decide you have an idea that you want to change the world by far the best way you can change the world is with coding and computer science obviously you can do lots of things in your life but if you want to do something that has the most impact that reaches the most people the best way you can do that is with coding and computer science because if you write a great app or a great website or a great service you can reach 100 million people with that and there's almost nothing else that can do do that right let's switch to leticia's classroom hello my name is hello my name is Danielle and I live in California when you are saying that you got your computer from your dad when you got your computer from your gas and your dad was saying so make your own apps and games what was your first app or game that you made that's a great question uh and hi there and hi to the classroom from California I'm in California today as well uh the first code I wrote was just really simple you know just like if you do the hour of code if you think what's the very first two lines of code you write with with code.org stuff it's usually move forward move forward turn left and that's it it's not it's not really special so the very first app that I made was in the programming language called basic and all it did is it said hello I just asked the computer to say hello and the computer said hello and I was like great but then you could say repeat 10 times say hello and then the computer said hello 10 times and then like any kid I was you know 10 years old I said repeat ten thousand times say hello and then the computer said hello 10 000 times in a row uh and that's really the power of seeing how computers work that you can tell it to do something 10 000 times or a hundred thousand times and it doesn't get tired uh the first real app I made that I can remember is I made an app that could play music because I love to play the piano uh and you know I was reasonably good at playing piano but I wrote an app where I could take the music of the piano pieces that I wanted to play and I would type the notes into the computer and then the computer would play the piano that I wanted to play back for me cool thank you thank you for your question Leticia does your classroom have any other questions hi this is Michelle mom from Chicago how are you hi there so we're at kindergarten class so I wanted everybody to just kind of say hello we had a couple who were actually a little bit of frightened to ask a question the two fighters so we're kindergarten class but I got the same traffic Academy in Chicago we had an earlier class I didn't have a few questions if I can all right I muted you guys because nobody else will be able to hear my answer so your question is why did I make this so much fun why did I put the fun pieces into code.org I would say the people standing right behind you those little kids are the reason I made it so much fun uh because you know learning itself is fun but just getting started you need a little bit of a push you know you don't start reading English by learning Shakespeare if you wanted to start learning English by reading Shakespeare it's really not that fun you start by reading fun stories and little easy stories and then you get into harder stories and then you know the biggest books you read at the end of high school are long and hard and you actually enjoy them but it takes some time to learn enough that you can enjoy those books similarly with coding if you wanted to jump into writing C plus plus or JavaScript the very first thing you'd say is oh my God this is too hard I can't do it if it's not fun but if you start by coding with Minecraft or Anna and Elsa or Moana or Star Wars the first experience you have is this is awesome and I want to do more of it and then over time you can do the harder stuff quick show of hands how many people there have done either the Frozen Star Wars Minecraft or Moana tutorials for the hour of code a lot of you have done those right let's go back to leticia's classroom because I there's a student there waiting to ask a question um hi my name is Zach and I'm from California and were you introduced to any technology before the computer like you like were interested before but sure before I started doing computer programming uh I started actually doing what using what's called a programmable calculator uh which is like the lamest computer you could possibly program on uh you know because it was a calculator had like 20 buttons and it could just show numbers that's it but I started making really simple programs that could count from one to ten so just the calculator would say one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and that was like my program um but you know this was in the 1980s so the technology that you could have growing up in Iran was pretty limited you guys are also lucky guys and girls are so lucky to have so much technology at your disposal the fact that there's smartphones and tablets and computers and every one of you growing up is going to have one or more of those things you are so lucky but that also means you'll have the experience every one of you to learn how to create not just use the technology and that's really what this is about all right let's switch to Michael's classroom hi there I'm Eva I'm in third grade and my question is what was your favorite thing about my favorite thing about what um you know my favorite thing about coding is the creativity uh and you know the fact that you can think of your own ideas and then bring them to life and make it the way you want it to be and in fact you know if you if you do the hour of code some of those activities are creative some of them are less creative so for example you know the Moana tutorial if you use that you're solving puzzles trying to get Moana to the fish or together past the uh you know the little bad guys but at every single time you're solving the puzzle you're doing what the what you know what Moana is supposed to do but if you use the Frozen uh tutorial or the Minecraft tutorial or the Star Wars tutorial or the Flappy Bird tutorial you can make your own rules you can completely change it you know if you if you use the Minecraft tutorial you can make the the Sheep lay gold instead of eggs you can make this I'm sorry you can make the chickens lay gold you can make the sheep chase zombies your ability to make the world what you want it to be is what I like the most because most of the time when you're living in the world you have to follow the rules whereas when you're coding you can make your own rules and there's almost nothing else where you get to make your own rules I think it's kind of fun to make your own rules and thank you so much uh let's switch to I'm not sure who this next classroom is Mrs somebody Mrs E moan I think Mrs Monroe oh hi hi um we had our questions written out and you've kind of answered some of them but we'll see if you have a different answer go ahead Julia hi my name is Joanna and I'm here from New Jersey why do you think it is important for kids to learn how to code that's a really great question uh and it's so cool to see students from Minnesota to New Jersey to California all during the hour of code and I also wanted to say kids are doing this in every single country so it's not just in this country and that's what's so incredible about this uh so you know these these video chats are worth with students living in America partly because we all speak English and we're all in the same time zone but just earlier today in in Great Britain in France in Germany in Italy students were doing the hour of code and then earlier than that in Russia and in Japan it's kind of amazing um and so the question you asked is why is this important why are we learning to code um you know the fundamental reason is school is supposed to teach you how the world works and it's supposed to teach you how to learn uh and you know in school you learn things like how plants make fruits uh you know how plants make sugar using the leaves from water you learn how electricity works you learn all these things about the different parts of the world but School traditionally doesn't teach how technology works it doesn't teach how computers work and if you look at the world around us everybody is using computers and it's changing our world in so many different ways it's not just changing the world like the games you play You Know the Way technology is changing the world the future of medicine is going to be about technology today when you look at when you go to a doctor the doctor when he wants to find out what's wrong with you he or she will will look inside your eye and look inside your ear and bang on your knee and they're trying to find out what's going on inside your body you can't find out what's going on inside the body by banging on the knee in the future a doctor is going to get a pinprick of you put in a computer the computer will analyze the blood look at all the genes inside the blood compare them with a database and then just say here's the disease and here's the Cure and that's just one example of how all of medicine is going to be changed because of computers medicine is changing Commerce is changing transportation is changing agriculture is changing already today almost all the farms in this country are going to and worldwide will change because the tractors are going to start driving themselves and somebody who wants to be a farmer today they need to drive the tractor tomorrow they'll need to code the tractor and just like you say you go to to an Anna and Elsa or Angry Bird to move forward turn left the farmers of Tomorrow are going to be tying the tractor move forward move left you know go all the way to the fence and then take a ride and then take a left and the job of farming is going to be more like coding so the reason to learn it is to understand how our world works today and to be prepared for all the changes that will happen in the jobs of the future you guys have another question there yes um which of the puzzles are you most proud of but my most proud of um you know it's so amazing by the way to have been in charge of building these these you know puzzles and tutorials you know it started with our Angry Birds and Plants versus Zombies stuffed and Flappy Bird Minecraft Moana Star Wars uh Frozen all these different tutorials we've made uh and it's amazing that they've been used literally by a hundred million people I mean just to put that in perspective a hundred million people have used our puzzles that's more than all of the students in the United States plus all of the students in Italy France Germany Paris most of Europe add up all of those students that's about 70 million people we've had 100 million people use these puzzles my personal favorite is the Star Wars puzzles um but that's just because it's mine and there's there's the reason I like that is because I grew up as a Star Wars fan when I was little when I was uh you know 10 or so and I had never even seen the movies because I lived in Iran and we didn't actually have access to movies uh but I had gotten the books so I read book about the movies and I was like oh these these movies must be so great and one day I'll get to live in America and see them uh and so the fact that I could not only come to America and see the movies but then make the coding game based on the movies and then launch that as part of the new Star Wars movie launched last year was the biggest movie launch of all time and code.org was part of that movie launch for the new hour of code tutorial that was one of the most special things I could do let's switch to Nicole's classroom because we may be running out of time from uh West High School in Utah hi Richard uh my question is how many hours did it take to make hour of code that's a great question um well you know the strongest thing about hi uh the strongest thing about the hour of code isn't what we've made it's just the idea uh you know you can make lots of things you can make a car you can make a painting you can make an app but one of the most incredible things you can make is an idea and I remember very well it was June 27th of 2013 three and a half years ago when the idea for the hour of code kind of came together and I immediately knew this is the best idea I will ever have in my life I literally started calling people saying I just had the best idea ever that we're just going to get every student in the world to do just one hour of code and that the reason that idea is is important is because even if we hadn't made the tutorials even if we hadn't done all the pieces we've done teachers Educators politicians celebrities parents everybody has agreed that this is a good idea and the success of the hour of code isn't because of what we've done the success of the hour of code is because of all the people who've decided this is such a great idea we want to make it happen the fact that in Russia the minister of education has said it's a rule that every school in Russia must do the hour of code in an island in the Indian Ocean they've decided that every single mom dad child teacher every single member of the entire island has done the hour of code that's not because of anything I've done in terms of how many hours I've put into it it's just because it's such a great idea now in terms of the tutorials we make you know we have a team at code.org that works very hard on making the hour of code tutorials on the marketing on the event kits uh so and it's one of the you know I've I've worked the hardest I've ever worked over the last three years to make this campaign a success but the true success of the campaign is because it's an idea that it's captured the imagination worldwide of Educators parents leaders and and even students and even in Utah uh Nicole does your classroom have another question yes we do thank you hello my name is Harley from West High School I'm in ninth grade and my question is what jobs do you see like coming up for computer science when I graduate I'm sure that's a great question um you know we and this is probably more relevant to the older students I'm guessing The Kindergartners there are not really thinking about the jobs when they graduate uh but you know we're living at a time when not just in America but around the world people are a little bit worried about jobs uh you know we just went through an election that was a big deal for this country and a huge theme of this election was jobs and people worrying about will they get to keep their jobs or have they lost their jobs or so on and the reason for that is the jobs in this country and the rest of the world are changing uh the one good thing to know is almost every other field is is a little worried about the jobs the computer science field has the most jobs and the highest paying jobs in the country and it's not just jobs as coders right by there uh it's jobs in every field from medicine to transportation to to agriculture to entertainment all the jobs in the future are going to involve some amount of coding in computer science so please stick with it uh while that classroom prepares to leave I'll just give some closing remarks I just wanted to say thank you all for joining me thank you for participating in the hour of code getting to created something that has reached every span of the earth and so many students has been the most delightful personal experience and it's thanks more than anything else to all the teachers the Educators who've basically taken this campaign and made it what it is uh there's about 40 classrooms watching this but over 10 000 other classrooms that are coding right now just in the in the 20 minutes we've spoken almost a hundred thousand students have done the hour of code uh so thank you all for doing this and give another round of applause for your teachers and goodbye thank you
