this is a conditional block the code inside a conditional block runs if a condition is true in puzzles with conditionals we might want to check a condition like if path ahead this code will only move forward if there is a path ahead you can use conditionals in lots of different ways like this or this what if you want something else to happen if a condition is false you can use an ifelse block for that this code will move forward if there is a path ahead otherwise it will turn left your code will either move forward or turn left but never both this is helpful if you want your code to make decisions based on certain conditions here are some more ways you can use conditionals in ifelse blocks if you want to add more conditions to your block you can do that with a block that looks like this this block will check two conditions with this code if the score is equal to 5 the actor will say you have 5 points otherwise if the score is equal to 10 the actor will say you have 10 points otherwise the actor will say get more points remember only one set of instructions will run if you're ready let's give it a try you
