You already know how Sprite Lab can be used to put sprites on the screen and make them move or interact with the user. If you want your program to tell a story or give the user some instructions, you'll need to add text. Sprite Lab has a print block that puts messages on the screen. Let's drag it out and type in something to show. Print blocks work great with event blocks, including the ones you've already learnt. To make your text more interactive, you'll need to understand a little bit about variables. A variable is a container like a box, except instead of storing objects, it can store information like text or numbers. Just like a box, it's important to label the variable to know what's inside. To use the information inside the variable, you'll need to remember the label you gave it. When a computer wants to collect information it uses a prompt. In Sprite Lab, this prompt block asks the user a question and stores whatever they type inside a variable. To use the information from the prompt right away, drag out the "when answered" block. To show the information on the screen, connect the variable block to the print block. You can also combine that information with other texts. Now your program can ask the user a question and generate a personalized response. Adding text to your program can make it more engaging. With variables, you can prompt the user for information, then store it for later. Programs that use variables can give us a more customized and interactive experience.
