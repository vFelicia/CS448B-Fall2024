my name is Ali Chase and I am an oceanographer at the University of Washington I study microscopic plankton in the water near the ocean surface even these teeny tiny organisms have evolved and adapted to survive in an everchanging World animals of all sizes adapt to their surroundings over time adaptation is a special physical feature or behavior that helps an animal survive for example a giraffe evolved over many thousands of years to have a long neck to reach leaves up high in the trees whales have adapted to their surroundings by migrating to warmer climates in the winter adaptations usually take hundreds to thousands of years that's a very long time with the power of computer science you can create simulations of animal adaptations to animate how different animals have changed with the click of a button these lessons end with a series of challenges like how might an animal adapt to their surroundings if the Earth suddenly got too hot or too cold you get to imagine and code what that might look like have fun seeing how your favorite animals adapt
