Advice I would give teachers who are teaching this course for the first time, is one look over the curriculum, take a look at the different units, go through the activities, through the lesson plans, check out all of the resources created for you. There are Powerpoints, lesson plans, guiding questions. And if you already know a lot about computer science, you can take those lesson plans and modify them for the way that you teach. I think the major thing that comes up when talking to different teachers, is this fear of being vulnerable in front of our students, because we're used to needing to have all the answers and knowing everything, and them looking to us to give them all the answers. I think it's very important in computer science classes that we encourage them to try to find those answers themselves. Take a risk. Be willing to make mistakes in front of your students. It will do wonders for your classroom culture as you build that. And secondly, use the resources provided. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. The resources are there for you. It's definitely scary letting go of being the person who knows everything, to be the person who's facilitating the ideas and then problem solving with the students on how to solve those ideas. It's exciting, it's fun, as students start to realize "We're all in this together". It becomes less of me telling them what to do, and more of us trying to figure out how to solve a problem. Students will always know more than you. Provide a space where they can learn and support them in what their projects are. At first, it's nervewracking, it's scary, but then you get that excitement back when you first started teaching. If you can stay one step ahead of your students, you'll be golden.
