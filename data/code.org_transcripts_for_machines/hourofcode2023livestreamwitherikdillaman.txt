good morning everyone thank you all for joining welcome welcome we're g to give a few minutes for everyone to join get settled while we do that I just wanted to share with everybody we would love to hear your questions you can send them in the chat here on Zoom at any time or you can go to bitly to question or scan this QR code we want to know what is on your mind tell us how you're celebrating our code or how was your weekend did everybody have a good weekend we're so excited to see you here have you here with us through this very first early moment of our code the best week of the year am I right all righty hope we get your questions in send those to us anytime I might throw in a couple of those throughout the call throughout this live stream and we'll definitely save some time for Q&A later at the end so today we have something very special in store for all of you I'm GNA pause this music we have a very special guest he is one of our talented super talented content curriculum content developers at c.org and typically works on curriculum for grades 6 through 12 and has been working on CSP CSC aai for English language arts and is currently working on a computer vision model to incorporate sensors please join me in welcoming Eric fan welcome Eric thank you for joining us hey everybody how's it going so good to be here I um am so excited to be able to introduce to you something amazing that we've been working on here for the hour of code which is the dance party AI Edition so I'm going to share my screen and we are going to walk through it together now if you have a computer or uh something that you can follow along with that would be amazing because as I walk through this dance party and we create some awesome beats and create some awesome moves together you can do it on your own as well so navigate if you're going to follow along go ahead and go to code.org and when you get to the homepage you're going to see this up at the top the hour code is here dance party AI Edition to get into the dance party you're going to click see what's new the teal button and you can see we got a bunch of cool songs uh we're going to definitely be hearing some of those this morning um and when you scroll down you will see choose your dance party and you can click this button where it says start start dance party AI Edition and when I click that it is going to bring me to a video let's take a look at some of that together hi my name is mural Codi and I'm a dancer software developer and creator of illuminate computer science relates to creativity in numerous ways immeasurable really I mean once you have the ability to write software you can put ideas into anything I do it with light suits there's so much you can do once you have the tools to write software and it's the possibilities are really endless over the next hour you're going to get started with computer science and artificial intelligence by coding your own dance party we've assembled some hip music and a team of great dancers for you to play with all right so that's what we're going to be doing together uh we're going to be creating this dance party um whenever you get to these screens uh there are going to be 10 different levels for you to navigate through in order to navigate between them you can use this bar at the top or you can press this continue button down at the bottom and that's what I'm going to do right now so when I press that it's going to bring me here I need to select my age you go ahead and do that as well and then I'm going to click okay it's going to bring me to a screen that looks like this this even though you can't tell that there's a very hip dance party about to happen in the screen it is it's all behind the scenes and it's ready to go so first things first let's take a look up at the top where it says instructions now I'm going to drag this down a little bit see the cat here and it says add blocks to create your dancer and code them to do a new dance move click run to start dancing now where do I begin well luckily there is a popup right here that says start here so that's going to give me a clue as to where to begin I'm going to click the X to get rid of that and I need to create a dancer so I'm going to grab this red block that says make a new cat at Center and I'm going to drag that I'm going to click and drag that block and I'm gonna drop it over here into where it says workspace now I can drop it anywhere but in order to make the answer appear I need to drop it in the middle of this setup block and when I do that you'll notice that magically this cat appears over on the side now I get it maybe you're not a cat person maybe you prefer sloths so if you were to click this box where it says cat I can you can actually select a different dancer so in this case I'm going to select sloth and now over here um you'll notice that my cat is up here and he says click Start or click run to start dancing but he also has this little um light bulb above his head so I'm GNA click that and it's gonna say hey do you want a hint so anytime you get stuck trying to get through one of these levels you can always click that cat and the cat will give you a hint so it says the dancer should be the same on both blocks and the sequence is important ah because not only did I create a dancer in this case the sloth I need to make that sloth do a dance move so I'm going to drag this next block over I'm glad that I read that hint and it says the dancers should be the same on both blocks so I selected the sloth up here down here it's the cat need to make sure that I select sloth down here and then this is the fun part one of the fun Parts is I get to choose all these different moves I of course am going to choose the floss because that is how I start my Monday every morning flossing both you know with with my teeth and also dancing so let's give it a try I'm going to click run this orange run button over here and let's see what happens all right and once four seconds have gone by it's going to automatically say yes you passed the level and I'm going to click this continue button to move on to the next one all right so let's take a look at um some more about dance party AI edition let's learn a little bit more hi my name is hen and I'm head of the music search platform at Amazon I lead the team at Amazon music that helps you find your favorite songs we use Advanced computer technology like artificial intelligence to make sure when you need music recommendations we give you the perfect match artificial intelligence or AI is a computer program that works like human brains it takes a lot of data learns patterns from the data and makes decisions based on what it has learned AI wow okay so this is what we're going to be doing then we are going to be using this block over here which will actually use artificial intelligence to help us make decisions about the song that we choose and it will based on what kind of we interpret the song to be it's going to suggest a background that we can use that will fit the mood of the song so what I'm going to do I'm going to read the directions again that's always important right up at the top it says AI can help you create fun visual effects for your dance party so connect the the AI generate effect block to the setup and you'll notice up here now I have a new block under the block section it says generate blank effect so I'm going to drag this over I'm going to drop it here and it says click on the Block to get started so that's what I'm going to do I'm gonna hover over here and I'm G to click and it's going to bring up our code.org aibot and a whole host of emojis so we have to based on the song that we choose select three emojis that we think fit the mood so I'm actually going to come over here and look at what songs we have available so ah I really like lizo so I'm gonna select lizo and I can preview what that's going to sound like by pressing this play button next to it oh definitely all right so I'm going to click here and it's going to say based on what you heard with this song based on the mood that you you feel like the song conveys which of these emojis do you think best fit well I think that lizo was is definitely very sparkly so I'm going to put the sparkles in there uh she's definitely a queen and I don't know she's kind of like I don't know her songs are like diamond they go platinum diamond level right like she's she makes the hits so I'm going to put that and then I'm going to click the generate button let's find out what happens right now the brain of the AI is going through billions of combinations trying to figure out which of these particular uh which of these um backgrounds that are available fit these emo these emojis the best and this is what it came up with right here so I'm gonna click use effect down here and that's going to put it into my dance party and let's click run and see what happens now all right we did it moving on to our next level all right we have a moose and it says connect the AI generate effect block to setup and click on the Block to get started very similar to what we did in the last level so let's click on the cat here and see if it has any other tips for us or hints do you want a hint yes okay okay it says listen to the song and think about the mood of the music so let's choose a different one let's just let's try something different will I am all right let's listen to that really electronic it's got like a b all right oh there's some drums all right let's drag this block over one more time remember that you can select anything that you want up here so if you don't want a moose and you rather have a bear you can select the bear if you don't want the bear to be in the middle you want the bear to be at the bottom you can select where you want to position that that dancer so I'm put this bear at the bottom and the other thing is if you change your dancer here we also have to remember to change our dancer here as well so that the the dancer does the dance that we ask it to and I'm going to select uh how about clap High let's do that and when I click here that will I IM song I don't know it's it's it's got a cold beat to it it's pretty cool uh it's kind of robotic right it's like electronic music and what else I don't know like I'm gonna select this growing plant because I feel like as the song goes the beat is going to keep on growing and growing and growing so let's see what happens right now again the AI is just searching through billions of combinations trying to match the song with the emojis that I chose and this is what it came up with so what we're going to do is Click use effect and let's give it a try all right we did it again okay I think we got a handle on how to use the AI block to be able to create background so let's get a little bit more in depth then let's take a look at this video and find out a little bit more about how the AI Works behind the scenes how do you think AI Works can it read your mind is it magic is it randomly guessing actually AI knows quite a lot AI looks at billions of data points and finds associations between words with some simple math concepts applied billions of times it calculates the strength between those associations then AI uses what it learned in order to make decisions on what to generate for you my team all right so there is a lot going on behind the scenes that we're not seeing and that's okay we are going to use this block right here and we're gonna we're going to take a look first of all who likes BTS raise your hand if you do I know I do definitely good Monday morning music I'm going to click run here and just take a look at what is being generated all right and you'll notice here that once I clicked run a little message came up and it said you need to change the effect that the AI generates and you can either regenerate the effect you can customize the code that it writes or you can start over with new emojis so that's what the direction set up here so that when I clicked run I wasn't able to move on to the next level because I needed to do this step first so I'm going to click here in this box again it already has some emojis that are selected for me um we have the the chili guy we have the wave and we have the sparkle now if I don't like what's being generated here if I just don't think it fits the mood of the song I can click this regenerate button on the bottom left and that's what I'm going to do right now and again AI is going through all these different combinations it's finding associations it's making these connections and now it has uh fit it is selected this amazing Starburst pattern what if I want to see what's going on in the brain behind the scenes I can click this little graph icon in the upper right hand corner when I do that it's going to show me just just peer behind the curtain a little bit to let me know some of the choices that AI was looking at and why it selected the one that it did uh it's almost like voting um and AI is the one that's doing the voting in the situation and the way that it makes these decisions is that it trains itself to select which of these backgrounds best fit these emojis based on a ton of data and it looks at what students choose it looks at what teachers choose it looks at what it would choose and it uses all of this data to say this background must be the one so let's just go ahead and we will go back and we will say use effect right here and now when we run it stars are the thumbs up to move on to the next level so pretty fun all right let's take a look at some events what is an event let's find out hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software engineer at code.org choreographers give dancers directions on exactly when to do a dance move in dance party you'll use code to direct your dancers to move when you want them to so how do you do this think of a situation where you do something like press a doorbell and then something else happens the doorbell rings when coding your dance party you can use events to make your program respond to a key you press for example you can code an event in your dance so when the up key is pressed your dancer does a dab oh boy this is where some of the real fun begins we get to make events which as Hannah explained is when the program is listening for something to happen and in this case it's listening from input from you so that you actually get a say in what the dancer is doing and when they're doing it I see that there is a question about how do we change songs if you go up to the upper leftand corner where it says select song There's a drop down and you can see that every level that we go through this song list gets bigger and bigger and bigger it started with five songs and it looks like we're up to about 20 now um and so there's lots of choices in here if you can't find a song that you like just wait till the next level and there's probably going to be one that gets your foot tapping so I'm gonna hop in there Eric real quick because the share screen doesn't show the drop down but when you click on it you should see all of the choices there and as you click on them uh you need to click the play button to preview it so you can hear what that song sounds like uh but the next time you click run it will play the newly selected song song let us know if that didn't work in the chat and I'm happy to help you keep going yeah thanks so much da yep so yeah if you click this it'll it'll come up with a list of songs which unfortunately you weren't able to see but there are a ton there I promise you give it a try so in this situation let's read the directions again it says try it out you control the dance moves press run to start the song and then press the right or left Arrow to cue your dancers to move all right we have a couple options here if you'll notice that the bottom of the stage we see that there are some buttons with a left and a right uh button that we can click and will make the dancer move now in our actual stage over here you'll see that uh we have two new blocks that are green one says when left pressed so what do you think that means when you press the left button it will do what's below here and if you press the right button then and it'll do what's below this one so we can put different moves and assign them to different dancers so when the left is pressed the duck over here is gonna dab and when we press the right the dog is going to do the star I admit I don't know what the star is but I'm GNA learn um I can also press the right and left key on my keyboard if I'm using a keyboard okay so I'm going to click run and let's see what happens right left right right all right so you can see that uh you can have a lot of fun with that and this is how you basically get to help and interpret the dance and um be able to have it be seen on the screen so you are basically the dancer you become the dancer and again that AI block is up here and if you don't like the background that you see you can click here and and regenerate it all right I'm going to move on to the next level and in fact um I I'm GNA leave the the the the seven eight and nine for you but I want to jump to the last level uh so up at the top up here you can see I can kind of navigate through my levels here if I go to the last bubble right here it says final dance party Project screen 10 and in here this is kind of a free play level so I can uh essentially like there's going to be nothing that stops IT after 4 seconds to tell me to move on to the next level there are no instructions anymore this is me being able to take all of what I learned and experiment and get creative with my dance moves so again the the first thing I'm going to do is select a song at the upper left I'm just going to I'm going to oh Eno we don't talk about Bruno that's a good one can't go wrong with that and I can preview it if I want okay so you will notice and I don't want you to get uh too nervous about this but there are a lot of new blocks here you don't need to use all of these blocks they're just there to add add uh variety to add depth to add um just all the different things that you can think about they will help you to be creative and to create the perfect music video that you want but if you just want to focus on the blocks that you learned about in the level you can do that as well so here we already have an AI generating an awesome background effect but if I wanted to change it I could remember uh it says I'm going to going to make 12 cats new cats in a circle what do we make them uh let's put them in a diamond shape behind our main dancer right here and what if I want I don't know how about a shark let's do a dancing shark uh in the center let's put him in the in the or her I think it's a her in the bottom left yeah there we go now if I preview this this is what I'm goingon to see oh I don't know that might be a little too slow how about how about uh Kelvin Harris there we go good um if I want to include these events down here I can drag out these green event blocks right here and what if I were to put in a couple different directions here and I can make my dancers do dances when these different keys are pressed so there's a b B I don't know what a Bend is but I'm going to learn uh how about a clap high and let's do a if your teacher allows it and you have room I'd love to see everybody stand up and dance along with this last play oh yeah all right cool let's let's all do it together I I will just be here dancing and solidarity with you all okay here we go to the B go to the left clap high in clap right a and we could be together baby as SK are blue and you can see this song will play for the whole length of it you can customize it however you want totally encourage you to play around the part of the fun of computer science and using AI to create these experiences is that you get to Showcase your creativity and I can't think of a better way to spend an hour than playing around with some of these blocks over here and seeing what you can create there is no wrong answer everything that you create and every Visual and every dance move is your creation and it will be amazing so thank you so much for taking this journey with us um I love AI generated dance parties and I can't think of a better way to start Monday so thank you so much for following along and joining us on this thank you so much for walking us through that Eric I hope you all enjoyed making maybe your first maybe your H hundredth dance party but it's always a great time to dance in the Monday morning uh the kids want to know what is your favorite emoji oo what is my favorite emoji all right well I have a couple different things in in this if I were to like select one of these emojis I'd probably have to go uh for the fire because I'm just a fan of like getting like up and moving and getting excited and fire brings the energy so I'm all About That Fire awesome and you know I'm realizing uh we we didn't hear a little bit about your background can you tell us you know how you got to co.org why you care about Computer Science Education oh goodness okay well it just so happens that like I do have um maybe a little story that I can share here so back when I was younger um my brother and I we were we were products of like there was there was this this amazing transformative moment where this thing called the Nintendo came out and we became convinced that we were going to like create our own uh video game system and we were going to to like make video games and Market it and sell it uh and so well I mean I I was like in charge of doing the programming even though I knew nothing about programming my brother was going to do all the electrical engineering uh create the system even though he had no idea about electrical engineering uh and one Christmas we ended up getting uh a Commodore 64 um which was that's that keyboard is what it looks like that was the whole computer um and I was like okay this is it this is my moment I'm going to learn how to like create a video game it's going to be amazing and I remember going to the library and I found this book uh that's kind of like tucked away in the back corner it didn't look like a lot of people had used it it was called creating adventure games on your computer and I was totally stoked about that I was like I am going to do this I'm going to take this home I'm going to create the the biggest adventure game according to Tim Hartnell master gamesman and uh this is what the screen looks like when you load up the Commodore 64 a little bit different than we're used to with like Windows and Mac OS and iPhones and Android and all that uh and I typed in I think maybe like 500 lines of code into the computer and then the moment came and I pressed enter and I was like this is my moment to shine and I got uh I got an error and nothing happened and at first I was a little bit discouraged I'm not going to lie but I think it really taught me a valuable lesson that you should never give up if something is important to you and you're really interested in it that you should keep on pursuing it and so I did I kept on pursuing and by the time I got to middle school I had met some other kids that were interested in programming and we ended up creating um several different games um I'm going to put that in quot ation marks games then certainly nothing like you would play now um but we would create them and we would upload them to um well what was the internet back then and and so like you can still find some of them there to this day I love that we got a comment in from someone saying fun trip down memory lane thank you again so much for joining us Eric I would love to see everybody's dance parties if you get permission from your parents or your teachers show us your Dan smoth uh tag us with hash our code let's see what you create and have fun this week thanks everybody
