Hour of Code Minecraft | Spawn In games, spawn means the same thing as create. In this level, let's make zombies spawn when the sun goes down. To do this, we'll use the "when night" block. Since we want the zombies to spawn at night we'll add the "spawn zombie" block under the "when night" block. As soon as they're spawned, each zombie will run the code that you put in their "when spawned" event slot. Have fun spawning zombies!
