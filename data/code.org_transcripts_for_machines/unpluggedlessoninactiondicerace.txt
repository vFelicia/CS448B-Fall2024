the preparation for this one is pretty long because you actually have to go through and explain to the children how it's different to have something come out from a computer's point of view versus their point of view so it's definitely helpful if they understand how dice race works but if they don't you can use something like a magic 8 ball or yahtzee or something else that they played talk about how it looks from their point of view and then talk about how it looks for a computer to present that to them we've been talking about algorithms and we've been talking about how you can make a list of steps to explain a task and in the past we've been talking about how we can make instructions to describe things that we do every day but we're going to change it up a little bit you guys are getting older and it's time to start thinking about how you can describe tasks from the other side so instead of describing what we see when we play a game then we can start describing what the computer needs to show us and i'm going to show you how it's different are you ready okay so i'm going to give you two each a dice and we're going to have a dice race okay so you'll be number one and you'll be number two and we are going to move forward a certain amount based on what you roll we're gonna have three rolls and whoever gets the farthest at the end of those three rolls wins all right so let's go roll number one they win the glory of being the farthest in the dice race game i'm okay with that okay go four okay go five whoa okay roll number two okay you go first three three and final roll roll number three two six whoa okay so you see in the dice race game number one was the winner so now you know how to play the dice race game yeah now i need us to think of our list of steps that it takes to play that game because understanding how to play is one thing but being able to explain it step by step to someone else is another thing right so if we're going to play the dice race game what's the first thing we need to do make sure that there's a player one a player two okay so you have player one and player two and what's the score at the beginning yeah zero zero zero zero so each of them your score is zero so then what do you do yeah you will um the die once and then you get however many points so then you roll the dice and then you add that to your score and then what happens you do that three more times okay so you do this three times so does one person do all things three times all three times okay so player one does this and then player 2 does this and we do all that three times and then what happens whoever has the highest score at the end wins okay highest scorer wins does that sound about right okay so this would be the instructions if we are teaching someone else how to play right what do you suppose would be the instructions if we wanted a computer to help pretend like we were playing on the computer so what things would be different how would we how would we describe that okay so yeah what's the first thing we would need to do so you would need to initialize your two players so you need to have two players and again you would have probably a variable called player1 and you would set that equal to zero right and you have a variable called player2 and you set that to zero because that would be their score okay and now you're the computer now if you're a person you're rolling for your first turn if you're a computer is the computer gonna go oh let me roll the dice no so you're gonna have to program it to do something because you don't want it to give you the same number every time right so what number would we be showing something between 1 and 6. okay number between 1 and six and how do you suppose we choose that number have you guys ever heard of a term called random numbers yeah so you could also just have it choose what a random number okay so the first step if you're the computer is to set the scores to zero the next thing we'll do is we will have it choose a number from one to six at random because that's going to be the role for that first player right and after it's rolled what does the computer need to do um tell the number and then whatever that number is add it to the player's score bar right so it's going to choose the number and it's going to show it here and then here it's going to take player one score right which is p1 and it's gonna it's gonna say the new score is whatever the old score was plus whatever this one was right we'll call it we'll call it roll and we'll put the one to show that it's player one right so we'll have the old score plus roll and that'll become the new score all right so now what do we do it's now the second player's turn now what do we do once it added it up okay so once we've got player ones now we have to do this again for player two player two so we'll choose another random number okay so we've rolled again for player two now what do we do um then you have the computer add the score to player two's score from zero to whatever they cleared two got randomly assigned okay and then repeat three so we have to repeat this whatever number of times we've decided that we're going to play in our program before we determine a winner and after we're done repeating that then what happens yes the player with the highest okay now how does the computer figure it out oh yeah whichever number is highest so you have to figure out which number is highest right so in this case uh subtract p1 oops you're saying subtract p1 minus p2 and if it's a negative number that means that this was bigger and p2 wins so if it's negative p2 wins if it's positive then this one was bigger so player one wins and if it's equal to zero then what happened um then it's a tie okay so what we're going to do now is i'm going to give you a real life dice race game to play you guys are gonna play the game together and when you're done playing the game you're gonna write the algorithm down for it
