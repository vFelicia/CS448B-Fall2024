my name is jakov i'm a senior machine learning engineering manager at spotify i teach machines how to understand humans natural language processing is used in almost all corners of spotify there are two things natural language processing and natural language understanding both of them involve using computers that we teach algorithms to extract information from language or to produce language we can look at what billions of other people have called playlists and titled their favorite sets of songs then extract relationships between words automatically and learn that when you say this you're looking for these kinds of songs just by analyzing the language other people have used to describe them the famous spotify recommendation algorithm right that powers a lot of our personalization experience is applying natural language processing algorithms to just the sequence of songs in a playlist we treat songs and playlists like words and sentences and we learn the language of music and musical expression and then we speak that language back to you when we personalize your listening experience by understanding the contents of the podcast and then searching within them we can really enhance your experience so that we're getting you the niche content that's perfect for you in the moment it's used to both enable the core experience and enhance it by making it personalized and much more contextual for our users so the natural language processing systems we built today they have billions of parameters they're incredibly complex but then you just set them up you feed them the data they train for a few days and then they just work in five to ten years i think everyone working in the software engineering field will be touching natural language processing in some way shape or form this is becoming the main modality of interaction to software and computer systems right it's a uniquely human trait language and so whenever you're working with natural language processing you're doing something that really touches the most human thing there is it often feels like you're working with magic you
