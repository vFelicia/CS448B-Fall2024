we're gonna break some new ground this morning so we have a twopart session for you first you will hear short pitches from some CS leaders on ideas to accelerate progress for Computer Science Education the movement and after that we'll celebrate some champions for K12 Computer Science Education so yesterday you heard a lot about the progress of the K12 computer science movement as someone who's been at code.org for 10 years I've been reflecting on this a lot lately I continue to be amazed that around each turn of the journey our community has taken and been on for this movement we've come together to do numerous things that many would have thought were impossible so reflect that as a community we've created hundreds of Champions at the highest levels of government industry and education with CEOs Governors even presidents writing lines of code with students and now we have 12 State Chiefs attending CS edcon we've prepared thousands of teachers with little to no background of in computer science that are now teaching hundreds of thousands of students we now have a global movement with numerous countries expanding instruction for computer science or policies to support our field and while there's much work that needs to do on this front we have greatly expanded access to and participation in computer science from underrepresented groups so my reflection on all this brings me back to where the K12 CS movement began you might think it started with government or nonprofits or the tech sector or policy makers or administrators where it really took off was with teachers I think about the story of Valerie Crawford she is a teacher here in Broward County and she started as an English language arts teacher in Middle School then she went to Summer professional development for our middle school computer science course the deal she had with her principal was that she would teach one section of computer science in five sections of ela by the time she started in the fall there was so much demand for computer science at our school that she was teaching five sections of ela I'm sorry computer science um I think she's a signing example of someone who now views computer science as her profession and not a side gig and she's not an exception in our field we've heard a lot about the topdown efforts for Computer Science Education from numerous CEOs or Governors or policy changes like graduation requirements it is exactly the right time for us to double down on these efforts because they will help expand instruction for Computer Science Education and we have helped build the capacity necessary to accelerate these movements but as we do these things as we're making this push the one idea I want to leave with you is Empower teachers to build the profession of Cs teaching cut teachers free to innovate in our field trust in them to bring the excitement and energy to K12 computer science from their students let's think differently about what the K12 computer science classroom can look like and what's the Cs teaching profession looks like here's some places I'll suggest as a start as the profession of computer science matures and the policy environment becomes more robust and deeper if you're a policy maker reflect on what we've done in other areas of education and the successes and mistakes and apply them to our field if you're a provider or somebody who's helping engage with teachers think about supporting teachers with more customization for tools in their classroom as they become more confident in teaching computer science think about modularity to enable flexible implementation to meet teachers where they are and where they will need to go in the future think about how empowering teachers can truly make CS a part of the core of our education system if you're an administrator think about how teachers can make computer science the one foundational piece of our system that we cannot do without so related to this idea progress on the idea of empowering teachers to build the profession of computer science has already started this summer the computer science Teachers Association one of the key Partners in our movement hosted 1700 teachers at their annual conference this was csta's largest conference ever and when they do virtual conferences they attract thousands of teachers Jake spoke yesterday about his excitement to welcome the world's largest computer science department and I think he's right to be excited I certainly am because the longterm success of accelerating the movement of Computer Science Education and continuing to make progress comes from truly empowering teachers to help build the world's largest education profession so thank you very much for a chance to share my thoughts with you and next up I'm going to introduce a old friend of mine an old colleague from Google who's a key partner of code.orgs and the Cs Community Karina box who's a head of Partnerships and ecosystems engagement lead for Google thanks Karina good morning everyone and thank you Cameron um all right so a thriving fair and vibrant future that we can all share in depends on young people having access to powerful learning opportunities and experiences since 2004 Google has invested over 240 million dollars to bring Computer Science Education access to students particularly students from underserved communities we've done this through a combination of our own products and programs like CS first code next cssi and Grasshopper And investments in Partners like code.org the computer science Teachers Association scratch and esep as we saw in the opening keynote yesterday there are now schools like digital Pioneers Academy where every student receives CS instruction progress has been made but we still have a long way to go before all students have equal access to CS I'd like to challenge the audience to imagine a future where all kids are learning CS no matter their zip code or identity in this world before us can students continue to only learn the basics like HTML or css is this inspiring I think not I want us to get radical about what's taught in CS classrooms what if we looked to the Technologies of the future to determine what we teach today where should we start my software developer colleagues would tell you see us students today should be learning how to program AI or build machine learning models as these tools will set the foundation for future products in fact Google CEO Sandra pichai said on a BBC podcast last year I expect AI to play a foundational role pretty much across every aspect of Our Lives be it Healthcare be it education we be it how we manufacture things or how we consume information and so I view it as a profound enabling technology today terms like Ai and ml may seem like buzzwords but Ai and ml are already being used to help improve products we interact with daily and it's important that our students understand how they work as well as how to create them take YouTube for example more than 500 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute machine learning helps us flag questionable content to reviewers this allows us to more quickly identify and remove spam or harmful content in the first quarter of this year more than 90 percent of the 3.8 million videos we removed were first flagged by an automated system making our platforms safer for users this would be impossible without machine learning another way we're using machine learning is in Google Translate Google Translate helps millions of people around the globe communicate with each other it listens to their speech and automatically translates it to another language the platform now supports over a hundred and thirty million or 130 languages sorry and it learns them through machine learning in fact the technology is so Advanced that it can learn new languages without ever seeing an example translation foreign to teaching the Next Generation learning how to use and build this technology is not enough we also have to teach students how to do so responsibly the development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve lives around the world from business to health care to education it's also raising new questions about how we build fairness interpretability privacy and security into these systems this is why Google has publicly shared seven AI principles and published a guide on responsible AI practices which include practices like be socially beneficial and avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias I encourage you to check them out so you may be thinking okay Karina this is a great aspiration but how can I get started today the great news is there are already courses available for you to use in classrooms at Google we have a foundational series of lessons called discover Ai and daily life which introduces students to artificial intelligence Concepts if your students are ready for something more advanced you can check out machine learning crash course which has 15 hours of interactive lessons and exercises and we're not just investing in our own programs we've also partnered with nonprofits like the AI education project to help them bring their nineweek curricula introduction to artificial intelligence to more school districts let's work together to build schools where all kids can be the computer build this computer science skills they need to chart their path in our everevolving world thank you uh next I'd like to welcome to the stage another uh key partner of code.orgs in the Cs Community General broadly Victor inoso who's Global Director of Education and philanthropy at Amazon thank you Cameron so CS for all is a universal goal we all share everyone here in this room shares Universal goals appeal to our pluralistic ideals of equality but the challenge of universal goals is that there are no Universal Solutions or to put a finer point on it there are no Equitable Universal Solutions Universal public education does not give us access to Universal high quality education Universal covid vaccines testing and relief do not protect us equitably almost every attempt at Universal Solutions consciously or unconsciously propagates privilege and more often than not widens inequality almost so what so what should we do if we want to Center equity in our drive towards a universal good John Powell and his team at the Berkeley Center for institute for othering and belonging have shown that the Equitable path to a universal good is through what they call targeted universalism we've adopted targeted universalism in our work at Amazon future engineer targeted universalism means setting Universal goals pursued by targeted strategies and processes these strategies are targeted based upon how different groups are situated within structures culture and across geographies so while we simplistically say that our Target population our young people from underserved and historically underrepresented communities we cannot use the same approach for each of those communities tailoring strategies for each Community can seem counterintuitive in an industry that is all about economies of scale so when we see in code.org's latest state of Cs report that only 20 percent of high schools on reservations offer any sort of foundational computer science coursework or when we see in the latest data that the number of college graduates in CS related fields that identify as native is a doubledigit number we know that what has Advanced Computer Science Education for these last 10 years is not serving indigenous communities we've spent much of this year working with our indigenous partner the one generation fund or one gen to craft a targeted solution to this overlooked problem from conversations with indigenous Educators and youth we know that technology can be Central to overcoming the challenges facing indigenous communities from language revitalization to Economic Development and that indigenous students like students everywhere want to learn computer science and their families are asking that it be taught we also know that any effort to support indigenous education has to come from indigenous communities and that's why we're excited to announce a 2.25 million dollar commitment from Amazon future engineer to support the launch of indigitized computer science a new initiative in partnership with one gen that will engage 10 000 indigenous youth in computer science over the next two and a half years in digitize will support indigenous schools and school districts to build and launch culturally responsive computer science curriculum it'll create Partnerships to teach CS online and out of school and will support early stage approaches to indigenous CS education to seed Innovation and build momentum we are inspired by the Brilliance of indigenous youth from Corey Ashley who's here in the audience who created an app that helps Navajo youth understand their kinship relationships to Danielle Boyer who invented an interactive and wearable educational robot that can speak to youth in their native language we are also going to be working with one gen to build a coalition of indigenous researchers and indigenousled research organizations like native pathways along with indigenous communities to conduct a culturally responsive study of the interest in an access to Computer Science Education among U.S Native American students there is precious little data in this area and so the results of this work will be invaluable we cannot wait to see what the next generation of indigenous youth create for their communities and for the world please join us thank you thank you Victor that was great uh next I'd like to uh welcome to stage and Andrea Russo whose field enablement lead for Microsoft Microsoft's been a key partner in the movement for computer science education for a number of years and for code.org welcome Andrea good morning everybody so I have to give a slightly cheesy computer science joke because you guys are my people and you'll get it so I'm a former classroom teacher and I had a struggling student and you know she was really working on this program and she asked one of her classmates hey can you give me your code because I'm really struggling and I need help and he's like no it's private and she's like but we're in the same class foreign I don't know um banana a more serious note you know we are currently in a changing world and today I'm here to talk to you about Microsoft's commitment to inclusive Computer Science Education so the reality is the world is changing we are continued to be confronted by Public Health crisis economic crisis social inequities and injustices and I'd be remiss if I don't mention the devastating impact on climate change that's happening on our communities rapid changes in technology is reshaping the way we live the way we work the way we learn and while technology is creating great opportunities and can solve society's biggest problems quite unfortunately it's also creating new challenges as well as new injustices within our communities it's critical that we apply Innovation and Technology while we are keeping the core values of education and inclusion embedded together we can reimagine a better future the fact is computer science is global we know that no person no community no individual can solve these problems alone and we need to face these complex challenges together and we need to Foster Partnerships and solutions that have lasting impact across these are our four connected areas within Corporate social responsibility at Microsoft that we're focused on my focus is really to think about how we can create Equitable Computer Science Education for all We Believe That Computer Science Education should be inclusive for every student regardless of their gender their class and their geography and the challenge that no one company can address is working across these sectors we need businesses we need educational institutions we need governments we need nonprofits and we need organizations to ensure everyone can participate in the digital economy we need to support communities such as in Juarez Mexico in New Orleans in New York City and Atlanta Georgia in rural Kentucky so that they can have access we need to think about how our partners like code.org like csta like the computer CS for all like reboot how we can accelerate each other's work and amplify each other's work because we really are stronger together finally we need to support lasting systematic change um such as the work we're seeing with the increase at 53 so exciting one of the programs we do this is through our signature project which is the teals program so technology education and literacy support build teacher capacity by pairing industry professionals with classroom teachers in this photo you're going to see two students and a volunteer this is in Detroit Michigan at Henry Ford Academy now we are working with over 500 schools 650 classes 1600 volunteers from over 700 different companies it really is collective action that we are working together on this issue now as we are wrapping up I know and I want to acknowledge that the last few years has had many many obstacles for all of us to overcome I want to express my deepest gratitude for all of the classroom teachers administrators School staff government Representatives nonprofits corporations and I'd say most importantly in this room computer science advocates to make computer science a reality for your students like we saw in Henry Ford Academy I hope that this wonderful experience throughout these last few days and again today is really going to open up communications for all of you um for those of you here in the United States uh the digital Equity act has created 2.5 billion dollars for infrastructure support I recommend looking into it there's uh connectivity there's devices there's training that's connected with those money um I would say let's put computer science education at the Forefront of digital Equity conversations and finally I would recommend that we broaden our reach of a CS Community engagements such as these recreate a robust ecosystem where we really can create um and Technology to help speak the common language together I know I'm over time but last two plugs um if you want to learn more about what Microsoft is doing please check out our corporate social responsibility page um you can fill out a contact form within our teals page come say hi to me my counterparts who are in the room Gustavo Kiki Adam from The make code team so thank you all so much for everything that you've done thank you to these great speakers for this morning now we're going to change gears a little bit uh and keeping with the communitybased theme for uh this morning we're going to recognize some champions of Computer Science Education so I'm going to Welcome to the stage Amber Davis who is not only a Floridian but director of our government Affairs at co.org so welcome up Amber foreign good morning everyone so happy to be here with you all today as Cameron said my name is Amber Mariano Davis director of state government Affairs here at code.org and on the advocacy team we are so excited to see the progress

honor International organizations with outstanding localization translation and proofreading efforts those receiving this award are edos Global program foreign on behalf of global Francesco lakia on behalf of programmer futuro and matcha sizwa of Nicolas Copernicus University in Toronto Poland foreign we wanted to take this special opportunity to recognize the Ministry of Education and science of Ukraine for undertaking the localization of computer science fundamentals into Ukrainian even during a time of War receiving this recognition is dimitro zagorodnia director general of the directorate of trans digital transformation we would also like to ask dimitro to share with us more information about the incredible work they're doing around rethinking education and ensuring children are still learning during a difficult time please join me in welcoming dimitro yeah thank you so much for this Applause and for having me here today um I came from Ukraine um and I'm very glad to be here today uh I would be short I would like to let's say first to tell a story then to share some insights from the story and then ask for help so the story will be around Ukraine about Ukraine I'm sorry we have a beautiful country who is the sea mountains big cities small towns and more importantly more than four million school children in the country and for previous two years uh when during my work in the Ministry of Education we have very ambitious goals in digital transformation in our government one of the most important goal was to grow up and to strengthen our Tech sector it is very important for the country and for the experts and other things and so on so among other things we have started to reform our education in the field of the computer science at all levels from drafting new curriculum for schools to making more publicprivate partnership in a higher education investing in in digital infrastructure making lots of tissue trainings so a lot of things happen and then in February Everything Has Changed Russians invaded our country simultaneously from nine different directions you can imagine that it was not about the computer science anymore for us so millions of ukrainians fled Ukraine they became refugees and all other countries Millions became internally displaced inside the country and while I was like searching for some images to show you how the country looks like if you Google Ukraine right now in the Google Images you will see like most of the pictures will be maps of invasion or something something like about the war but still the for now the vast territory suffered from occupation and unfortunately during the last 200 days more than two and a half thousand of different educational institutions have been damaged and more than 200 they are completely destroyed so for one and 1.5 million children for now in Ukraine the only option to learn is online and unfortunately I'm the one who is in charge of the of this yeah many schools have become temporary shelters in the western part of Ukraine so it is impossible also to learn there uh in in offline way but let's say five minutes is not enough for me to tell you even a small part of all the consequences and tragedies tragedies that we are facing but at the same time even in this Darkest Hours there are a lot of people I call them like people made from light or with bravery and dignity and each Ukrainian citizen have now some friends or acquaintance who can represent these qualities and values so even during the war we decided to start the school year and now are trying to do our best to educate children and provide support to people who need it so the inside I want to share with you is that there are two most important things that I have learned that can help you to succeed in any kind of Crisis two things are persistence and innovation we have made a decision not to stop our Transformations our reforms our projects but to accelerate them we have started to Pilot our new computer science curriculum in 50 schools say we decided during during the war choose these 50 schools and there have already started with the help of many partners we have introduced online courses from Coursera addicts udemy other platforms to our universities and allow universities to give credits for any courses they wish we are we have built new tools for electronic assessments like for instance we have this assessments done simultaneously in 31 country during summer because of a lot of refugees all around the world it was one of the biggest projects that I have been involved into in my life uh and we asked many companies to donate tablets laptops for our teachers and learners and I would like to say that the first track of with the thousands of Google Chromebooks is right now coming to our borders while we're sitting here so the whole process of the continuing transformation is also important for teachers and managers in the field they can see that we are we still care and that our goals for better education remain the same during last two months we have launched a project called it generation it is about a it is an opportunity to learn computer science for adults in more than 20 different private schools funded by the government in a partnership with 80 companies and for less than 2 000 scholarships that we have we received applications from more than 50 000 citizens in just two weeks during the war because like software engineering is is the major field and the expert opportunity and it is independent from Logistics or physical obstacles that we are facing right now so this is the computer science is also about the resilience in the nearest Future with the help of sales children and organization we are going to translate quote our courses to Ukrainian so you all have enemies and obstacles I I'm sure but in a similar time I think that all of them could be tackled with innovative ideas and persistence finally I would like you to believe me when I say that the sound of ways of the ocean and the opportunity to hear it here it's not something that is granted for free and there are people in the world risking their lives for their kids to have such an opportunity and they truly believe that it is in the hands of everyone to help to support with all devices books school buses to help a child from a refugee family or simply donate despite the war it is still our plan to build a learning ecosystem an environment where each child has an access to Quality education and the possibility to get relevant digital skills in in school or University or vocational education we already did a lot but there is more to go ahead and I hope that Learning Community worldwide will help us to issue these goals thank you very much
