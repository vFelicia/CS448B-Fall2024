hi i'm judy and i'm a software engineer at snap i make mistakes all the time actually at work me and my peers joke about it as long as we learn from it that's really the biggest lesson and we grow from it and able to improve ourselves be openminded be open to learning and exploring new things it can get frustrated at first but i think what really truly matters is that you're able to enjoy it love doing learning and that really what all it comes down to welcome to the theater we will use the theater to learn java while creating visuals animations and sound effects to use the theater we have to import a package that contains classes like the scene class we can also import a package that contains classes for various media components in our code we can instantiate a scene object and use it to draw shapes and images and play sounds in the theater we can use the draw image method to draw images at a given x and y location with a specified size we can also use the draw rectangle draw ellipse and draw line methods to create drawings the scene class also has methods to change the fill and stroke colors of these shapes the theater is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall but don't worry you don't have to remember that the scene class has methods get width and get height to give us this information when we need it we can also play sounds in the theater using the play sound and play note methods the play sound method lets us play a sound file and the play note method let us play individual notes if we call several methods to draw images or shapes we'll see the result as one image we can create animations using the pause method in the scene class with the pause method we can draw an image then pause for a given amount of time before drawing the next image or shape finally when we want to clear the stage we can use the clear method in the scene class there are other classes and methods that we can use to create some pretty cool drawings and animations that we'll learn about later theater is a space for you to use your imagination be creative and express yourself with art animation and sound all while learning java
