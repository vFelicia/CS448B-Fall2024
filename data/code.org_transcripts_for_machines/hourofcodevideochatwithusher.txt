hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for a special hour of code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week today we have Asher Raymond joining our question and answer session today Asher is a singer and songwriter who is passionate about leveling the playing field and giving you access to computer science education everyone let's take a minute to welcome Usher I hope you guys are all doing great today I see your posters and I appreciate you very much and I appreciate your attention and understanding me of the importance of this our code well we're gonna start with the first question unfortunately central city junior high school from Central City Iowa is having technical difficulties so I'm going to be asking the question for them uh sure how do you think programming has affected the world we live in you you with Myron with as advances modern technology is we still have some growth you uh nowadays it's about the opportunity the experience being brought directly to you nomads and also to the expansion of you understanding this world that is constantly evolving and connecting each and every day through computers through this social connection programming is going to become so significant in the future that we won't be able to do anything without a computer you know to have a job you'll have to not only understand how to navigate and understand you so we're having a bit of technical difficulty we're going to get in touch with Usher side and see if we can make the video a little bit more clear I'm we're gonna double check in a few minutes and we're going to continue with the next question just give us a couple of minutes to troubleshoot there's some technical difficulties that's causing us to not be connected so I'm gonna log out and log right back in you guys I'll be right back you and on the screamin went away yeah but we didn't you okay we're back can you guys see me yes okay cool sure the question was what do I think how do I think programming has affected the world that we live in well the way we communicate now is basically through the programming this communication this ability to have social media have us connected from all around the world and as we continue to grow you know it is this connection our computers our programming that will allow us not only to communicate but also understand each other in the future there will not be a world of of analog anymore everything is becoming all computer music the way music is created the way businesses are operated the way people communicate in terms of their businesses their jobs their identities all that that's the world will that's them that's the future how is computer science used in the music industry computer science is used in many different ways I mean we waited from a time when not before I actually started singing where everything was compute what everything was manually created through guitars there were some computer generation there was a smaller general earlier generation of computers there but for the most part now music is created in the studio on a laptop even though you're performing using instruments it goes into a computer and then reprocess is the way they eacute equalize turning upset bass or either treble the way we communicate in terms of get music out to the world being able to discover artists being able to see and make the connection to an artist through seeing what they visually have put together and what they've been able to do through code through introducing visuals videos music the musical experiences live experiences all of those things are now connected to computer science in that way DJs don't deejay without a laptop producers don't produce without a laptop Hey welcome to our third question from Asher Collier Elementary in Atlanta Georgia I love you guys how do you think computer coding will impact the way music is produced in the future well as I said I don't know if you guys heard me um my last answer but now producers don't create without a laptop they don't come they don't produce without a computer the connection to the way they introduce the music the way it's surfaced that on for instance you know sites like YouTube you guys familiar with YouTube you're familiar with Spotify all of these sources are now how music is distributed where you know earlier on before you went to a record store or a CD store or a music store you guys had to go to like a record store and get a record then it became a tape then it became a CD now it's a file and that file goes directly into your computer and now you don't even have to have a file anymore a zip drive or anything I think you just simply go online and you can purchase music right there from from the tap of a button and most likely not even purchase it now I mean so the distribution meaning the way that music is now given back and forth between people from the artists to the to the fan is through this connection and computer science and also to computer coding the creation of our videos the creation of how we are recognized as artists all will be created through code when you guys go to my website everything that you see there in terms of the information that I have to offer you whether you're buying a ticket to a concert or you you're getting information about where I'm gonna be what took place what photos were taken when I was there my communication between you know what you wrote and what I had to say in response all done through coding all done through computer coding thank you we're gonna go to the next question and from Memorial Middle School in Spotswood New Jersey oh my god I I love you what is your opinion of what is your opinion about people using technology to illegally download music and how do you feel about platforms that offer unlimited access to music like Spotify well first of all I want to send a shout out to the man in the back of the room with this camera filming want to put you on the spot all right well you know downloading music was inevitable it was something that was going to happen regardless because people want the connection you know and then there still are people who care about the creation or the creative problem process for the artist the art work that goes into it all of those things are for people who really do care about understanding the artist and what they are attempting to convey through their music so there will still be people who'll go to this tool to you know Amazon in order but to look at it now you're making the connection to Amazon to even get the actual form of a tangible copy of a CD or a record if there's anyone that still produces a physical copy of a record um but it was inevitable that sites like Spotify or Napster earlier which was one of the first ones to make the connection where people will be able to download music and in time it will become free because people would naturally then reupload it you know I think that now people have to be a lot more savvy and now it's gonna be more important to understanding understand coding especially if you want to have some sense of individuality because you don't have a tangible copy anymore so now you have to have a knowledge and understanding right of how to create through coding what your creative intern rotation of your album was so that people can now have it otherwise they're gonna get the music for free they're gonna like the songs that they like they may buy an entire album or they might not but at least you are able to make the connection to your fans to hopefully lead to live performances and being able to make the connection there but you know that's that's my opinion I don't I don't I don't have any issue with any illegal downloading I don't like it I would hope I hope that you guys would go and support me and buy my albums did you buy my album last time you came out No oh wow well hopefully next year when I put out my next time you guys will purchase it and you won't illegally download it but I hope that you like it regardless thank you I'm going to Garcia Young Men's Leadership Academy in Austin Texas gentlemen I am music is talented and you're very talented you just want to know how do you feel about audience I'll tune for the muta stuff you can this is a silent answer no um I'm not too happy um the abuse of autotune but you know when it's used as a tool to heighten what your experience is in through the music right it's okay but for people who don't go through the process I'm nurturing your voice this is a godgiven talent right so I had to work at it really really hard but when it's used as a tool to perfect your voice without you doing the work I mean in the long run eventually people are gonna know that you're not a real singer and that you can't really hold it together in front of an audience which is a which is what this is ultimately about it's a connection between the artist and the audience and being able to interpret emotion filling and convey passion through song and melody the disconnect is autotuned at times because you may you lose some of the texture you don't get all of the emotion because it's kind of muffled together for perfection and those little bitty things that are being taken out in my opinion are the things that make who we are as art is so unique so you know I don't have an issue with it as I said but I do feel like it disconnects people from the emotional connection and the actual skill of being a great singer thank you we'll move on to our next question from Southwest middle school in Gastonia North Carolina if you could create an application to make your life easier okay if I could create an application to make my life easier what would it be and why is that what you asked is that your question yes okay have you seen the movie heard okay you should see it it's pretty cool I would actually um create an app that would be like her and you know she would make my life super easy organize all of my computers organize my life through my computer and help me manage my daytoday also to be a cool companion to talk to thank you now we're gonna go to Columbus middle school from Columbus my question for you is what inspired you going to music and what I fight you are aspiring for don't use autotune um well hmm what inspired me to go into music is my love and passion for it what advice do I have for aspiring singers you have to work at this as time is leading us more and more towards code and computer science being more relevant than anything we cannot lose the sense of individuality and get lost so while it's great to have tools like Toto I like Pro Tools and it's great to have autotune and all those things you should still have to remember that the most important part is the asset that is you so your ability to listen to the music and physically sing it and sound great or either feel good is important you know as the standard is changing of how we communicate and how we offer what we have to what we have is artists you have to continue to nurture the true talent that means you got to work at whatever you want to do you know I think that being physical is important understanding how to distribute it how to connect how to continue to live your life and make sure that you're not behind that's the importance of the this hour of code but as an artist you cannot lose the true sense of art of the art of making music in the art of performing that's the most those are the two most significant things that were taught to me when I first started when there were when there were no computers and the thing that I think every person who is aspiring to be an artist needs to understand that should be a priority you're welcome finally our last question from Milton Elementary School in Milton Delaware well one to be passionate about whatever you invest your time in because anything that you are successful that you're gonna have to work at okay the other side is making sure that you understand the importance of computer coding and also to to live in a world where computers are going to be relevant and we're gonna need them for everything so if you don't understand the importance of the net you'll be behind you may not be able to have a job you may not be able to take care of yourself you may not be able to communicate you may lose your connection and not be able to find out what's going on in the world without this device without understanding the importance this one component that right there I think is what is essential for you to learn and also to what is essential for you to to be a great student and also to make sure that greater than that you grow up to be an incredible parent an incredible adult and understand how to communicate and that's that's it well thank you that wraps up our questions so thank you guys for joining us today and spending time answering them yeah so much for the students nope but everyone let's to join me in the round of applause thinking usher for his time joining us today to support
