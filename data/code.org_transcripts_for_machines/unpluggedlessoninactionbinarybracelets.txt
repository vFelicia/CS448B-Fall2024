okay how many of you have heard of binary a couple of you when you're dealing with computers you're dealing with electricity and most specifically it's usually on and off and actually everything you do in a computer can be represented as on or off so you can show information using combinations of on or off or up and down or left and right pretty much any combination of two opposites and when you have these two opposites we call that language binary binary perfect so for every space you can have two options in that space we already talked about having either a zero or a one one right why don't we use on as just a clear box and off would be a dark box in our activity today we're going to say that a dark box means everything is off like all the lights are off in the house dark box means and a empty box or a white box means fun so what we're gonna do next is i'm gonna hand out these worksheets and do you know what they actually are these are yep they're binary codes which means this is how you would represent or show a letter if you were on the inside of a computer all right so i'm going to hand these out real quick so that you can all see the code the decoder key but i'm not going to have you do anything with them yet so right now i'm gonna put a letter on the board how many of these spaces they're called digits they're actually called binary digits which we squish down to the word bit how many of these bits do we need to make up one letter eight yes five how many are on the board eight eight very good so we need eight bits to make a letter and we call that we call that grouping of eight bits a bite how many of you have heard that term a bite yep it's what makes up a gigabyte or a kilobyte or a terabyte or whatever you happen to be using right there's a secret kind of funny name for half of a bite what do you think half of a bite is called i saw your hand first do you have a guess how about you a millibyte no there there is such thing as millibate but half a bite is called a nibble a nibble isn't that what you call it when you take half a bite some people spell it like this so that it's the same as bite but that's what it's called i'm not even kidding you all right so i want you to use your super secret decoder key and i want you to look up and see if you can figure out what the letter is all right you ready on the count of three one two three okay good okay so this was a k so now we all have our binary bracelets we're going to fill them in to look like the first letter of our first name and then you're going to color your bracelet to look like this so you'll color don't color color color color don't color color color and then you'll color don't color don't color color so color don't color don't color color and then you're gonna store your initial on a bracelet some kids will find it really hard to understand at first what we're doing with the decoding and you'll hear a lot of i don't get it or i don't understand it's okay if even about half the class is like that until you're done with all the examples just do some examples on your own have them figure some out that you write up and then finish off with the classroom coming up with one for you by that time they're usually all on board there's a big temptation in this lesson to over teach and go into binary and what binary numbers are and how they equate but you really don't have to talk about that decimal equivalent or any of that this is purely to give your students an idea how computers store and transmit information so they have a better idea why we do all this stuff so efficiently in the first place all right so what did we learn yes so we learned binary and we learned how to encode letters using binary right so now we know how to store entire letters using only offs and ons so what you guys have done is you have made a storage device and you are storing letters to your wrist right now yep so you're a computer
