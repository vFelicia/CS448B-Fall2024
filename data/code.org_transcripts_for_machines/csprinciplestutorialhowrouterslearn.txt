in this activity you and your classmates will be acting as routers in a connected network of eight routers but you'll only have direct paths to three of those seven other routers so in the activity you can only speak to those three other people you'll have a series of conversations with the three routers you are connected to to exchange information about paths to other routers in the network these conversations are simulating how real routers learn about paths to other routers in the network that they are not directly connected to often it's easier to understand an activity by seeing a demo rather than reading about it and you're about to see a set of two conversations one between routers c and f and then a conversation between c and d hey i'm router f i'm router c uh and since you're f i'm going to be filling out the third column of my sheet to see your best paths to the other routers in the network do you have any connections to router a i do not yet have any connections to router a neither do i what about router b i have a connection of 10 to router b okay i'm going to write that down so it cost me 2 to get to you and it cost you 10 to get to b so it cost me 12 to get to b going through you um you are router c so i know how to get to you what about router d do you have a connection i do my shortest connection is five that means i can get to d with a cost of seven what about router e do you have a pack i have no paths to e yet okay i do with a cost of one okay so i can get to e through f with a cost of one it takes me two to get to u plus the one it takes u to get to e so that's three to get to e through u perfect i'm router f and i know how to get to myself but what about router g do you have a path i do not have a path to g okay i have a path to g with a cost of eight okay so it takes me two to get to you plus eight then for you to get to g so that's two plus eight is ten to get to g perfect what about router h i have no paths to h me either okay okay so your writer c i'm router c d okay uh do you have a path to a i still do not have a path to a okay well i can get there at a cost of four okay so through d it cost me five to get to u and then costs u four so five plus four is nine so now it takes me nine to get to a through u do you have a path to b i do it's a cost of ten okay so it cost me 5 to get to you plus 10 is 15. i also have a path to b and it cost me 6. okay so it takes me 5 to get to u 6 it takes so that's 11. so that's not my cheapest but i do have it right through you now okay um u r c so i know how to get to u and i am d and you know how to get to me what about e i have a route through to e of a cost of three three okay so five plus three is eight uh that is cheaper than my current one i can get there at a cost of ten okay so it takes me five to get to you it takes you 10. so through you i could get to e with a cost of 15 but that's not cheaper than my current one do you have a path to f i do it's a cost of two five plus two is seven for me uh what about a path to g i have a path to g it's a cost of ten then do you have a path to h i have no path to h all right i can get to h at a cost of 12. okay so costs u 12 and takes me 5 to get to u so 17 to get to h remember that in the activity you can only talk to your three connected routers but you may find that if you go back to a router a second time they'll have new information about a shortest path that they've learned about have fun
