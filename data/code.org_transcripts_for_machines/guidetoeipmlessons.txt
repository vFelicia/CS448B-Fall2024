many of code.org programming units are taught using four lesson types explore investigate practice and make we call this model eipm and right now we're going to take a look at each of these lesson types to give you a better understanding of what they look like individually and how they work together hey class today we are gonna be each explore lesson is teacherled handson and has an activity that typically uses manipulatives to introduce students to a programming concept all right class today we are going to be doing three things we are going to be reading code in investigate lessons the teacher leads the class through a set of activities where students recode in a working app discuss the code with their classmates and make small modifications to existing code in practice lessons students work individually or in paris on a set of programming tasks that require them to write as well as debug code finally in make lessons students create an app for which they are given screen elements but little to no starter code a programming unit will have two or three of these eipm sequences one for each major concept at the end of the unit students complete a project that challenges them to independently and creatively apply what they've learned this video series is designed to help you understand each part of the eipm model in detail you'll learn how the role of the teacher shifts from one lesson to the next and you'll have an opportunity to see examples of what these different teaching strategies look like in practice we even have tips about how you can prepare before teaching this lesson there are two important things to remember first look for connections eipm lessons are designed to work together keep an eye out for how the different lessons build on one another second expect to practice this series gives you an introduction to eipm but you'll need to practice it in your own classroom as time goes on you'll grow more comfortable using it and be able to make modifications to meet your students needs now let's dig in and see what eipm is all about
