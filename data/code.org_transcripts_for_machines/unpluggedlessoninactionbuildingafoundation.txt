one of the really important things in computer science is that there are still a lot of problems that no one has solved yet so like in school you know when you're adding 2 plus three right people have done that before right so how thrilling is that do you feel like you're an Explorer and you're an innovator and you've discovered something new no but the truth is that when you're exploring and you're innovating things get really really hard sometimes because sometimes you come to a place where there are problems and there is nobody that knows how to solve them and you have to try and figure it out all by yourself so what happens if you get to a problem that no one has solved yet and you just go oh darn it no one solved this guess I'm done will you ever really invent anything no no will you ever really create something brand new no no you'll explore things and sometimes you'll explore things and you don't know what they do and to keep yourself safe you have to know what steps you need to take to explore something right yeah so that's what this lesson is going to be all about it's going to be all about creating something new and knowing that there are going to be times when there you don't know something and I know you don't know it and I know it's going to be hard but you guys are going to have to keep working and try and figure it out so what what are the things that you worry about if we are doing something and you don't know how to do it what are some of the things you'll worry about um if I'm doing a timed multiplication test so I'm worried that I won't finish it in time so if you don't know something very well you might worry that you won't finish it in time or that you won't be fast enough so how do you think you would feel if you're working on a project and you're working on a project and it didn't work so you try again and you try again and it still doesn't work and then you try again and you try some more and it still doesn't work how are you going to feel a little bit bad a little bit bad worried worried um distressed distressed you might feel in distress frustrated frustrated that's a really good word these are all really good words to describe the feelings that we have when we're trying something new but you know what's really important is if we understand that we're going to have those feelings and we understand that everybody is going to feel something kind of like that then it gives us permission to say well I know I feel like this but I'm going to keep working anyway and so if you've been not getting it and not getting it and you're frustrated and you're stressed and you're in distress and then you get it and it works and then you feel amazing and wonderful and happy and you know and Panda and you need those feelings of of oh no I'm afraid before you break through to those feelings of yay this was amazing and so now every time you feel oh this is scary oh I feel bad about myself oh I feel distress I want you to tell yourself in your head that means that when I persevere and I figure it out I'm going to feel excited happy right really that's really really good so that's what this lesson is all about I'm going to give you a challenge and it's going to be hard I'm not going to lie to you as hard as pandom it's supposed to be hard it's supposed to be challenging with a team and it it you'll you can work you'll work in a team but you'll all be building your own structures okay and you're supposed to feel a little bit of frustration because it won't work right away and that's okay I want you to keep working until you get it and you guys are going to go Miss Kiki Miss Kiki can I have some help and I'm going to say nope and you're gonna say Miss Kiki Miss Kiki I don't know how to do this and I'm going to say I know and you're going to think Miss Kiki is really mean sometimes but then when you guys get your thing to work and you did it all by yourself you won't think Miss Kiki is mean anymore then you'll understand what I was trying to do okay okay you each get your own supplies all right don't eat them you need to make a structure that is at least as tall as the cup and it has to be strong enough to hold this book what are you kidding I'm not kidding you kidding and you can only use the tools that are inside the cup so you don't get any more if you break them or eat them then you're making it even harder for yourself teachers have said that if you get spice drops instead of the fruit flavored gumdrops the kids are much less likely to eat the supply this lesson is difficult for the students but it's supposed to be difficult for the students once you tell them that you're not going to interfere with their lesson don't interfere with their lesson it's really important this activity really will change the thinking of your classroom and you'll find that when you refer back to it kids are more likely to persevere just a little bit longer in almost anything
