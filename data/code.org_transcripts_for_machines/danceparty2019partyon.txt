Congratulations! You've just learned the basics of computer science. Now you can use these blocks to create a dance party of your own design, to share with your friends. If you look in the toolbox, you'll find some brand new blocks you haven't seen before. For instance, you can use the Layout block to arrange dancers in different ways on the screen. Have a look around, and try experimenting with these new blocks and features. Will you create a carefully choreographed dance to your favorite song? or a danceoff with your friends? Or something else altogether? At the end of the tutorial, you can share a link to your creation with your friends. Stretch your imagination and just have fun!
