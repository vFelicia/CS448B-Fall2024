This is a repeat block. The code inside a repeat block will repeat, or "loop" as many times as you'd like. In puzzles with loops, code that looks like this, works exactly the same as code like this. When you see the same blocks repeated over and over many times in a row, like this, that's a clue that you could make your code shorter by moving the repeated section into a repeat block. Now let's give it a try!
