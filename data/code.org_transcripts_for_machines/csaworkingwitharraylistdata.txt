imagine i'm a teacher who needs to enter grades from an exam my students took i'm not sure how many i need to enter so i'll create one arraylist to store the students names and another to store their grades i'm entering the grades in alphabetical order by the students names for aisha freili celeste etc the arraylist class has methods for adding and changing values in a list there are two ways to add to an arraylist the first way adds an item to the end of the list we'll add aisha's grade by saying the name of the arraylist dot add we pass the value we want to add as its argument now let's add celeste grade we forgot to add braley's grade we can use the other version of the add method to add an item at a specific location we want to add briley's grade at index 1 before celeste grade to do this we say the name of the arraylist dot add we pass the index where we want to add the item and the value to add at that location as its arguments to make sure we entered the grades correctly we can loop through the list just like a 1d array when we loop a 1d array we use the length of the array in the condition of our for loop with an arraylist we need to use the size method to get the number of items in the arraylist in the body of the for loop we use the get method to get a value from a list just like a 1d array we want to specify the index we want to retrieve from the list inside the print statement we can say names.get and use the loop control variable index as the argument to get the students names we can do the same to print the grades oops we forgot to give braley the extra credit points they earned for coming after school for tutoring to change a value in a list we use the set method so we can say grades.set that specify the index we want to change and the new value with these methods we can easily add change and retrieve items from an array list
