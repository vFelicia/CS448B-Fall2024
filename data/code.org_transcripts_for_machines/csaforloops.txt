let's explore how four loops help us save time repeating actions for loops are a specific type of loop that repeats a code segment a given number of times let's imagine we're programming a robot to put books on a shelf one at a time each shelf can only hold four books we want the robot to repeat the action of placing a single book on the shelf four times the header of a for loop contains all of the necessary information to set up and run the loop a set number of times four loop headers have three distinct parts a control variable a condition to decide when to stop the loop and how the control variable is changed for the control variable we create a variable called book and set it to a starting number next the condition the loop will continue as long as this condition is true in this case we will loop as long as book is less than or equal to four as soon as book reaches five the condition reevaluates as false and the loop ends lastly we change the loop control variable so that the condition eventually becomes false for example increasing book by one on the first pass through the for loop book equals one on the second pass book equals two then book equals three and so on with loops we can access a specific element in an array using the loop control variable as the index for example if we put the robot's books into an array like this string robots books cs is awesome java is cool adventures in java lab my life as a software engineer then we can print this array using the loop control variable to start at the first book at index 0 and loop through the array until we get to the end like so let's get the names of the books that are in the robots books array we can do this by adding this statement inside of the loop now on each pass through the for loop the current book at position index is printed to the console we can use for loops to access and modify elements in an array the basic setup remains the same no matter what code we are running
