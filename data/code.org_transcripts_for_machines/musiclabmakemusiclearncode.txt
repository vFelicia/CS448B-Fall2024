music lab it's really cool you can like make your own music with it I just really love code and music it's like you're almost quoting without even knowing it's helped me engage just another whole set as student this is cool I don't think there's ever been a better time to be a Creator whether that's in any field of computer science or music like I do there are an abundant amount of tools that can allow you to create things that just didn't exist before there are tons of plugins that I can just on my laptop and create the type of music that I really am drawn to I can make almost anything that I can imagine and with the help of a computer bring it to the world I wouldn't be able to create music without technology I started making everything in the Box meaning on my laptop a lot of our biggest songs are just made there we've been able to manipulate the stuff in the Box to sound like something that's acoustic or organic or actual piece of Hardware I feel like music is a way to express things that you just can't with words or physical actions the first song I wrote was about my friend who was leaving town and I was so sad for some reason wrote a song and uh I discovered that it just helps me cope with stuff I think it's important to have access to the tools that can allow you to express yourself code.org and music lab is one of those tools where if you're feeling something and you just want to get it out you can use a pencil and paper but you can also create something that's much more robust and share it in a way that you wouldn't have been able to before I was like a student who got an opportunity to get a laptop to get my music production softwares and start making music it was basically the start of my career I started making demos I'd encourage everyone to experience with some form of computer science whether it's music or anything else to create things that are important to you that don't exist a
