when you put a loop inside of another loop we call that a nested Loop for example here we're given the code all to draw one triangle with sides of length 100 pixels using the repeat times block set to three once for each side of a triangle but we want to draw six triangles in order to do that we're going to take that Loop and place it inside of another repeat times block pretty cool
