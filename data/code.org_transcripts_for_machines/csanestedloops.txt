my name is pan and i am a software engineer at xbox there's always multiple ways to tackle a problem and i think part of what we do in learning more is learning just how to tackle those problems more efficiently by using what other people have figured out before us but also we can maybe we'll come up with something better we don't know give it time let's say we are building a brick wall we start by laying a single book laying one book at a time is this type of loop if we repeat this action five times we get a row of books laying a row of books can also be a loop the placing of each individual book is an inner loop and the placing of an entire row of books is an outer loop after the outer loop executes five times we have a brick wall this is an example of a nested loop a nested loop is a loop that exists inside the body of another loop let's see how this would look using for loops let's start with the outer loop our wall needs to have five rows of books we write the outer loop just don't have one and stop when we complete the fifth row then we will increase those by one for each row of the wall we need to lay five books revise the inner loop just stir that one and stop when we have made the fifth brick we will increase brick by one inside the body of the loop we can add a print statement to tell us what row we are on and how many books we have made in that row so far when we run this code we see each book displayed for the first row then we go to the next row and we see each book displayed for the second row and so forth until we complete the fifth row nested loops are good for performing repetitive actions like when robots work on an assembly line
