hi my name is gabrielle beans and i'm a research scientist turned science educator my field of research was in studying population genetics of penguins by looking at dna from living penguins as well as from their seven thousand year old bones but today i'll be introducing agentbased modeling of complex adaptive systems and there are many different ways to model natural phenomena or manmade systems each type of modeling is appropriate in different circumstances and we're going to focus today on one type of modeling known as agentbased modeling in agentbased modeling you create the model by describing the agents giving them rules to follow and then letting them interact with each other and their environment the model can then be used to run experiments that could help us understand the real world for example you could create an agentbased model of an ecosystem by creating some predator agents and some prey agents and then you could see the resulting population dynamics as the predator and prey interact another thing you could do would be to create an agentbased model of an epidemic by making many date many different agents to represent a population and see how a disease might spread through the population by having healthy agents become sick after touching a sick agent it seems pretty simple but agentbased models can actually be very sophisticated and can be used to model and understand complex adaptive systems just by giving agents simple rules to follow to make agentbased computer modeling easy for beginners we will use a computer modeling and simulation tool that helps with creating agents and giving them rules to follow this way you don't need advanced mathematics to work with interesting and powerful models so let me walk you through the thought process we use when planning a model there are certain questions that can help us with to guide our design of agentbased models i'll share these questions with you as well as an example of how we answer them so the questions are in the first place what is the scientific question you're interested in question number two what is the phenomenon system or process that you need to model to answer this question what are the features of interest to model and how will you capture data on these features who or what are the agents how do the agents behave and interact with each other or the environment how will you build and test your model and then how will you use that model to run experiments that help you answer your original question so say we were interested in modeling an underwater ecosystem with fish kelp and sharks in our example we've answered the questions like this so question one what is the scientific question you're interested in the answer would be how does an ecosystem with predators and prey remain stable second question was what is the system or process we want to model and in this case it would be an underwater ecosystem with fish kelp and sharks what are the features of interest of the model well we hypothesize a certain parameters such as how fast the fish sharks and kelp reproduce as well as how much energy the fish gets from eating kelp and the sharks get from eating fish will affect each species longevity in the ecosystem it would also be important to track the numbers of fish kelp and sharks over time so how will the model visualize these features by using different shapes for each agent and who are what are the agents well the agents are the three species making up the ecosystem fish kelp and sharks and how do the agents behave and interact with each other or with the environment all of the agents move around randomly when a fish agent encounters a kelp agent it eats it the kelp disappears and the fish gains energy when the shark eats the fish it also gains energy the fish and the shark reproduce when they have the right amount of energy and the kelp reproduces at a rate independent of energy another question was how will you build and test the model and so how we're going to do that is by using an agentbased modeling program to build the model afterwards we'll run experiments collect data for example by changing how often the different species can reproduce or by changing any other variable that we're interested in and what can we learn from this model so in this particular model we could gain an understanding of how delicate the equilibrium of an ecosystem is by seeing how easily one species can take over and the others go extinct agentbased modeling has been successfully used by teachers and students to model and study complex adaptive systems we really hope you'll enjoy creating agentbased models too it'll not only help you understand systems in a different light but you might be surprised just how much fun it can be
