foreign CEO and cofounder of Runway a company creating AI tools for video generation and storytelling one of our most recent AI tools is an algorithm called gen 2. it allows you to turn texts just language into video I'm Mira murati I'm the chief technology officer at open AI the company that created chat GPT computers were first invented to do math and solve hard problems and despite all the advances in computer science most people assume that computers can never have creativity and Imagination but is that still true AI systems can not only write stories they can create images that no one has ever seen before AI is able to create awardwinning art like this it can create social media influencers that don't exist in real life and even create complete video sequences just a few words of instruction but how does this AI work and does it have true creativity and Imagination let's dig in early projects that taught AI to create art used something called a generative adversarial neural network which is a way of using 2A models to generate images the way this works is that one Ai call a generator trying to create images that are similar to the ones in the training set a different adversarial AI trains to the attack if those images are close to the originals or not both AIS train against each other until the adversarial can no longer detect what image is real and what image was created artificially at this point the generative AI has learned to generate real looking imagery now this is great but computer scientists have come up with something even better called diffusion inspired by physics diffusion involves converting an image to an unrecognizable blur or noise and training an AI to reverse this process take for example this image with all of its detail we can introduce a little bit of Randomness or noise to these pixels which takes away some of the detail if you repeat this gradually one thousand times the image loses all details and becomes Pure Noise now every step of this gradual transition is an opportunity to train AI to learn to reverse the process an AI neural network can train by looking at a noisy image and then try to generate the slightly less noisy version because the noisy version of the image doesn't have all the details the AI is learning to guess what the higher resolution details should be and that's how it creates new images now to train an AI we repeat this with millions and millions of images each of them labeled with their descriptions if we do this enough times bi learns to take a text description and generate completely new images nobody has ever seen before or to alter existing images the same approach can also be used for videos now this raises multiple questions is the AI really learning creativity and Imagination on the one hand if you look at art and video created by AI it can be beautiful original and amazing on the other hand the AI only learns this by doing math at the pixel level while studying creations made by people is that really creativity another question is the issue of copyright AI learns by studying the creations of others and the original creators may want to say in this of course when humans learn to create they also study creations made by others so the legal questions here are not simple we're still in the very early days of teaching AI how to create new types of media today AI can generate photos and videos soon you would also learn to create music and 3D worlds this will have an incredible impact on all aspects of society especially in entertainment not just movies and music but also games we hope you learn more about how AI works and how to use it for your own creations what will you create
