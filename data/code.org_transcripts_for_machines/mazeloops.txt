One thing that computers are really good at is repeating commands. As a person, you'd get really bored if you had to do the same thing lots of times in a row. But a computer can do the same thing millions or even billions of times and not get bored, and be able to carry that out really well. For example, if I wanted to wish everyone on Facebook a Happy Birthday by sending them an email, it might take me more than a century to actually write out all of those emails to everyone. But with just a few lines of code I can have a system send an email to everyone on Facebook wishing them a Happy Birthday. So that's what loops are and why they're valuable, and something that computers can do very well. To get the bird to the pig in this level... rather than drag three North blocks on to the workspace, you will use the "repeat" block. Drag the "repeat" block on to the workspace and enter the number 3. Then drag the "move North" block into the "repeat" block and hit "Run" to see if you got it right. Congratulations, you got it!
