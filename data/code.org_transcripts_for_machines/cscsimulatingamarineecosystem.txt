my name is Ali Chase and I am an oceanographer at the University of Washington I study microscopic plankton in the water near the ocean surface part of my job is to study how well the ocean's ecosystem is balanced which means measuring different organisms in the food chain let's look at this basic model of a marine life ecosystem we have Coral algae and fish the fish eat the algae and the right amount of algae keep the coral healthy Coral protects our coastlines and is a home for fish in today's lesson you'll create a computer simulation of a simple marine life ecosystem at risk of overfishing by humans overfishing occurs when fish are caught faster than they can reproduce if there aren't enough fish then the algae take over if the algae take over then the coral dies if the coral dies then the fish don't have a home and our coastlines are at risk of Destruction this is a cause and effect relationship but there's good news we can practice sustainable fishing practices sustainability is our ability to keep the balance of our natural environment and protect it from harm in this case not taking too many fish at one time over the next few lessons you'll learn how to create a model of a simple marine life ecosystem with code this model will allow you to change different parameters like how many fish you start with or when the fishing boat comes you can change this model to observe different simulations of this ecosystem once you have a working model you can problem solve to find ways humans can practice sustainable fishing to keep our oceans healthy for the future with code you can observe natural phenomena without leaving your computer although I do hope you visit an aquarium to observe sea creatures in real life too foreign foreign
