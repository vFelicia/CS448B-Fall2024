as you can see i've already added the blocks in the workspace to get the b to move forward move forward turn right and move forward to the first cloud now we need to figure out how to see if there's a flower underneath the cloud and if there is get nectar that's what we're going to use this if block for you can see that this says if at flower do whatever is inside so what do we need to put inside that's right get nectar if you're at a flower you'll get nectar if you're not at a flower you won't run what's inside of this block next we need to move forward and do it again if there's a flower underneath that cloud get nectar as you can see my code is a little bit too long so i'll leave it up to you to figure out how to make it shorter happy coding
