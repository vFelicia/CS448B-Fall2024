my my good sorry we're muted we're M thank you Kendall for telling us that um we will not repeat and start at the beginning again thank you all right GNA rewind try that again AL righty all right I'm c i coordinate our hour of code campaign code.org I'm Tanya Parker I am a product manager and engineer here at cator hi I'm Alice I run our product and marketing teams here at code.org all right well thank you so much everybody thank you especially the people who gave us a heads up we were muted we're excited to jump back in um our quick agenda as we're going to go over what to do before your hour of code what to do in the classroom um and then we can do a bit of questions and answers you guys have already found the Q&A part and then the other app you might want to look at is our showcase that's where we are showing links that might be helpful for you so hopefully everyone on this webinar has already been contacted by a teacher and you've already started coordinating Alice is going to go over a few tips if you haven't yet been contacted but you still want to volunteer okay so we know some of you guys have not been contacted um it's a tough one because a lot of our volunteers tend to be in Tech regions like Seattle or San Francisco um whereas I was just talking to a teacher yesterday in rural Georgia who has not managed to find a volunteer yet for her classroom and so we're encouraging those teachers that are spread out all over the world to reach out remotely because you know where the teachers are is not necessarily where the volunteers are um if you are in a remote place and um some of the teachers have said they've reached out but they volunteer was already volunteering in another classroom if you can volunteer in more than one classroom I know the teachers would appreciate it if you are in a tech Hub and you haven't been reached um two things you can do one is um please uh you know just hang on we're trying to encourage the teachers to reach out doing remote uh chats they may or may not want to do that um thank you for volunteering we really appreciate it if you don't get contacted now um we'll be in contact with you maybe you can volunteer for hour of code next year um we'll also ask you if you're interested in other opportunities and we'll see if there's other ways you can help a school um the other thing you can do is you can proactively reach out to a school uh we can't list for privacy reasons all of the school addresses that are doing hour of code on our website but if you just reach out to your local school oftentimes they will be doing the hour of code and they would love your help or um maybe they're not doing the hour of code and you reaching out to them will you can help them figure out how to do the hour of code and do it with a classroom I've done you know in my experience I personally have reached out to a bunch of schools classrooms and they've always been excited about the idea of of having somebody come in and do an hour of code with the classroom so um I'd recommend you just try reaching out to a local school but thank you again for volunteering if you have not been contacted all right so thank you so much Alice for kind of going watch if you haven't been contacted if you're already in contact with your school we want to review kind of the step you need to make sure you've taken care of before you show up next week so first and foremost it's really important that you've identified with your teacher a day and a time you can you can go to her class um be sure to give yourself a little bit of time to show up before you'll need to sign in at the front office even before you get to the classroom every school's most likely going to have you fill out some sort of form before you arrive for outside volunteers if you haven't done that already it's really important that you contact your teacher today to make sure you filled out all the paperwork so you can show up without a hitch next week um be sure you've talked to your teacher about kind of what he or she is expecting when you're in the classroom um this volunteer program is first and foremost an opportunity for you to show students what all of the opportunities are with computer science and so it's much more of an inspirational and a mentorship opportunity than necessarily providing technical help in the classroom so we want to make sure that expectation is clear with teachers as well and then finally this weekend is your chance to try the hour of code tutorials so we've got a awesome brand new tutorials for students who can read our Minecraft and Star Wars tutorials have been a hit we're already seeing students who've tried them and teachers who've tried them loving it um if you're working with prereaders um the foods is another great opportunity and all of our tutorials are listed at code.org learn so please do check it out so that you're not totally um lost in the woods when you show up next week the last thing we've linked to in our showcase bar is um kind of a list of tips that we another one of our partners has put together this is an awesome document you can review to think about what you want to do in your classroom um it's kind of a sample agenda some things they suggest when you show up are talking about um both what you do professionally and how computer science interacts with your daytoday but also what you're doing outside of work to kind of showcase that you know people who are doing computer science are doing all sorts of things beyond computer science as well Kate I'm confused I thought people do computer science just sit in a basement all day in the dark preferably well that's all they do Alice that's exactly why we have this volunteer program is the our of code is all about smashing stereotypes of computer science and so we really want to show students that computer science is not just a nerdy activity although if you want to sit in the basement and code away you have that's the option but our code is so much about introducing students especially students who may be not as inclined to try computer science because they don't usually see people who look like them or do things that are interesting for them and so you know talk about what computer science is not just from a coding perspective but what kind of products are you creating what kind of experiences are you creating what kind of what's your favorite fun project you've created with computer science um we really want to show students that you know this is a discipline that's not just for the Nerds it's not just for you know the people who've been doing it for the last 30 years anybody can learn and everybody should learn yeah one of the things I like to do when I go into a classroom is I start out like I tell the story I'm sure a lot of you guys have a similar story of what the first program you ever made was um and um and the reason to share that is often times it's a game or something fun or something that really relates to kids because they're the same age uh my first one was uh when I was in seventh grade and I figured out how to make my computer if my brother my little brother tried to break into it um it would beep really loudly and then a big letters ask Art would say SES you are trying to break into my computer this incursion has been logged um and so you know that kind of story is just fun it makes it seem more relatable um or if you know you build an app or if you done something that relates something youd actually want to do um those are really fun and you can also share happy outside of work you know like hey I'm really into whatever it is um knitting art you know you name it whatever you do outside of work photography um and then and then that just makes you seem more human which is great absolutely um so like again we've listed in our showcase tab this list of it's the Vol it's a volunteer file that you can see us teaching chips so please check that out um now we're GNA I see we already have some questions in there we're just going to go through a quick little more on the agenda and then we'll get to everybody's questions um when you're thinking about what to bring to your day of if you're working for a company um it'd be awesome if you want to bring some swag students pretty much of all ages love stickers pens anything else you want to bring to the classroom um again like Elsa bring your personal story how did you get into computer science um and definitely bring your enthusiasm so we're going to do a brief section on kind of day of what does it look like while you're actually there um so sign in to your school and greet the teacher um and just confirm the agreed schedule spend 5 to 10 minutes talking about computer science with the introduction share a short story share how CS has many broad implications um actually you know before you do that there's a u before you actually start talking I think the best way to start off is we've got a bunch of videos these inspirational videos um and okay so depending on the age of the classroom you got a bunch of kids they're loud they're noisy they're s everywhere the teacher usually pretty good at getting them to like pay attention um if you haven't been in a classroom in a long time it's kind of fun you know there'll be a little bit of like you know you know uh one two three look at me you know kind of thing that they cootes quiet coyotes um yes uh so you know it play along with the teacher so the teacher's like everybody do a little do and silence then you get to do it too um and that was the last costume I was in that was their silence move um so yeah so you do something like that and I love to start with a video because it takes the pressure off you it gets the kids all looking at something it gets them all quiet they start with the video we've got a bunch of inspirational videos on the site they're 60 seconds five minutes long really short things and just gets everybody like oh this is what computer science is about and then you can do your little five minute intro you don't want to go too long because the point of it is to let the kids try actually coding um so definitely don't talk for 30 minutes like the kids the the goal is to get them in front of a computer and get them experiencing it and then you can walk around the classroom once they're going you know helping out but um but yeah really you know usually a short video and then a really quick uh intro is the best way to kick things off and you can also bring them back at the end sure you getting there um to come back and talk so you don't feel like you have to say everything at the beginning just quick quick intro is the best way to go absolutely so once you've given your quick intro um what you'll definitely want to do is dive into the tutorial so classrooms are going to have different needs you might be in a computer lab where every student's on their own computer you might be in a classroom where there's a limited number of computers and we're doing ha programming they have a laptop cart maybe they don't have any computers and they're actually doing one of our super fun unplugged activities where everybody's up and moving around um again to make sure you talk to your teacher ahead of time so you have an expectation of kind of what you're going to be working with but once you dive into the tutorials help you know play a supporting role for the students learning so make sure we're letting students you know we want to see students learn for themselves and kind of puzzle through the tutorials they're definitely going to certain levels will be easier certain levels will be harder so it's kind of we love having the volunteer there to say oh okay you know well what might the answer be um definitely letting the students learn for themselves and then like Al said once you've kind of gone through your hour of code maybe some of the students have finished maybe all of them have finished you maybe come back do another kind of brief talk you know maybe what did we learn today ask a few questions you know maybe have the students say like what was your favorite part about today what are you excited to create with code next and then do we want to make a quick notice about photos and pictures oh right if you do want to take pictures of the event please please check with the teacher that this is okay you need to be have approval from the teacher and the students parents for legal reasons and privacy reasons you shouldn't be posting to your social media accounts unless you do have prior permission but we're we're very very interested in getting pictures so please do take some pictures if you do get approval send them into us we love sharing that um it'd be great to to see how your events with yeah tag them hashtag hour of code so we can see them and everybody else can see them all right so that's kind of our brief overview of what the agenda looks like else do you have any final wrapup comments or should we dive into answering questions I think we can dive in let's answer some questions um so let's the first question if you don't get contacted by a school your choice can you volunteer for a school absolutely you can volunteer for a school if you don't get contacted I said this earlier they missed it um we know a lot of you haven't been contacted especially if you live in a tech Hub because there's a lot of a lot of Volunteers in San Francisco and not a lot of Volunteers in Arkansas but if you live in a tech Hub and you have not been contacted um go go contact the school I have done this multiple times teachers love it schools love it um sometimes they're already doing an hour of code they would love to have somebody help them out um sometimes they are not doing an hour of code and I have you know talk to so many teachers I'm like first grade teacher I reach out and I'm like hey are you doing the hour of code would you like me to come in and just spend an hour with your classroom doing the coding exercise and they're thrilled they're thrilled to have somebody come in and do it they didn't think they could do it um I was last year I was working with this teacher who was like I we can do it but I don't know anything about the computer so you have to be in charge and I'm afraid of it and as long as you've got the whole thing we can do it and she was just nervous all the way up through it we finished it and at the end of it she said to me she said that was really fun can I do a coding Club um and so just being there and being that support can help trigger for that teacher the ability to feel confident to go do it on their own after that so yes please reach out please out time code is as much a learning experience for teachers as it is for students because we have so many teachers like wow I didn't even know I could teach computer science and now they're signed up to teach like our 20 hour course for 8 through five yeah um so which video works best um I think they're really short you can just watch them um and see what you think makes sense for different age groups um there's a new one that we have this year that's about inspiring girls if you're in a like an all girl school or something that's more girls oriented like a Girls Club um that would be the one I would show it's all about encouraging women in computer science if you're at a school that's you know boys and girls um I recommend one of the other ones and we have um what I like to do is typically I'm bring them up so I can remember the exact name of it but I like to play uh so change the world which is the first one that you'll see on the Inspire students video page um is the is the um um is the one for all girls um and then what I like to play is uh the first one here um either the computer science intro which is one minute long um or um the hour of code is here um which is also a really fun one for classes so you can try watch those po you one you like more um and try try one of those yeah if you have longer it depends if you have more time in the classroom you can play a longer one um so it really just depends how long you know a lot of classes it's an hour of code but you actually have more like 40 minutes because you've got a you know you get started the kids have to get there they have to open their laptops they have to get started you play the video you do a quick intro the kids have like 30 minutes to code before class is over um in which case you really want to compress it as more so you have more time for the kids to actually do the activity absolutely so do we have any more questions if you want to submit them to our Q&A little tab we can answer any final wrap up questions uh you might have about volunteering next week so I know while we're waiting to see if anybody else has question oh here it is um next question what if the school does not provide access to computers at all what would you success suggest yes um so you don't actually need computers at all to do the hour of code you can do the hour of code with no computers um we have a lot of un if you go to our site code.org learn there's a section on unplugged lessons and um and so if you look at those there are a bunch of activities that teach the concepts of computer science without actually needing any computers uh so I would recommend you look through those now when you do those you do need to be prepared to do them in the class so some of them require you to have cups for the kids to do a cup stacking activity so make sure either you or the teacher is bringing the cups into the classroom because you don't want to get there and um not be ready to teach those and those do require a little bit more work from you because if you're teaching an unplugged lesson there's it's not just put the kids in front of the computer let the computer teach it you've got to run that in front of the classroom so um if you are doing an unplugged lesson and you don't have computers uh it is important that you read through that and go through it and get ready and bring your materials um if you're doing with computers another way to think about it is you can do it uh you don't need a computer for every student PA programming is tons of fun the kids really learn from each other um so go ahead and try bringing you know two kids per student two students per computer or um you can do things like uh try different devices so if you guys have tablets instead of computers or you have um we really have stuff that works on the tutorials will work on any different device type so uh we had a question about which URL for the videos so that's code. org educate Inspire and I've also posted the link in the Showcase if you click the yellow little Postit Note Tab um you'll be able to have a quick link to to go to see the videos listed videos it's also in the agenda doc um which is listed in our chat box which is listed in our chat box I take the next question this is a great question about what tutorials are more appropriate for high school students and what would you recommend for students um maybe in elementary school yeah so um if you look on code.org ulearn at the very top there are tutorials that um we've made at code.org those are designed to work from grades uh basically as soon as they can read so grade one or two depending on when the kids read all the way through some kindergarteners all the way through high school and um if you do them with second graders they won't finish in an hour and that's fine they'll just get a really fun experience for an hour and they'll be done and they'll get partway through the experience if you do them with high school students they probably will finish in an hour and then they of time is preplay levels at the end so and say the Star Wars one they get to the end and they can make their own Star Wars game and so I watched one group of high school students get through the whole thing and then they went over the time they spent an extra hour just making Star Wars games um and that's totally fine the kids had a great time with it uh the Star Wars one actually has two versions one version if the kids can't type yet um and you'll see when you go there there's two go buttons one for blocks for younger kids and then one for older students it's in JavaScript and the kids who can type can go um even further with that and we've tested them on all those grades so we know that they do work um all the way up through high school and then if you go below our section the other tutorials are grouped by age and so the very top section there says JavaScript those tutorials um it's KH Academy I think we have code academy in there code HS all of those tutorials are designed for older students um they all involve typing and they're great for high school students so if you're looking for high school students that's right start if you are looking for younger students um it's also ask about middle school or elementary school kids uh grades four to five again the ones at the top will work great you can also where it says grades k through eight um there are great activities in there um my son is in fourth grade and he had a blast with the Tinker um the Tinker tutorial uh scratch is also great there's lots of great tutorials in there so just flip through that list and um you can play with them but we've preselected everything in there should be a good tutorial or it wouldn't be on the site now have a good oh oh that what you're about to talk about yeah own lessons yes yeah so we there is a new section at the bottom of code.org learn for teacherled lesson plans and there's a curated list of uh customized lesson plans that teachers have written so you're definitely uh encouraged to create your own custom uh hour of code event that works best for your students in your classroom so if if you scroll down to codor learn you'll see it's called teacher Le lesson plans and you'll have a big long list of of um Inspire yourselves to create your own um but yes absolutely you can create your own lesson plans yeah and actually it's worth pointing out so our all of our lesson plans are designed for um except for the teacher Le once everything else is designed for teachers who don't know computer science um and so it is they selfled the students go in front of the computer and so a teacher who has no computer science can do this with their students you guys know computer science so um you actually can do more than what's in the uh the activities you also it's I know computer science and I still have tons of fun with the student Le lesson plan so I that's what I plan to do this year it's just one of the student L ones and help them out and let the kids have fun with it but if you want to do something more custom because you know computer science go for it um you're totally you could do that um this is just a good question of what's a good way to get in contact with the local school so we just recommend if you go to hourofcode.com you'll see our big ginormous map with all of our events we've actually hit our event cap so we're we can't even add more new events because we've hit 150,000 um which is pretty pretty incredible we're about triple what we had last year um so yeah if you go to the map and you find a school that's listed in your area just look them up and you know maybe give their front office a call and say hey I saw that you're doing the RF code I'm a volunteer um could you put me in contact with the teacher who's participating and see if I could help help out in the classroom and you can also contact the school that's not doing it um if you have a kid um start with your own kids school because your parents you know the school that's a great place to start if you don't have a student at the school if you just call the school um you can ask to you can start with the front desk or ask if there's a science teacher at the school or a technology teacher at the school if it's a younger school like an elementary school they probably won't have one of those um so you can just ask for you know like a contact for you know third grade teachers or something that you want to work with um and see if they'll put you in touch or see if they'll forward your message that you're a volunteer and we also have a list of the events so you don't have to go clicking on each dot in your area you can also go to ARF cod.com events to see all the events that are happening in your state um and it'll also say which city they're in so you can search by that so we just have a few minutes left um we'll do some wrapup questions so this is a good question our schools only happening offline in schools are going to happen online as well definitely both it's just going to depend on each school's capacity for getting laptops into the classroom or the internet connectivity so um definitely just talk to your teachers so you know and they know kind of what the expectation is what tutorial you're going to do if it's online or offline if you have the choice at your school um in my experience what's the easiest to get working and working well is to do one of the online tutorials and use the computers uh the school's computers um if you haven't been to a school recently a lot of schools these days won't have computers in the classroom if you just go in there but if you ask the teacher can get computers into the classroom because they have things like laptop cards that they bring between the classroom so if the teacher reserves it in advance you can have computers and internet connectivity in the classroom so um trying to coordinate with the teacher on that is a good idea great so do we have any final wrapup questions and otherwise I think we're this has been recorded it's online um we've put a lot of links in the Showcase sidebar so please check them out um just a highlight again code.org learn is where you can find all of the tutorials um we've highlighted a handy kind of PDF of tips for what to do when you're in the classroom we've linked to our inspirational videos which you might want to show before you get started and we've also linked to hourofcode.com events to find an event in your area if you haven't um been in contact with a teacher yet um Alice do you have any final remarks before I wrap up thanks for volunteering we really appreciate it um and I know the teachers really appreciate it we um we've got a ton of requests this year for volunteers so really appreciate you guys stepping up and doing that hope you have fun yeah thanks so much everybody have a good day bye
