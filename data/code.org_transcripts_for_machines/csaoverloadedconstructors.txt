at my sandwich shop customers can only order one type of sandwich a turkey sandwich with no cheese that costs 2.99 but what if i want to allow customers to create their own sandwiches let's find out how we can do this the no argument constructor to create a sandwich object sets the values for our default sandwich in this case we set turkey for the meat false for has cheese and 299 for price a parameterized constructor is a constructor that has a set number of arguments to be passed its purpose is to assign userspecified values to the instance variables when instantiating an object i can use a parameterized constructor to allow customers to specify their meat and whether or not they want cheese on their sandwich let's write a parameterized constructor for the sandwich class with two parameters first we use the keyword public followed by the name of the class then an open set of parentheses inside the parentheses we will write the parameters for the meat and has cheese instance variables since meat is a string the first parameter will be a string the second is a boolean to set whether or not the sandwich object has cheese inside the body of the constructor we assign the values for the meat has cheese and price instance variables now we can call this constructor by giving ham for the meat instance variable and true for the cheese instance variable this sandwich will have a price of 299. we can also add more constructors with different signatures having multiple constructors is known as overloading overloading is defining two or more constructors or methods with the same name but different signatures let's create a constructor with one parameter to specify the meat in the body of the constructor we can initialize the meat instance variable to the type of meat the has cheese instance variable to false and price to 299. this constructor signature is different from the other two constructors we have in the sandwich class this is another example of overloading it lets a customer decide the type of meat but none of these sandwiches will have cheese when we call this constructor we can instantiate a new sandwich object with roast beef as the value for the meat instance variable the sandwich will have false for has cheese and 299 for price as software engineers we decide how many constructors our class should have each situation will be different depending on what we are representing with code creating multiple constructors allows our objects to be more customizable you
