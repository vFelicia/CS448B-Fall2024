hello everyone i'm maria from co.org thanks for joining us today for a special hour of code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week today we have Karlie Kloss joining the QA Carly's an entrepreneur and one of fashion's top models who plunged into her very first programming courses past year please join me in welcoming Carly morning Wallis beautiful but I'm excited to be here and I'm excited to talk to you guys I appreciate this opportunity to connect with you I wish I was actually there in person and could meet you guys but um this is kind of awesome that I'm sitting in my kitchen and I can talk to to you guys all over the country so I'm excited to be here so I'm ready to begin excellent our first question is from Fort Greene Preparatory Academy in Brooklyn New York good morning good morning take to your question okay so how does the model industry a technology work together first of all you look beautiful even a little fuzzy in this very beautiful um yeah I you know surprisingly the modeling industry and the technology world are connected in many more ways than you would imagine um I started modeling when I was 15 years old actually 14 years old so probably the age of a lot of you guys out there I too in the last 8 years of working in the fashion industry and as a model I seen the way that technology has really impacted the world but specifically my job as a model it's essentially given me a voice you know platforms like Instagram like Twitter like Facebook give me an opportunity to sort of show Who I am and and sort of what I think and connect with people all around the world in a way that just was never possible before so as a model um you know I'm able to connect with you guys through my platforms through Instagram you know I can share with you what I'm doing today or you know backstage at Fashion Week I can share that with you um and and I think that's really exciting because that just was never possible before is the modeling industry and the fashion industry which is foods very sort of small and exclusive and if you work backstage at the show you had no idea that it even was going on so through these sort of platforms I can connect with anybody who cares to follow and the other really interesting cool part is that I think in fashion you know there's so many cool ways that technology and fashion are sort of working together like I don't know if you guys everyone anyone has like a jawbone or wearable tech like a Fitbit or you know all of all of a sudden a wearable tech has been on the runway Google Glasses Diane von Furstenberg head Google glasses in her runway Tory Burch also so a lot of these fashion designers are realizing that fashion and technology there's unlimited potential to work together so surprisingly there's a lot of crossover and and it's been cool because I've seen I've seen it happen throughout my career since I was 15 since I was your age I was I had a job working in the fashion industry so I've learned a lot our second question is from Wilde Lake Middle School in Columbia Maryland whoo hello go ahead are you guys seeing the question okay how did you get started in coding oh oh hi my name is idea what is I hired you hello my name is Kayla and who helped you get started these are awesome questions um especially since I don't think it's normally what you would expect a model in fashion to care about coding um and and I think that's why I really enjoy it is because it's something so it's something that you know you would think I have no reason to know or to care about but I don't think it matters if you're a fashion model or if you're you know a student in middle school or high school you know with that skill set with knowing how to code or at least even understanding that it's the way that everything is built I think that's so important and even if you're not you know a programmer and that's not the career you want to go into great we'll move on to our third question from Gateway High School in Monroeville Pennsylvania cool okay so our school wanted to know what the coolest thing you've made so far with code is or was okay so I'm very proud of it because I think drones are amazing kind of scary but they're a really exciting technology and I learned how to program drones to ship essentially just fly and we were practicing sort of within a classroom space so it didn't we didn't even have to think about factors like wind like rain but the idea of programming a drone to you know potentially deliver something that's what I was playing with so I don't know um I'll tell you a little bit about me I have outside of my modeling career I have this sort of charity project that I have a cooking line like a vegan healthy but yummy cookie line and I thought it'd be cool to deliver the cookies via drone or at least potentially someday down the line deliver my cookies via drone so I am I programmed the drone to sort of fly across the room and it sounds really easy but it was surprisingly complicated because there were just so many things that you have to think about you know how fast to fly the drone how far it was really fun though um but yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of a nerd if you can't pick that up by now but um programming drones was probably the funnest thing I've learned so far very cool all right our fourth question is from Shelburne Community School in Shelburne Vermont our fourth question is from Shelburne Community School in Shelburne Vermont hi I'm Delaney and in your opinion why do you think more girls should study computer science so when I was in school a middle school and high school Computer Sciences wasn't offered as an option even to two boys or girls just to any student and I really wish I would have been exposed to this the opportunity to understand it is the language that essentially writes everything it's why what you and I are able to talk right now over a Google hangout is because somebody wrote that with code and not something that I just have learned in year of taking lessons and the teacher or learning the basics of computer sciences I don't really want to be a computer scientist III but I I'm fascinated by coding and I want to have the ability to write code I don't think you know I don't think you have to you don't have to go into that as your major in college to care and I think that's that's the cool thing is that you guys are in middle school in high school now and you're already thinking about it you're already starting to understand that it that it exists and that it's a really powerful language that if you learn you have unlimited opportunity in any industry that you want to go into you know you can go into fashion with this skill set you can go into any industry and I think that's really empowering as a girl or as a boy but as a girl I think it's really cool if you know how to go great alright our fifth question is from westerly high school in Westerly Rhode Island very good hi we were wondering how deeply technology will impact daily life in the future how long I wish I had a crystal ball because I would make some investments in those companies that are going to disrupt the world and you know III think it's it's been really exciting to live in New York City where so much is happening so many companies are here building a building sort of taking an idea and building it out into an app or into you know a business that is transforming how we live and you know III don't know how where we'll go but I just know that we are the next generation and we are the ones that you know it's with this ability to speak this language and to to take an idea and build it into a product or an app or you know it's it's like a superpower you know having this ability is is you can do anything and so I don't know I think um I I think that it's impacted my daily life quite a bit and that's why I'm taking interest in you know even just understanding how it's written and it's really cool because I you know living in New York City even though I work in the fashion industry I've been able to meet and talk with a lot of different founders of Instagram of Twitter of snapchat you know I've met all the people that have difficulties companies and I'm fascinated by that I'm fascinated by them I think that um and and they're normal people just like us you know and I think that's the really cool part is that you know we we can build anything you know with just understanding learning how to speak this language and I think that's really really kind of a superpower in my opinion right our sixth question is from Alden school in Duxbury Massachusetts hi you've been all over the world modeling and you've met all kinds of people from different backgrounds how do you think learning code helps to connect us all as a world community you're right I've traveled when switches and it's hard to communicate you know even just getting around so over the last eight years I've traveled to Paris quite a lot for my job and I've learned French along the way which is you know just completely transformed my ability to connect and speak with people and I think the interesting thing is again you know Ruby you know I'm learning to code Ruby and like I can write something in Ruby that somebody in Paris somebody in Tokyo you know can can read as well you know and and build off of its this universal language that I think almost even simplifies I connecting with people around the world in a way that is really exciting because it means that together as a global community we can build things by actually even working together even if we don't speak the same you know English or a French you can you can work together to build something using code and I think that that's that's pretty cool all right our last and seventh question is from school crow Valley High School in leesport Pennsylvania hi my name is Genesis eight Ron what what are you most proud of accomplishing thus far in your career um I I actually really lucky to have the job that I have I really like my job um mainly because it it gives me an opportunity to do cool things like this hang out with you guys on a Thursday morning uh you know you guys are in classrooms all around the world are all around the country at least and I'm sitting in my kitchen even though we're having technical difficulties it's still pretty cool that we can connect and I really I think the coolest part of of my career is that I feel like I get to see I get to see firsthand the impact that technology is having on for instance my job and my industry and but also through this job that I have in these platforms like Instagram or Twitter or Facebook I can use that to talk about things or that that interest me and that I think are important to share like how powerful this skill set is to be able to to be able to write code and if nothing else to even just know that it exists you're really beautiful by the way all right well thank you Carly for your support of co.org and for being such a great inspiration for all of us everyone let's give Carly a big round of applause okay John here's today boy I'm jealous I'm going to be in class with you guys alright more fun have a great day keep coding and go for your dreams thanks for joining us today goodbye
