hi my name is j Whitney I'm an officer for our indigenous communities fellowship at Mat solve and I'm originally from the chalk toown nation of Oklahoma the thing that I love about computer science is the way that it Blends technology and creativity it has this kind of innate logic or language to it that you can learn and then use that to take your own spin to it and build your own projects or ideas and be able to share those with the world when I was growing up we went to the public library a lot and I loved getting all different kinds of books but I especially loved getting children's poetry books by authors like shell Silverstein and Jack pruty and I loved how they had these funny poems next to like weird little drawings that they did and so that really inspired me to do the same thing I published my first book of poetry at age 15 I think I had two different types of poems so one poem type was the funny silly I just want to be creative and see what kind of weird things I can do and then the other kind was more of a I have all these big feelings that I'm trying to sort through and I want to add some kind of order to them and so by putting them into poetry it made them feel like more tangible and more easy to deal with I think the thing that I did borrow from my tribe is similarly in our storytelling we have a lot of like anthropomorphic animals and so I think that kind of maybe more absurdist approach to like how can these weird things teach us important life lessons poetry and computer science are similar in the sense that you can use them to express yourself in different ways and I think both of them have an end result that is sort of concrete that you can share with others and by using those forms of selfexpression you can also help to understand your own identity better
