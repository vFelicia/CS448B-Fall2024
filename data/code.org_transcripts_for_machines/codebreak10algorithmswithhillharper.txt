welcome you all hill how are you doing doing great how's it going everybody who's that you have with you hill piers let's come down a little bit so you can get on the screen so pierce is here say hi pierce hi i'm my name is not pierce today pierce is black panther he is not pierce uh so that's what today is so we're not even all right we're now up to 500 people in the audience this is pretty uh amazing to watch there's about 20 people joining almost every second so we're now at 550 people in the audience okay anybody that's joining tell other people to come on this is going to be the largest live interactive classroom happening and we're going to learn to code together bring your kids bring the family gather around let other people know this is happening and it's live so we now have 600 people in the audience and i'm just going to get started while people are joining so welcome to code break there's a few dozen of us on screen but there's hundreds of more tuning in and about 20 or 30 joining every second uh this is our first time doing something this we're going to find ways for everybody to interact together if you've ever joined zoom meetings and you're looking at this one you don't have all the same tools because there's too many of us to talk at all the same time together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom if you enjoy it please invite others to join i'm gonna enjoy i'm gonna invite my daughter sophia to join in hi hi sophia yeah i am sophia i'm 11 years old and i'm in fifth grade let's go fifth grade it's awesome hey pierce what grade are you in pick hey he's a pre prek yeah i love projects sound board she's gonna make sound effects for our show so so if you will right now all right today our special guest is actor and author hill harper who's on screen right now obviously for those of you who are still tuning in welcome uh so hill how are you doing right now how are you handling this whole quarantine situation hey everybody um you know being quarantined or doing self quarantine is is it's been it's been interesting for sure uh one thing that's done is that pierce and i get to spend a lot more time together which is which is which is i think great um and at the same time though you know i just feel for all those people out there and all those uh folks who who are who are actually suffering with with health consequences and just reminding everybody that you know staying at home doing this you you don't see the benefits immediately it's kind of like i guess learning to code in a way right you it's we do this now to reap the benefits for weeks from now months from now and we save lives so so if we can do this together for instance build community online through things like this um hopefully we can establish some measure of learning and normalcy but at the same time reinforce that if a virus can spread so can love and so can support and so can learning in the same exact way and so we can we can represent that here so i'm so excited that so many people are on great excited to have my son here with me and and sophia great to see you and and and uh thanks for organizing this of course we had a corny joke for you hill to get things started where do all the cool mice live where do all the cool my slip pierce where do all the cool mice live do you want to give me an answer right yes pad in their mouse pad in their mouse pad i like it sorry i made i put sophie up to it but let's switch to gallery view so we can see all the students who are joining us right now live so you can see all the faces on screen everybody hi students hello hey everybody i'm gonna take you all off of mewtwo anthony and braden anika gabby and xavier we're going to unmute all of you right now and just say hi to you specifically anthony and brady hello hi where are you all from san francisco san francisco awesome what grade are you guys in second second are you guys related yeah oh really what's your relation we're twins oh you're twins oh i would have never guessed that that's amazing that's amazing i'm a twin that's pretty funny uh how about anika are you there anika yeah hi hi anika what grade are you what grade ninth grade ninth grade why where are you i'm in orient illinois very nice favorite subject my favorite subject is spanish oh espanol como esta hi gabby and xavier how are you hey where are you all calling from headway midway massachusetts all right so for everybody else who's in the live audience there's almost a thousand people already uh click to see if you haven't found it already there's a button like this called chat because we want to hear from all of you as well and you click this button look for the blue button that chooses who you're chatting with and choose all panelists and attendees it's a big blue button and people are asking there's a there's over a thousand people here but what i want everybody who's chatting can you stop for a second and not type for a little bit of seconds so we can then ask a question for everybody to answer what i want to ask is everybody tell us what city are you in so seattle calgary what are you seeing there hill oh i see columbus las vegas vienna wow it's going so fast chicago oh houston oh bellevue i can't remember washington all right so everybody stop typing that lady now i want to ask for the folks who are there what grades are you in for the students who are there what's up pakistan pakistan seventh grade sixth grade seventh sixth fourth sixth forty fourth grade that's that's a big one fifth fifth dubai yuri what grade five tonight's tenth then fifth first third fourth third third second kindergarten there's so many all right we have one last question we want to get a sense of people's coding capability or computer science capability so everywhere in the chat window if you're a beginner type of one if you're intermediate type of two and if you're relatively advanced as a coder type of three we want to get a sense of how many people here have experienced one computer program two one one two one one one one a lot of ones a lot of twos a lot of uh there's the twenty two very advanced eleven there wow i saw a one thousand we have a one thousand yeah there's a three there's a three out there's a 2.5 wow okay so there's some advanced coders in here there's also some a lot of beginners like me like pierce pierce and i are beginners we're we are minus one minus one all right so for those of you who are calling in from a mobile device whether on a tablet or a phone close the chat now we're gonna let you know when to open up again so we want you all to be able to see the whole screen for those of you who are older or more experienced please stick with us through the end even if you said that you're a three level coder we're always going to start with easier material but we're also then going to get more advanced too by the end of today's code break you should be able to make pretty cool stuff with only a few lines of code let me give you an example of what we're going to learn to do by the end of today with just five lines of code i'm going to share my screen to show you what we're going to make so if you see my screen right now this shows you what we'll be able to create all of the drawings here will be able to do with only five lines of code what do you think sophia sophia is going to do our sound effects she's my daughter here that's that's impressive that is very impressive sofia is our lead coder uh now let's talk a little bit about code break each week we're going to host weekly episodes with special guests like today we have actor and author hilla harper and we're so lucky to have you on board we're going to cover computer science concepts in a fun and collaborative way and then at the end we're going to send challenge questions for folks to do at home so if you haven't signed up already to get the challenge questions you can give us your email address at code.org break or if you just google code break you'll find it we're not going to send any kind of spam marketing messages just just the challenge questions from each week's episode and if you have any questions during today's show you can ask us these questions there's a button for q a if it's a question about what you're seeing or really any kind of computer science question feel free to ask it at any time and then we're going to take a break a few times during the hour to see people's answers the last thing i want to say before we start is this is our first time doing this nobody that i know has ever run an interactive classroom at the scale of a thousand people before uh and certainly we haven't we're we're figuring it out as we go uh and so please bear with us if things break we're gonna learn a very important computer science concept called debugging so if you have the drawing you made of that for this this is a bug sophia drew this bug a bug in computer science is when something breaks and you need to figure out how to fix it so if anything breaks sophia is going to hold up this bug and we'll fix it if my screen goes out always the solution there's always a fix there's always a fix in some classes there's a right and wrong answer and if you get it wrong you're just wrong in computer programming if you get it wrong you can tweak it and improve it and see if you can debug it and so we'll probably going to be doing that a couple of times today so today the concept we're going to learn about is algorithms it's a computer science concept we're going to learn but we're going to learn this with a little bit of fun we're going to have three stages in today's code break segment one is gonna be learning unplugged algorithms segment two we're gonna do some live coding at a beginner level and then segment three we're gonna do some intermediate coding uh as we go along are you all ready to get started yes i am let's go so sound effects all right we're gonna learn about algorithms that's my favorite thing hottie algorithms i i feel like i am an algorithmic expert all the time awesome so an algorithm is a list of steps you give to a computer for what you want to do and we're going to do this by having our participants give instructions to give an algorithm to code to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich so if i want to see all the students who joined us on screen i we told you in advance to write down your instructions for how to make a pb and j sandwich so if you have those can you hold up your instructions you wrote down on paper so we can see them all all right so i'm going to call out to somebody right before you start i want to ask everybody a question first okay a lot of people there was controversy about peanut butter versus almond butter so i got both i want to see what people want do they want me to make an almond butter sandwich with organic almond butter or do they want me to make a peanut butter oh that's moderation ray's hand to do that which one so to do this you have a button for ray's hand at the bottom of the screen raise your hand click this button if you want peanut butter click it if you want to be peanut butter raise your hand all right i see three four hundred and fifty cents 490 500 let's say 500 raised hands i think peanut butter is going to be winning here well you never know almond butter could make a big comeback no there's no way more than half of them want people no but they may vote again raise your hand lower your hands everybody lower your hands and we can lower your hands for you automatically to get it done peanut butter one you're right yeah peanut butter one peanut butter one all right so now sylvia and mark and nia are you all ready uh we're gonna unmute you so we can hear from you sylvian mark can and nia can somebody unmute sylvia and mark and nia i'm not sure whether you need to unmute on your end so we can hear you we're having trouble unmuting sylvia and mark all right uh nia are you ready can somebody unmute and yes the first panelists are for students to give us all right there we are silvia and mark thank you and first i should say that was our first bug so um nia we're going to hear from you right now nia we want to hear your instructions for making pb j sandwich but first can you say hi to us i can't hear can you get here we might have broken zoom i'm not even sure nia can you can you say hello let's go back to sylvia i can hear the twins i think sylvia and mark can we hear from you all right let me switch to somebody else we're going to switch to darius and mozzie darius and mazzy are you there yes can you guys hear us hi hi hi darius and mazzy all right so muzzy we want you to give hill directions for how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich so think in your mind how do you make peanut butter and jelly sandwich hill's got his peanut butter he's got bread and jelly and then give him the instructions but what's really important is you can you can't change the instructions after he'll started doing stuff you just need to tell him what to do mozzie are you ready have darius do it all right darius you could do it go ahead pick up a slice of bread and lay it flat on the table pick up a slice of bread and lay it flat on the table you really going to have me make a peanut butter sandwich on my table is that is that for me but i'm going to do it go ahead yep go um pick up a jar of jelly okay and untwist the lid to open it i'm twisting the lid to open pick up pick up your knife hello hello i don't have any hands left how do i pick up the knife put down the jar of jelly using the sharp side of the knife scoop out some jelly and put on the bread okay is this enough do more do more how much just do a lot until you think it's enough okay i'm gonna do a lot good job that should be enough okay phil can you bend down your now pick up your container of peanut butter open the peanut butter and do the exact same thing with the peanut butter that you did with the jelly okay put a lot on the bread okay it's not coming out the same way what do i do scoop it out using the knife okay good job now put okay stop stop stop now put the now pick up another slice of bread and put it on top of all of that stuff how do i pick it up put down everything you're holding just drop it [Laughter] pick up your pick up i think i broke my table what i think i broke my table that's okay don't that's not what we're worrying about right now pick up another slice of bread put it on top of your mound of jelly and peanut butter good job there you go all right can we all give hill a round of applause for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich oh no it's a pretty big sandwich you want to try the salmon yeah so what we just saw we all remember when you're talking to a regular person we all know that when you're talking to a regular person they follow instructions way better than hill just did hill acted the way a computer would when you're giving instructions to a computer you have to be very precise a computer may seem smart but it's actually not smart at all no offense hill we know that you were acting a computer needs to hear instructions in the language it expects and they will make mistakes if you tell it to it'll eat as much peanut butter as you tell it to it doesn't know what you want it to do it only knows what you tell it to do remember the word of the day algorithm an algorithm is a list of steps you have a computer to finish a task it's like a recipe or driving directions and just now we made an algorithm for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich now we're going to switch to doing some algorithm coding on a computer next but first i want to take a quick break for a trivia question it's trivia time sophia's got a trivia time sound so are you all ready for a trivia question remember the raise hand button we had i want you all to lower your hands so uh the folks in the control room can you lower everybody's hands so the trivia question for today's day is to ask was the first computer programmer a man or a woman was the first computer programmer a man or a woman raise your hand if you think the first computer programmer was a man all right how many hands do you see there hill how many hands do you see raise i see 199 hands raised 200 hands raids 208 hands raised 200. either people think it's a woman or they just don't know 230 230 people think it's a man all right 240. all right now everybody lower your hands lower your hands and the next question we want to ask is raise your hand if you think the first computer programmer was a man sorry it was a woman if you think the first computer programmer was a woman i do clicked click the raise hand button so what do you think computer programmer was a woman ray's hand wow there's a lot more people raising their hand thinking it's a woman so hill what do you think is the right answer oh i think it's definitely a woman there's no doubt about it i saw the movie hidden figures with my friend taraji p henson so i know it was a woman that's right i'm not saying it was kathleen johnson but you know so i'm sharing my screen right now do you all see my screen share wow my computer's going nuts with everybody's hands raised can somebody lower the hands so the first computer programmer was a woman named ada loveless ada lovelace i knew that i knew it all right well aydah loveless is the first known computer programmer and what's really interesting about ada loveless is not only that she was the first computer programmer but that she wrote the first computer program in 1842 almost 100 years before the first computer was even invented or built so before we had any kind of computers to do the stuff we do for smartphones a hundred years earlier aydah loveless wrote the first computer program and the reason this is interesting is because a loveless did something very similar to what we did with our unplugged algorithm which we wrote for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich she was writing a computer program on paper so now we're gonna go do some real coding to make a computer program so i'm gonna go back to my screen share and sophia is going to do the coding for us sophia are you ready yes right uh so i'm going to go share my screen again sophia here is a practice coder but this is her first time doing something like this in front of such a large audience can you all see my screen again yes you can see the screen great sophia i'm going to explain the screen and what we see right here on the left side of the screen what you see is an artist he's a little guy with a big pencil and he's going to draw whatever we tell him to do in the middle of the screen you see the blocks for what the artist can do those are his commands and then on the right side of the screen is where sophia is going to make the code now sophia drag out one block to see what is going to happen all right so hill what do you think is going to happen when we drag out this one block it's going to the depends the artist is going to move straight across and draw something that's 100 pixels long i'm going to move forward for 100 pixels all right it sounds like you may have some prep for for doing this so the artist is going to move forward 100 pixels are we right sophia are you going to hit the r oh you want to make a sound effect that's right all right so we do a hundred pixels and what's important about the artist is anytime he moves he's drawing if you want him to move without drawing you can use this jump command now the next thing i want to do is sophia is going to draw something with some instructions i'm gonna whisper in her ear and tell her what she's gonna draw and i want everybody in the audience to take out a piece of paper and a pencil and follow along as sophia's writing commands for the computer and draw what you think the computer is going to make and then we'll see if you got it right so sophia everybody follow along at home with a piece of paper and pencil and see if you can follow what sofia is doing and maybe you can draw the same shape as her and then we're going to see if you got it right so if you need to reset 90 degrees move forward turn right move forward 100 pixels turn right by 90 degrees move forward 100 pixels turn right move forward 100 degrees and turn right one last time all right has everybody at home made their own guess as to what is going to happen i want to switch to see everybody we're going to stop the screen share and i want everybody who's on camera if you've drawn what you think is going to happen hold your drawing in front of the camera so we can see it those of you who aren't on camera can you type your guess into the chat box if you remember the chat box is the little sort of the thing that looks i don't know if you can see my camera or not but it looks like this click that and type your guess into the chat box hill what are you seeing on screen or in the chat what are people getting square square square box box box square square square box box box box square square square box box square square box so sophia are you ready to to share what happens you wanna do a drumroll sound before we see the answer look the drum roll oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah all right we have a square now again this is very beginner stuff any of you who've done coding before have known how to do this but we're gonna now get much faster quickly and do more interesting stuff so the first thing we want to do is to make our square a different color sophia can you choose a color for the square can you make it just be a random color all right now the square is going to set color to random so when you run it it's going to be a different color each time can you run it let's make it a little bit faster so it goes more quickly and i'll draw another square what color is that pink okay draw another square pink oh another square purple all right so we're getting lots of different colors but i'd love to see lots of these colors happen all at the same time so you can see multiple squares so i want to ask some of the folks who are on camera to to tell us how we can do that so uh can we unmute uh jack barry and we want to hear from you to see what your ideas are in terms of how we can get more squares on the screen because we want to have multiple squares of different colors uh jack are you there yep hi jack so how would you suggest for us to get multiple squares instead of having her to run and then stop and run and stop all over again uh multiple artists i guess multiple artists no we want one artist to do multiple squares a forever loop on a rotation a loop on a rotation and is barry there by any chance or is barry your last name no that's where i am oh you're from barry okay so multiple loops on a rotation so looking at the blocks that you see on the screen can you figure out a block that we can use for doing that uh the pink repeat question mark question mark question mark times all right let's drag that out so that block can repeat anything you put inside it as many times so how many times should we have this happen can folks in the chat window say how many times do we want to repeat and see a square four there's one percent four four five i want more 100 because somebody said 100. somebody said 100 sophia you want to type 100 in here and just make it go real fast so i want to see it fast and i want to see a hundred fast and 100 super fast super fast all right hit run surf all right let's stop this so that's a hundred squares going by super fast but jack if you're still on there those squares are all on top of each other can you think of ideas how we can see those squares but see them all separate from each other yeah um either when they're done maybe set a script to turn them or move them somewhere else which of those do you want to do uh let's turn okay do a turn so after each square we're going to turn the artist a little bit why don't you turn them like three degrees and change the number up here to 120 so longer all right now hit run is everybody ready to see what's gonna happen drum roll oh yeah oh yeah i see in the chat room somebody wants us to do them like a trillion trillion squares and one thing i want to say for whoever typed that alex t and harley hendrickson who wanted a trillion trillion squares one of the amazing things about computer programming is you can tell a computer to repeat something as many times as you want and it doesn't get tired it doesn't say oh i want to go to bed the computer will repeat an algorithm over and over and it'll not make mistakes it'll do exactly what you tell it to do now you make mistakes in what you tell it but after you tell it what you want to do and then you ask it to repeat it it will do it over and over so we could have done a hundred times or a thousand times i think if we hit a million times i think that might have broken our computer because our computer here isn't good zach good job excellent thank you so much zach so i want to do something else now uh let's make this drawing a little bit more interesting we're going to add a cool little sticker to it sophia can you drag out the sticker block it's down at the bottom of the screen now i want to add the sticker right after the first move forward block so the first move block is when we begin the square so what are our options for what we can put in a sticker wow wow there's a lot of stickers there i'm also seeing a lot of people raising their hands if you raise your hand if you have questions type them into the q a area but now i want people to tell us what sticker should we use you see all these options for stickers on the screen type in your sticker choices and we can choose from them and he'll tell me what you said goes penguin wizard ninja i've seen a few penguins i think penguin a lot of penguins a lot of people penguin that's way too many choices let's let's actually do something different i want to have us take a simpler vote so i want us to choose between four options and we're going to choose the top four options you wanted a penguin hill well i i was just i was just being the voice of the people yeah the voice of the people you think is a penguin what what do you want as your favorite option oh um i'm my favorite option i like this little guy down here bottom left i don't even know what you call him but he's got the big eyes and he's hanging out little guy down here all right sophia what do you want uh let's do the chicken where's the chicken i don't know can you point to the chicken that one there the chicken yeah and that's the guy's name number two what is his name i'm gonna choose a little alien oh not an alien it's a zombie all right so now in the chat room type the number for who you want number two you guys number two number two go two take two big two all right hill it sounds like everybody wants your choice so we're gonna go with number two here and we're gonna close our little voting area sophia you wanna choose the little guy a little guy with the big eyes over there little guy with the big guys and now for the turns here can we make each of these turns 33 degrees apart so people can see these stickers a little bit apart all right now hit run oh yeah so every time we draw a square we're adding a sticker and it's doing it over and over again 120 times that little guy is getting repeated many many times and so it's basically adding to our picture here now one thing you notice is i change the angle as we're going along one of the best things about computer programming in computer science is unlike a lot of subjects you learn in school it's not just about getting it right or getting it wrong what we're doing here is just we're being creative and we're playing around so there's not really a right or wrong answer just like an art class your art teacher doesn't usually tell you oh that that picture was wrong or you got it right you're just making something pretty that you can then share and when you're done making it you can click the finish button and you can see what you made you have a url to it that you can send you can send it to your mom or dad's phone or if you have a social media account if you are a mom and dad you can post it to social media or if you want to change it and you want to keep going you can click keep playing and mess around with it some more that's going to be my new profile shot on my instagram it's going to be all right people are going to love it so uh i'm going to stop the screen share for a second and i want to see if we have any questions from our from the folks who've been in the audience we might not but uh i want to give a chance if folks have had any questions from what they've seen before and these could be questions about what's honorary fans there's a lot of raised hands we did have one question um it was specifically for hill was the peanut butter and jelly sandwich delicious what type of jelly was it where did you get it oh okay well i'll answer that it was organic wild maine blueberry jam so this is from maine um fancy stuff great state from stonewall kitchen and then the peanut butter was this organic peanut butter from trader joe's which is good now the bread was this some kind of some kind of organic seedless bread whatever i think that the directions overdid the jam it's too sweet it's too much jam in a jam to peanut butter ratio i'm eating it anyway because i'm really hungry but it's a little the jam to peanut ratio is not programmed properly and that's no knock against the programmer i know that it was their first time programming a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or coding one so i think the next time we code this like hottie said there's no right or wrong that we should code less jam and more peanut butter and maybe even less bread to be honest i i could do for just like one slice folded over something like that but that's just me that's just me personally all right there's a question from christine hawley asking about the artist saying is forward relative to where you are because when sophia said move forward turn right move forward turn right i thought it was going to be stairs because i thought forward always meant right and so christine forward depends on which direction the artist is facing if the artist is facing right move forward takes it to the right side of the screen when the artist turns right then it turns relative to where it was already pointed and then it points down and then it moves forward to go down and then if it turns right again it'll actually be facing left so and each time it moves it goes in a direction and each time it turns it changes that direction all right that's a good question so howdy just so i know how did would you do steps since she thought that was steps how would you do steps do you want to take a guess at that hill i absolutely do not okay i assume you go move forward left then go move forward right move forward left move forward right exactly move forward turn left which is actually going to then punch you up and then go up in fact let's go do that right now and i'll show you how that would work uh if i take these squares and i'm just going to take go back to your screen so we can see you cody yeah sorry thank you and we're a little bit off script but i want to do this because somebody asked a question about it and it'd be helpful to see the difference and then we're going to get into advanced coding afterwards so here we are and what i'm going to do is i'm going to reset this little thing we have with the sticker and i'm going to get rid of the sticker for now but we'll bring it back in a second we're going to move forward 100 and then you set to turn left then move forward and turn right and then move forward and turn left then move forward and turn right and if we do that it'll draw stairs and i can make it so that each one of these stairs is is 10 steps long and in fact after i just do two stairs like this move forward turn left i can then repeat that 120 times [Laughter] and it's drawing stairs of different colors wow wow you sound super excited sophia so christine thank you so much for that wonderful question i'm not sure if you uh we're hoping to get that much attention to your question but thank you christine and we hope you try coding yourself and after the show we're going to send the links so you can practice with this but what i want to do next is to show more advanced coding and if you remember and you can see on my screen we're now in section three of showing more intermediate level coding sofia are you ready for this part yeah so i'm going to be doing the coding on this part now and uh sophia is going to be making sound effects and making fun of me as we go along and we're now in a slightly more advanced version of the same tool so this is a more advanced version of artists you have the same blocks but they're not all laid out here they're in different sections so there's action blocks like move forward or turn right or jump forward there's brush blocks and one of them for example sets the width of the brush i'm going to set the width of the brush to 1 so it's like draws a thin line so we can draw more finetuned stuff but you can see we have loops like the repeat block and these other things like logic for if then statements or functions and variables and these are other computer science concepts that we're going to learn over time so the first thing i want to do is show how we can just draw a simple square like we did before i'm going to draw a repeat block and again this is going to be relatively simple but then we're going to get a little bit more advanced so i'm going to say let's move forward let's say 50 pixels and then turn right 90 degrees and a square if we move forward turn right and repeat it over and over four times this should draw a square it's a fewer lines of code to draw a square how exciting was that sif all right sophia's falling asleep um now we can try try drawing different squirt shapes by drawing angles so let's draw let's say a triangle that's got three sides so i'm going to repeat three times what's the angle we should do for a triangle this is something that gets confusing sometimes because if you're in math class you know that the angle of the inside of a triangle if it looks like this is 60 degrees but when when we're an artist the artist is actually turning so the artist's angle is this outside angle of the turn that's 120 degrees the inside of the triangle over here is 60 degrees so if we have a 120 degree turn and we do it three times we get a triangle and we can now do a hexagon six times and since i've done this before we can go 660 degrees and this will draw a hexagon or we can go you want to do pentagon sophia pentagon is 72 degrees now i've memorized these degree numbers but you can just learn them through experiment you think i haven't memorized an octagon i'll figure it out for an octagon it's 45 degrees and we can do eight times [Laughter] all right was that exciting for you sophia wow you got excited by that sophia has never seen me draw an octagon before um so now i'm going to change this to say we can do whatever shape we want so instead of repeating eight times i'll say let's repeat 100 times and so we can change different degrees so we can make very few degrees sorry very tight turns like 160 degree turns and if we hit reset and run look what it does and it just goes over and over on top of itself or we can make a slightly weirder number and now it's going to draw this cool little circle but now i want to show a different type of repeat loop because what we're doing right here is just repeating over and over and over and drawing the same line and then uh and and basically it's the same and by the way i want to say for some people that are asking how is this coding even working why is it going with blocks instead of what they expect as coding everything we're doing here is actually under the hood is javascript so if you see this right here this is the javascript code that matches the blocks over here it's literally the same thing but this is how computer programmers in the real world do it they write this stuff by typing it instead of dragging and dropping blocks but it doesn't matter you can do the same thing with blocks and when we learn about algorithms it doesn't matter whether you're typing or not it's matters which blocks and which commands you use so what we're going to do now is do this new type of loop instead of the repeat loop we're going to do a for loop so if you have you learned this before this is your first time too isn't it this for loop is a counter and we said let's repeat before we were saying let's repeat 100 times so we can do the same thing let's count from one to a hundred a thousand uh i'll say it's count from one to five hundred um actually but you can choose how much you wanna count by so let's count by fives so i'm gonna count from or shall we count by threes we'll count from three to five hundred going in steps of three each okay so it's going to go 3 6 9 and so on and what we're going to do is after each step it's going to move forward 50 pixels but if you run this it's just basically drawing a square what we can do is since the counter is changing it starts at three and then it goes at six hill what do you think we could do to make each one of these steps a different length we could change change the number of pixels it moves forward right so instead of going 50 pixels now what number you can do if you want it to be different each time there's a variable called counter that matches what's happening in the repeat loop have it add 10 pixels every time it goes so it's the first time it's going to be going three pixels the next time six because we start at three and it's going to go to 500. that's it and we'll run this in really slow motion so you see what it does it goes forward three turns goes forward six turns goes forward nine then twelve then fifteen then eighteen then 21 and then 24. do you want to make it faster sophia all right we're going to go faster the nice thing is computers can go super fast sophia is that good for you yeah all right so look how few lines of code it took to do this just counting move forward turning right and now what's great about this is if you experiment with this here we can do lots of interesting things so now i can do 120 degrees like what makes a triangle and i run the same thing and it makes a triangle like shape [Laughter] you want to do an octagon we can do the oops we haven't done an octagon before except a little bit earlier if you do the same thing with an octagon it makes an octagonlike shape now i want to show something else we can do we can go into brushes and choose a different pattern for the brush there's many patterns we can choose from here there's four or five so can folks in the chat room say what pattern we should use you can see a line a rainbow a rope a squiggly or what would you call this one here it's a chain a chain all right what are folks asking for rainbow is winning by a rainbow is winning by a total landslide so let's do a rainbow and i'm going to run this ready set go all right that's pretty cool so i want to try something different i'm going to go back to a regular line and going back to the way we were doing it as a square do you remember when we had this as a square when it drew like this what's pretty cool is if you make it just this is a 90 degree turn which is what squares have but what if we made it just a little bit less or more than 90 degrees so 89 degrees the turn on these angles will be a little bit tighter than a square so if you run this it's going to spiral and you actually don't need to be a geometry expert to do this you just experiment and play with different numbers and see what it does but if we did this now with a rainbow check out how it looks [Laughter] come on sophia can i get a sound for that yay you want to do a squiggle so let's try a different angle now so i'm going to do like this angle and see what happens [Laughter] and there's a squiggle going around like that you want to do ropes i see a lot of ropes which is the rope oh that's the rope yeah that weird a lot of people ask for rope right let's pick a different angle for this i'm gonna go like that angle it doesn't look like real rocks so the reason i wanted to show you all this if you see how many lines of code we have here one two three four five lines of code and in fact we don't even need to set the width of this brush anymore so the code that does that in javascript is just those lines of code and if you change the angle and change the pattern you can get all sorts of different drawings it's really not that complicated if you forgot how i did this this whole live stream of this is going to be on youtube as well so you can do it yourself and now what we want to talk about is how you can go learn at home and try doing this at home to make your own beautiful drawings and by the way you don't need to be limited to these five lines of code this is just what i showed today but there's lots and lots of different commands you can use in this area to make interesting stuff so let me get off of the screen share for a second now bill you still with us i'm i'm here that was fantastic i'm excited to go do it myself and create some amazing art through coding all right so uh what i want to ask for folks to do is when you think about uh making these art we're going to give you some uh basically some challenges some takehome questions or basically some takehome work to to try this on your own before we go into that i want to ask are there any more questions akira have there been any questions that came in on the on the message line there have we have a couple for you and a couple for hill so for you hottie someone asked um i have two sixyearold boys and i'm teaching them coding through code.org although sometimes their attention strays and they get bored what advice would you have for somebody learning coding and they may be a bit discouraged um so my first thought is coding is a lot more fun when you make it creative and you know on code.org we have some exercises but we also have some projects so if you're on code.org there's a little create button and if they're bored having them go into the create button into the artist which just takes you to this tool we just showed let's give them a chance to make what they want rather than doing sort of the more schoollike exercises uh but i also would say since they're kids let them take a break as well you know at code.org we're very aware that parents don't want their kids in front of screens the whole time being in front of a screen coding is wonderful because it's creative and educational we also have unplugged activities that kids can do to learn computer science a lot like when we had peeled and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and in fact we're gonna send an email at the end of this to tell you about an unplugged activity that kids can do together or with you that teaches the same kind of concepts but without the screen and it's a little bit more fun because it's more physical and sort of you know in the real world great and for hill how did you first get involved in computer science and what does it look like in your everyday life oh wow so it seems like technology's everywhere um you know i feel like i have to come with me i'll show you something i just i have a sh this shower right and it feels like i have to know how to code like i have to know how to code to turn on the shower so this is like a glimpse into the future i feel like because i couldn't even if i didn't know how to it's like this shower is so confusing to me but that's the way we are we're in a place but i think hottie would tell you i honey aren't we at an inflection point where technology and coding is actually going to get more userfriendly just like using a computer has gotten more userfriendly like like instead of having to learn how to write javascript or instead of having to learn how to do i hate to say this long division we can actually use a calculator is that going to be the same for coding as time kind of goes by that we don't have to learn how to do javascript we can just learn how to put things together and then we could be even more creative because we're not so much spending so much mental energy on learning the actual it's like you learn how to drive a car but you don't necessarily have to be a mechanic to drive a car right absolutely so first of all in case anybody is wondering whether the question that was just asked or the view into hills shower was planned that was definitely not planned i wasn't expecting to see the inside of your shower on our first code break so thank you hill for for walking us into the to the shower for that uh sneak peek of of the the tablet you've got there but yeah absolutely computer programming when my father first learned it involved punching holes into a cardboard piece of paper and whether there was a hole or not a hole was kind of a one or a zero and you shoved that into a computer and that was how you did your computer program and then 10 years later you had to type numbers on a typewriter but those numbers were the computer program and then as time has gone on you have to learn these sort of more sort of english looking like languages like the javascript language i showed earlier and now as you can see this dragging and dropping of blocks you can use those the blockbased programming to do very very complicated stuff and it's getting easier and easier so what's great about computer science is as it gets easier more of the sort of busy work goes out of the way and it's much more about learning how to communicate what it is that you want and in fact you know computer scientists often are very good compu communicators because they practiced communicating what they want or what they need but they're also very literal and very explicit because the more you work on programming a computer it's like programming hill was for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and they want to know exactly and very precisely what's needed but the actual languages are getting easier and easier i started on c which wasn't nearly as easy as python which is one of the most popular programming languages which is just easier to type you're learning python why are you learning python tech class i didn't know that that's pretty awesome all right we're almost out of time so what i want to talk about is the exercises we want to do before next week so we're going to send you all an email with exercises you can make if you aren't signed up for our email list go to code.org make sure this is in front of break camera code.org break we're not going to send you marketing messages you're just going to get a an email with the exercises with the links to where we just were playing ourselves so you can make your own stuff what you're going to get is if you're a beginner you're going to get an exercise that asks you to make this drawing this is really not that hard to do and all of you can do it i am sure if you're more advanced sophie is going to hold up what we want you to do which is that drawing this is a lot harder it's it's a 10 by 10 grid of squares so it's a hundred little squares but this is interesting because what you're going to need to do to make that is come up with an algorithm that's different than what we showed you and as you look at this you have to ask well what's the algorithm for doing this maybe you want to draw 10 lines across and 10 lines going up and down maybe you want to make a row of squares and then come back and make another row of squares maybe you could do sort of a spiral of squares going around in a circle you can come up with your own algorithm and you know we talked about algorithms before like i said there's not a right or wrong way to go about making that square you could do one of many different ways and we want to see what way you come up with after you make your algorithms what we want to do is to have you make your own creative creation so here are examples of things you can make with code that sophia and i made earlier so if you want to hold your examples up it is as you saw very easy to make cool drawings like this on code.org somebody's posting something of this nature roughly every two minutes so everybody in this group can make your own drawing and parents if you're there we want you to share these drawings to social media if you share the social media use the hashtag codebreak so the team at code.org can what you've created and we have over 2 million people who follow code.org on twitter and facebook and on instagram and they would love to see what your students are making for those of you who don't have computers at home we have two options you can do coding on smartphones and we're going to send options in that email for how your students can download an app to learn how to code and also if they don't have a smartphone or you just want to give them less screen time there's an unplugged activity as i said earlier which teaches them how to make algorithms without using a computer all you need is a bunch of paper cups and i'm sure that with this chronovirus quarantine i bet many of you have paper cups and so you can learn how to make an algorithm without writing any code so again if you haven't signed up already sign up at code.org break or just google code break and you'll get to see how that works uh so we're now done with the show i want to say thank you to everybody can we get all the audience on camera so we can say goodbye to all of them at once and can we unmute everybody so everybody can say bye everybody can we end with like a dance party or something sophia you got any music let's end with a little dance party in a dance party so before we close i want to recognize what a unique time we're in with tens of millions of students at home and the entire human race working together to fight a new virus none of us have anything like this i know we're all making the best of us so many groups are using their imaginations to solve old problems in new ways and that's what we're trying to do here to a chance to give you an hour of education and a moment of community in the middle of all our aloneness and i want to give a special thanks to my friend hill harper for being such a great sport and joining us for our first code break are you stuck at home and tired of studying take a code break and goodbye all everybody bye everybody that's not leave meetings um
