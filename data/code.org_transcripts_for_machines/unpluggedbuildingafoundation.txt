Unplugged Activity | Building a Foundation In sand sculpture, you gotta know that failure is part of the program here. You gotta expect it, you gotta plan for it, but if you persist it's just gonna get nothing but better and more exciting for you. That's the name of the game here, just persist and stay with it, and you'll love it. This lesson is called "Building a Foundation" In this lesson, we'll work on a task that's meant to be really difficult. You guys will figure out how to make a structure at least as tall as one of these cups. And it's gotta be strong enough to hold the weight of a book. Nope. Nope. Uhh...nope. There might be times that our creation doesn't work out. Agh! We lost it but let's recover. I have the perfect idea! I need more gumdrops though. There might be times that we get frustrated and want to give up. There might be a lot of those moments. (frustrated) Ugh! I cannot get this! But if we keep on trying, giving it our best shot over and over again, then we're sure to get it before long. Success! Persistence is all about hanging in there when you really want to give up. If you want to create something new and different, there's going to be a lot of failures along the way. The trick to persistence is choosing to keep on going and learn from your failures, instead of quitting because you're frustrated. Frustration actually just means there's something wonderful around the corner. (I wonder if this will work this time) So don't quit before you get to it.
