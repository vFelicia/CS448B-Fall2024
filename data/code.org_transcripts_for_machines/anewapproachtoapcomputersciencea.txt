code.org csa curriculum does what code.org does best equity inclusion and given students and teachers awesome resources to learn computer science having a curriculum that says you belong from day one it's really impactful you don't have to have ever written a single line of java code ever in your life to be able to pick this up and teach it instead of building up all these extra resources code.org has those for you and you can focus on preparing for the class and what your unique students need in your class there's a lot of student choice they can really hone in on who they are and represent it in their projects the most exciting project was definitely the asphalt art project at the very beginning just sparks creativity it really starts to allow students to think of coding in a different light it's very obvious looking at this curriculum that it was designed with culturally responsive teaching in mind it's not just about teaching students java it's also about helping students to see themselves as a computer scientist or as a software engineer and students start to realize that this type of skill that they're doing in their lessons and in their work and then their projects could be transferable to any subject or discipline that they are interested in when we did code reviews i set them up like a board room i had never taught it in csa before to look at other people's code now not only do they look at each other's code they have to comment on each other's code the students after going through the program can see similarities with industry after taking the exam my kids felt very confident my students are engaged they are learning they're making meaning i think it's going to change the face of apcsa
