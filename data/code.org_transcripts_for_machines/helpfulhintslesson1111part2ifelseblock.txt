okay you're almost there i can feel it you already know that you need to move forward to the end of the path and then check to see if there's a flower or a honeycomb underneath the cloud in order to do that you're going to need this if else block if you're at a flower or you know what you can even change this to honeycomb and go the other direction if you're at a honeycomb you'll do what's in this first slot so what do we need to do if we're at a honeycomb that's right make honey else you're going to do what's in this slot so if you're not at a honeycomb that means you're to flower and you need to get nectar that's right so now you're going to move all the way to the end of the path and then you're going to get nectar if there's a flower there you can see that we haven't yet turned right gone to the end of this path this path or this path when all of this is done you'll want to turn right and do it again if you're very clever you'll figure out how to solve this entire problem in nine blocks or less happy coding
