well I think creativity plays a role in almost everything that we do from cooking to making music which is what I do but in computer science you have to have a creative mind computer science it is Art and everybody has a different style and I think that that's a beautiful thing about computer science is that it's flexible as you iterate through code and you start seeing what experiences you're lighting up it is just like a piece of art when you read someone else's code it's almost like reading poetry you try to follow how their mind went about solving a problem no art exists without technology a paintbrush is a piece of technology a typewriter is a type of technology so as we keep coming up with new types of Technology artists are always going to come in and find some new ways to use it in ways that are unexpected there is no creativity without technology and Technology does not exist without creativity
