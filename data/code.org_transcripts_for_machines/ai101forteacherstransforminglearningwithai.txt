foreign hi welcome to session three of the AI 101 for teachers professional learning series in this session we are traveling to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania to chat with Dr Ethan Mullick a professor who teaches Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Dr lilac Mullick who works on interactive pedagogy and AI research they will help us explore how AI can be combined with pedagogy to enhance student learning let's go meet the Molex hi I'm Ethan Malek a professor at Wharton who has been working on how we democratize access to education through tools like games and interactive tools and AI Nami and I'm director of pedagogy of Wharton interactive and I've been working at the intersection of AI and education helping to democratize education for everyone through effective pedagogically sound use of AI and we have been working together on the future of education for a while thinking about how to make education more interactive to work at scale and with the Advent of generative AI we've had a powerful new tool that can really help in the classroom but also carries some risks today we'd like to talk a little bit about the classroom use of AI upside to the downside to give you some examples to work with the first we like to start with our three guiding principles the first is that AI is undetectable there are AI tools detection tools but they are not effective the second principle is that AI is ubiquitous it's everywhere 169 countries have access to Bing chat and you and your students have access to the most powerful AI available the third principle is that AI is transformative it will transform how we live how we work and how we teach and learn foreign not going away but this is probably the worst AI you're ever going to use so if this feels disruptive now I kind of have bad news which is that there isn't a reason to suspect that AI development will not continue and I think people worry a lot about like the far future or who knows how far it is where AI is smarter than humans but even over the next couple years even of the fact of this Academic Year I would expect AI to continue to improve five times ten times we have no idea but if you're not already thinking about these systems what they mean for Education what they mean for you what they mean for your students careers I think we have to think about it because these systems are not going to disappear let me make the very pragmatic case for why you might want to do this for the first part of the pragmatic case is your students will be using this anyway so you have to come to speed I don't think everybody wants to be dragged along this technology no one asked for education to be massively disrupted but it is and unfortunately we've got to figure out a way to get around that all your homework assignments can be done by AI now so you have to think about that and then I think the second thing is the pragmatic argument about how AI can make your life easier as a teacher if you put the hours down you get them back later and if you've worked on a number of prompts to help make lives easier for teachers yeah so one thing you can do prompts like give me a lesson hook prompts like create a lesson plan um or Create a quiz for me so starting to work with your material and the different models can get you give you a really good sense of how the AI Works what is good at what it what it's not good at and so and save you time in the end right so that's where I would be my push to teachers is a you have to and B you're going to want to I think the other important thing is just to try it they're very simple to use they're very intuitive because they're conversational uh you can continue a conversation it feels fairly natural and I think the the key really is experimentation see how it works with you see how it works within your context within your topic that you teach our rule of thumb is you need about 10 hours playing with AI to get what it's good and what its limitations are so I would actually start by suggesting that this that the teacher throw their own assignments into the AI and see what kind of results they get back I would think about asking them uh to ask their students to create an assignment using Ai and then critique that assignment potentially even in class to see for the students can get a sense of what the gaps and abilities of AI are I have a little bit of Freedom as an instructor because I'm teaching college and MBA students entrepreneurship so I have a lot of I have points I want them to make but they also are building things and doing things and ai's absolutely transformed how that works so um my assignments now literally call for students to do at least one impossible thing in class if you can't code you have to write working programs if you have never if you can't do design work you have to create a full graphic design working prototypes that's literally that part of the class so where it used to be right up write a little bit of an essay do a prototype on paper now you have to create a full working product every assignment that they turn in has to be critiqued by at least five famous entrepreneurs through history and they use AI to invoke those there's a pedagogical reason too which is that entrepreneurs tend to be overconfident so you want feedback from different sources so to me it is let me teach 10 times more than I did I used to teach Advanced intermediate entrepreneurship course I can now in the intermediate or basic course get all the way past the advanced material and further so I think we're going to see that shake out more in the future but some of this is about powering a past what we could do before and I think that's exciting as well apart from student tutors as AI assignments teachers can certainly use AI coaches and AI assistants to help students prepare for discussions help students outline help students do research help students get feedback on assignments and just help students develop explanations I think there are Myriad of approaches that are pedagogically sound that teachers can assign to students and watch their work and ask for the back and forth interaction to really see that students are paying attention to and focusing on the material foreign teacher's perspective so because of the ubiquity of AI you've got some choices to make in terms of your AI policies in your class so do you want to permit AI do you want to forbid AI how are you going to enforce these sets of things we're going to assume that you want to use AI to some extent and we'll dive into a little bit of the details here so as a instructor you should know a few things one is there's obviously ongoing ethical debates about Ai and those are complicated debates there are debates over whether or not the AI is trained on the right kind of data about the biases AI might have about the use of AI and the outcomes for student learning and it's worth acknowledging these sets of things but this tool is out there and it is worth thinking about how you want to use it if you decide that that is okay and how you want to communicate that information beyond the initial ethical concerns there's also concerns about how AI actually works so the large language models that power today's AI don't actually have knowledge of the world they're predicting the next word they're predicting the right kinds of sentences or information to give out and as a result they make stuff up they would call hallucinate so there are often errors or mistakes now it's not always clear those errors or mistakes are worse than the errors and mistakes humans would make but you need to be aware that there's going to be those kind of errors and mistakes and then finally you need to think about as a instructor how you're going to be using AI to Aid learning which means being really clear about what you want to accomplish with an AI tool they can be boost for student learning but ai's many possible uses in classroom so do you want to use them to have students generate ideas which I do in my classes and we get better project ideas as a result do you want them to use them as tutors to explain Concepts to them they don't understand do you want these students to get feedback from AI by asking it for questions about work that they're doing do you want to be a writing companion do you wanted to explain why quiz answers might be right or wrong and then once you've decided what to do as an instructor you need to decide what you're going to tell your students AI detectors don't work they just don't work you shouldn't use them and it's worse than them not working because they have a high false positive rate that means they flag things as AI written that aren't AI written and that disproportionately falls on people whose English is a second language this is just not something that we can do and I think trying to close the barn door here after it's been opened and try and detect AI is not the future for responsibility in classrooms the the other thing to note too is that students were using shortcuts in the past it's not that they weren't using Google it's so that they weren't using you know other students essays this was happening in the past but this is a major disruption and I think it does call for a rethinking of how we do essays so thinking a little bit more about the learning goal for an essay or the learning goal for any assignments one of the things that we're noticing as we watch teachers do this is they all feel an obligation to talk about Ai and dive deep into the ethical implications of AI and so on I think that's important but I don't think it needs to be the theme of every class I don't think every class needs to be a discussion about AI just like every class that uses computers doesn't need to be a discussion about computers I think it's important to have that conversation and right now we're all just reacting so it's not clear who's supposed to have that so I totally get teachers wanting to have ai discussions but it's even harder to come up to speed not just on the use of AI but how it works it's you know standards it's ethical implications so I think teachers should feel a little bit of um okayness with experimenting with AI without having to make it the subject of class foreign first is as Ethan mentioned that AI can fabricate that means that any output that the AI gives a student may be made up it may be mistaken it may be very subtly mistaken and so students should be responsible for their own work they should at the very least check sources check any number check any facts that the AI gives them and check them with credible sources the second principle is that the AI is not a person it's easy to imbue the AI with a personality or to feel like you're talking to a person but it's not a person and it doesn't know you the third principle is really to give it a lot of context the AI doesn't know you it doesn't know your context or your experience or your expertise the more context you give it the more useful it'll be for you and the fourth principle is that you're in charge not only should you evaluate and interrogate its output but if it's leading you in a conversation that is no longer useful to to you or if it's stuck in a loop or if you'd like to change the direction of the conversation you should ask feel free to take charge thank you so when we talk about Ai and these generative AI Solutions we tend to talk about large language models and there's actually only a few largescale general purpose large language models there is the models created by openai which are GPT 3.5 or gbt4 gbd 3.5 is the free version that you get through uh through chat CBT and gbt4 is either through the page chat gbt or through Microsoft Bing in creative mode and when we talk about specialized apps almost all of them are using one of these models and providing prompts and other information on top of it I generally think instructors should get familiar with the models themselves because those are the models that are actually producing the answers and you can manipulate them directly that way and learn how they work so if you're trying to buy an offtheshelf solution they're almost only using one of these existing models and then providing some sort of wrapper or other information on top of it and it's often cheaper and more effective and gives you more control to use the foundation models yourself but that's a choice you get to make so when develop helping the prompt we really and for all of our prompts we really look at the science of learning and try to combine that with the power of the AI so for instance a good tutor pushes you for information uh it doesn't just hand it to you a good tutor finds out what you know and builds on that prior knowledge a good tutor will also find out a little bit about you a good tutor also knows that you need lots and varied kinds of examples and analogies and a good tutor knows that the way that you show evidence of Mastery is by being able to explain something in your own words to someone else and give an example of it which is exactly these are exactly the steps and the kinds of questions that we use in the tutor prompt but you'll notice when you look at our prompts that they do things like provide context to the AI as Leo has discussed already the idea that it it asks you who you are and we tell the AI who it is it's an instructor with this kind of setting you'll notice that it also tells it exactly the scientific framework to use this idea of context matters we provide controls we ask it to go step by step through sets of questions to ask sometimes not in these prompts we provide examples of good output and then we test it a lot you can't do prompting without testing and that's one of the great things about testing your expertise it's cheap to do and so you get to experiment a lot and that makes for good prompts and and we should also say we tested not just on one model but on several models so for instance these two prompts we just worked with chat gpt4 they also work with Bing Bing will react a little bit differently and it will um because it's connected to the internet it will also look up citations sometimes they're the right citations sometimes they're not but that is available it may or may not work with some of the other models so you really have to test it I think as an instructor before you give it to your students in the context of the topic that you're teaching to see how it works so this is all very theoretical but I think important so let's let's get practical let's talk about some examples of what AI can do and again this isn't a monolithical thing a AI has many possible uses as we said it was transformative earlier so we're going to show you a couple of prompts that we've created and those will be available to you as well to work with and these are just examples of the ways AI classroom use can work so the first one we want to show you is a prompt that I believe you created that talks about uh feedback that gives proper feedback and one of the really interesting things about the AI side of things is a more sophisticated prompt that takes into account some of the principles we were talking about earlier will result in better outcomes so students will often ask for writing advice from an AI even if you tell them not to do it but they're going to ask for it in a way that's fairly unsophisticated and is going to give them fairly generic sounding work and possibly more mistakes if you give a more elaborate prompt you can get more elaborate answers so in this case could you explain what this prompt does the feedback prompt yes so we combine the principles of good feedback which is feedback that takes into account your prior knowledge or what you already know from the student perspective takes into account who you are your learning level what grade you're in uh whether you're in college or you're a professional and it also takes into account uh the idea that you want to respond to this feedback so it is going to be actionable it's going to be balanced it's going to tell you what's wrong and what you can improve on and what you're doing well and it's going to keep working with you but like any good tutor or coach it won't actually give you the answer it'll push you in that direction ask you to explain ask you to construct your own knowledge and so you can see the prompt hopefully on the screen here uh and uh as a place to work from you don't need to take this as an absolute answer this is something you can play with but let's see it in action so let's get started using this prompt it says that it's a teaching assistant because that's the instructions we gave it and it asks us for our grade level and subject we're studying what should we say so I think we're studying Macbeth and we're in 12th grade in 12th grade okay great okay and so we've told the AI as information it's feeding it into the logic that it's using here and it's asking us about a specific assignment um and it's asking if we have a rubric or other information to work with or what we're hoping to achieve with uh with as much of Rage as possible I don't have a huge amount here so I'll say I have to write an analysis of Macbeth it is graded based on writing style and depth of content and you'll see what it's going is it's asking us questions soliciting information from us which makes it a kind of a good prompt that you might hand a student better than one that is just they're just developing themselves and it's asking about Specific Instructions and as gets to share the assignment uh here is what I have written so far and I have asked the AI to generate a Macbeth essay so here we go I'm just pasting that in and we'll see what it says here and you'll notice it's it's it's working on the information it's saying it's taking time to carefully read through it that's a bit of an illusion it's obviously not taking any extra time but uh it's responding in this method and you'll see it's giving a set of strengths and weaknesses what's great about again using a tutor that you've built or a mentor that you built is that it can give you the kind of feedback that's educationally valuable that ties into pedagogy rather than just students asking make this essay better a nice example of AI working in your favor uh as an educator and not necessarily working against you and undermining the points you're making so you'll notice at the End by the way it gives a question that you for the student's answer so how do you plan to revise your analysis give me a plan on specific changes you're going to make again the kind of thing we would do as an instructor in our classroom soliciting changes or differences so I think you can start to see why a uh tool like this can be really useful when properly applied now let's also talk about one other potential use for ai ai as a tutor what are some of the advantages of disadvantage of that approach so an advantage of this approach is that you're getting students to actually pay attention to the material you're getting them to read over the rubric to read over the purpose of the essay and the audience and to really think through it a disadvantage is that you you certainly can ask the AI to do it for you but if you work with it and if you're given guidelines to work with it it's one way to get feedback that you would then have to evaluate something else that a teacher could do is to ask for the interaction and ask for a reflection about the interactions what about this feedback was good what about this feedback was not as good and again it's a higher order level thinking about your essay and and your process excellent and so I want to show you one other example where the AI acts as a direct instructor and we have a prompt for that as well there are risks associated with asking the AI to be a direct instructor which is that hallucination risk it doesn't know your pedagogy your your your perspective but I find in my classrooms that students are increasingly using the AI as a method of learning so they don't raise their hands as much I'm going to ask them why they're like well I'd rather not show my evenings in class I could ask the AI to explain like I'm five so they're already engaging this Behavior so something like a tutor both does a useful thing of showing you what the future of AI education might look like uh like the way Khan Academy is building AI interactive tutors to work and it also might be a tool your students can use to achieve more in class but you should caveat that with the knowledge that AI tutors are not 100 there yet but let's let's use an example here so this tutor is again trying to take the right kind of format it says hello there I'm your AI tutor and I'm excited to work with you today what do we want to learn about today opportunity cost the concept from economics let's see what happens okay so we're telling the AI where the opportunity cost it's saying it is a key concept of Economics that's even throw a little Emoji here which is cute uh can you ask us about our learning level what level are we at here 11th grade 11th grade now I wouldn't get too tied up on the individual grade it's not amazing at differentiating a 10th grader from 11th grader but this is part of the context in which it's working and so it's not pulling from some sort of universal standards here and it says what do we know about opportunity cost well we know that it has to do with choices has to do with alternative choices that is it and of course the advance one of the advantages of AI is this kind of freeform texted interaction is the real power of education and it's something the AI can fake reasonably well again not as well as a real human instructor yet and you'll notice it's giving us examples and explaining things in different ways which is a powerful thing that AI can do it's very good at breaking things down in different ways but you'll notice that it's now starting to ask questions it's asking us to make choices so one of the things we know from the research on tutoring is you can't just declaim things to people the advantage of tutoring comes from soliciting information making connections and you can see the AI starting to do this and asking us for Connections in our own life the other thing to mention too about the Tudor prompt is that it is not assuming that the student can judge their own learning uh very often you'll see in a tutor prompt that is very simple like explain to me like I'm 10 It'll ask you if you understand something instead here it's not asking you to make a judgment about your own learning which we know is inherently flawed instead it's soliciting as Ethan said soliciting information from you to find out what you know and to help you build on your knowledge and these sorts of subtle differences are what separates using AI in sort of an expert way in a classroom where we know what we want to have happen from just the naive use people are doing I I think that there is an advantage to taking charge of your students AI usage because they're going to be using it anyway and thinking about directing it either by giving them prompts having these discussions and it's a really powerful tool that in the future will greatly boost classroom learning and is not a replacement or threat for students for teachers it is something that we can use to improve the outputs of our work improve student learning make our lives easier while making students lives better and I think that that's a very powerful view of the future and I hope that you at least Embrace that experiment with AI before deciding whether you want to use it or ban it in your classrooms wow there really are so many ways to enhance student learning using AI with AI technology advancing rapidly there will be more and more tools available as with any new tool Educators have a responsibility to ensure they are using ageappropriate tools protecting student privacy and creating spaces for students to critically evaluate the potential of pitfalls of the technology they are using join us in session four ensuring a
