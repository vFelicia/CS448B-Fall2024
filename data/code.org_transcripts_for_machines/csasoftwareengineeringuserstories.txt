my name is andres and i'm a senior director of engineering in the xbox team at microsoft my name is gemma bassoni and i'm the ceo of discover labs my name is pan and i am a software engineer at xbox my name is porva i am a lead product manager at uber when i think about a user story is pretty much the scenario you're trying to solve every time you start a new product is what are your scenarios that's the way i think about the users so think of it as almost like storyboarding what are we using this product for we're creating this feature this is when you start doing all the brainstorming and posting the user describing how it is they use an app or a product my user needs x what are the things that i need to do for each of the stories on code and hardware and experiences to be able to make that happen your user base isn't you right it's all of us they provide the feedback you need to be able to build the experiences what is the story of the user when they go in what do they do first do they click this button first do they walk forward first how do they do these things so you need that feedback in order to design what the experience is going to look like we always listen to our customers what do they want next right and you start all the way from like okay i need to enable the hardware to talking to creators when we write a new feature we want to be sure that they're going to like it that they're going to use it that it will bring value to our platform user scenarios are one of those things that you have you know program managers you have software engineers you have designers you have user experience experts so it's it's a process to make that user scenario just light up just perfectly user interviews are direct interviews where the user is telling you how they use your product so you need to be optimizing for the people that are learning from that experience you always start with how can we make our users happy what are the things that they need and that's where the creative process really starts you start developing scenarios out of that you can actually learn from customers quite a bit and so we get a lot of data continuously and you learn from it so it's like this really dynamic loop of just learning and trying it's important to get ideas from a diverse set of people so i think that's very key to making a successful product it's definitely exciting to finally push a product it takes us months so when we finally push it out we are so excited it's been a long time coming it looks simple but getting to that simplicity is because you are actually doing a lot of this scenario based pieces of coding behind a user story i'm excited about delivering our customers something really cool seeing other people use your product is really really amazing
