welcome to computer science connections coding book covers this module makes connections between Ela and computer science specifically it can introduce reinforce or extend any student learning related to reading novels if you're teaching about fiction nonfiction autobiographies or just want to get your students coding you come to the right place in this module students will learn the basics of sprite lab a blockbased coding platform the main computer science Concepts in this module are Sprites and events a Sprite is something you interact with like a character or an object in a scene each Sprite can have different properties like its costume size and location in coding there are cause and effects relationships we trigger with events an event is an action that tells a specific code segment to run you can use events to make your Sprite speak move across the screen or change with a click of a button for example by assigning a spin right Behavior with a mouse click event we can command this hamburger to spin to the right when it's clicked there are four lessons in this module in lesson one students will learn to code a digital book cover students will learn to add in a title author and background then they will add in Sprites and make the scene interactive the second lesson is an unplug lesson where students will plan out their own book covers students will Begin by reflecting on the books they have read and selecting one to design a book cover for students should imagine they are recommending the book to someone else and peing their interest in read reading it by designing a new interactive cover in lesson three students use the skills they learned in the first lesson to code out the book cover design they brainstormed students will warm up with the Spiral Review of the coding blocks needed then they will be instructed to code their own Sprite lab project step by step to include the title author main characters setting and summary of the book they chose in the final unplug lesson students will share their book covers with one another in a gallery Walk activity students will explore and play test their classmates book cover projects leaving their thoughts and feedback on each other's work the class concludes with a discussion highlighting the role of book covers in conveying information and the uniqueness of individual designs often students try to snap a green event block under the when run block but this will not work the event block stands on its own and any code added to it will run when the event is triggered to test students will need to press run trigger the event they coded and make sure it's working correctly students will encounter bugs if their selections are inconsistent if they experience bugs have students double check that they've selected the correct options if there are inconsistencies in their selection the program will not run as expected in this example the coder wants Wilbur the pig to introduce himself however the coder mistakenly assigned the spider Sprite to say those words because there is no Pig Sprite in the event in the workspace the text will not appear when the pig Sprite is clicked to debug change the spider to the pig Sprite in the say block connected under the event Block in every lesson plan discussion questions are coupled with discussion goals check for understanding and promote student Reflection by incorporating these discussion questions into your teaching this module is aligned with common core Ela and the computer science Teachers Association standards in order to align to Concepts you already teach to help you think of ways to integrate ask yourself how might this module support the content I'm already teaching and should I use this module to introduce reinforce or extend student learning on this topic don't forget about the hide and show feature for each lesson it's best practice to only show the lesson students are currently working on if you do not hide the the following lessons students will be moved to the next lesson automatically before teaching the module complete each coding level on your own you can write your own code as an example for students make sure to review the lesson plans and additional resources code.org provides resources like slides student handouts and helpful hints to help you and your students get started n
