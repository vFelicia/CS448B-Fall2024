hello and welcome my name is Irene Lee I'm the director of Santa Fe Institute's Learning Lab over the past seven years we've developed and refined project guts growing up thinking scientifically project guts is a middle school program that engages students in modeling and simulation of complex adaptive systems we're thrilled to be partnering with code.org to be offering this curriculum for middle school students well computer modeling is a fantastic tool to introduce into middle schools because it's particularly in science because it really takes the student out of the book so for example if you're in a in a town that maybe has issues with water availability like you're suffering through a drought it's one thing to tell a kid you know turn the faucet off while you're brushing your teeth your teeth and they might think well this is really not that much you know it's not having that much of an effect but if they actually model all of the water resources available say in their town and they can see what the effect is of not just one person performing a certain action but the whole town performing it they suddenly come to a better understanding of their role in the system you can explore any problem so thoroughly with a model whereas when you do a laboratory experiment you're only doing like a very small portion of that exploration I'm able to kind of just give them a little bit of information and then watch them grow and watch them expand on that and they're able to share more with their peers and ask more questions and if they need to you know they're doing great at doing some research and going online and finding their own answers and not having to come to the teacher for every little thing I'm there for support but I kind of feel like I'm more in the learning situation and the same with them we're learning together the reason I like it so much is because it teaches I use for computers beyond video games it teaches students how to own a computer instead of just use a computer our curriculum aligns to achieve next generation science standards which are based on a framework for k12 science education developed by the National Research Council and thus they can replace select earth life and physical science units without the need for additional class time as we developed our curriculum we worked closely with current middle school teachers and students it's important to us that our work be teacher and student friendly scientifically rigorous and relevant in diverse communities our modules and lessons also leverage years of our own National Science foundationfunded educational research it is our goal that in addition to deepening students understanding of fundamental science concepts and practice our curriculum increases your students skill and comfort levels in computer science so they feel excited and ready to pursue formal yearlong computer science classes when they attend high school we hope this will be a great learning experience for your students over the years we have seen many students experience the excitement of discovery as they act as young scientists harnessing the power of modeling and simulation to better understand their world most of all we want to thank you the teachers for taking on this new opportunity and committing to develop your own understanding of modern scientific practice have fun we're glad you're part of our program
