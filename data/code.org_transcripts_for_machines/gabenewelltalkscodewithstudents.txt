just a second okay so thank you for joining us for this uh Tech luminary chat this morning with Gabe n from Valve Corporation Gabe needs no introduction he's one of the most powerful men in the computer game business and valve is one of the most impressive uh computer game companies of all time and so I'm gonna turn over to Gabe for a few uh minutes of comments and then we're gonna open up for questions uh Gabe hi everybody uh Thanks James uh good to see you again uh I'm actually ready to just jump directly into Q&A since that that way people get the issues with yeah yeah absolutely let's do that okay then we're gonna start with Tom from Central Middle School so Tom or actually Anam okay you ready can you hear us yeah we hear you uh what was the game that was most interesting and challenging to create um so which game was the most interesting and challenging to create those there actually very different questions sometimes uh very challenging games you don't really learn a lot from them other than not to do that again uh certainly our first game was very interesting uh that was halflife the reason it was interesting is that we came into the field from outside of video games you know my background was in operating systems and productivity software you're tring to learn how to make entertainment products at the same time we were building one we had to learn a lot and the way that we kind of thought about problems didn't map to how lots of people inside of the game industry thought about problems we kind of had to invent some new rules just for our own purposes to so we had some way of making decisions and making tradeoffs uh but every one of them part of how we pick projects to do is you know we're looking for the opportunity to you know create more value for customers and so we're always trying to do you know we really don't like just repeating something we've done before we'd much rather pick problem that we think is kind of moves our our company or our Technologies or our processes forward so we always try to pick a certain amount of Challenge on all of them great all right thank you Gabe and just a reminder for everyone after you ask your question please mute your microphones so we don't get echo in chat and so on okay so the next question is going to be uh from the Met School right before we ask a question go ahead you can go ahead uh can we just request that um Gabe's mic be turned up a little bit if it's not oh I see it's a little hard to hear Gabe okay I don't know maybe you speak into the meh a little bit closer Gabe okay go ahead Keith or go ahead the med school hi um I was I was wondering uh what your biggest obstacle or challenge that you faced and getting to uh where you are today and this is Gabe personally or the company no Gabe gab okay the biggest challenge getting to where you are today um is the volume better now yeah great okay the I mean one of the biggest challenges was uh you know when I was in high school this career didn't even exist it wasn't like There Was You Know video gra development or educational support to that I didn't even really know that I was interested in this field until it kind of came into being so it's hard to be prepared this is going to be even worse for uh you guys because uh the rate of change continues to accelerate uh so the likelihood that the career that you end up having exists or that you the the likelihood that you're going to have to keep discovering new careers uh is a lot greater um that's sort of an interesting thing is to realize uh that you know the future is happening a lot faster than it used to and what its implications are for you personally you know in my grandparents generation people you know expected to work at the same company in the same industry doing more or less the same thing for their entire lives and my grandkids will probably you know find that they could have the risk of becoming technologically out ofd you know between Middle School and High School uh which is just a very different uh relationship to need to have with technological change um the uh you know the actual building of the company uh went you know fairly smoothly in terms of recognizing that the most important thing was were the people who are going to be at the company and finding a group of people who work well together once we had that in place almost all of the other problems tended to just be a question of of time and effort um I hope that gives you you know realistic sense of of the answer rather than sort of the simple answer of you saying oh well you know there was a lot of programming problems on that great thanks Gabe okay the next question is from the Westerly high school so we have the Westerly high school and go ahead uh what shifts do you see happening in technology that uh you are excited about so what shifts do you in technology do you find exciting uh there are sort of two that I think about a lot right now one is that the nature of uh how economies work are going to change fairly substantially over the next uh couple of decades um you know tradition you know an example of of how this is that usually corporations of the methods by which uh uh labor is organized and capital is allocated to some you know kind of old school 20th century terms um and uh the internet in a lot of ways does it a lot better so there's there's this classic paper by a guy named Co called the theory of the firm which tries to answer the question of why don't PR why doesn't pricing automatically cause people's work output to be used efficiently why do you have this other layer of a corporation you know and an employer and how is that possible you know if if the price mechanism is working well why don't people just find me and say hey we'd like you to do this work uh and uh capital is automatically being allocated efficiently to the people who will do something most useful so you've got this capitalist marketbased mechanisms and then you've got this weird thing this giant blob right in the middle of it called the corporation that looks sort of like you know an authoritarian or totalitarian uh uh uh economic thing uh so how does that make sense and the answer the coast would say well here's why it makes sense cost of the recovery and uh reputational value and uh transaction costs uh but he probably he just died recently uh he probably would have said that the internet will replace most of those functions much more efficiently I think that that is pretty accurate and it's going to be a lot of fun to watch how that changes uh I think it mimics what we already see in game development where the audience is the source of as much of the value if not more of the value than the the the the nominal Creator um another area of technology that I'm really interested in is that um our ability to talk directly to people's brains is uh getting better a lot faster and a lot sooner than I think uh certainly that I expected you know that there's research going on right now to uh directly uh generate images inside of people's brains and and uh it's not just hey cool I've got a super high you know I'll plug in to my you know I have a VGA connector on the back of my skull but you know it actually opens up fairly science fictiony uh abilities fairly soon in terms of the subjective experience that you can create for people uh and it's kind of surprising that it's happening uh at the rate that it is uh rather than then you know it used to be fairly comfortable to think oh way off in the future well you know the the fundamental science is being done right now that will enable us to start doing those kinds of things uh but that's pretty interesting and I think they'll obviously have a huge impact on the kinds of experiences we like to have great thanks Gabe okay the next question we have is from the Benway School the Benway School is right right here Benway School hello hi um our question is if you can give any advice for someone who wants to pursue a career in the gaming industry what would it be so uh you know in the past there were always sort of these Gatekeepers you know people who had to give you the ability in order to do something like how do you make a game well you have to get a job in order to make a game you know how do you get an education you have to go to a you have to get admitted to a university and so we've all sort of been trained to think in terms of there's who are the people that I need you know uh to get their blessing in order to do sort of things that really doesn't exist anymore but the best way in our view is to actually just start doing it right now and the key characteristic is to build something that has an audience measure how the audience reacts to what you do make some changes and then iterate that could be you know making Clan logos for your friends or hosting a website where you do funy or interesting reviews of games or building small games themselves so that is you know a super valuable experience whether you go into the automotive industry or into research or anything else that uh iteration or you know with uh a logical set of customers who satisfaction or utilization of what you're building is quantifiable that feeds back into that process you can do that right now and the weird thing is you guys are probably ahead of most you know professors and most vice presidents at at at corporations at understanding that so you haven't actually been corrupted yet and you kind of get it more whether it's how can I get more people to you know be my friend on Facebook or get more people to follow my uh Twitter feed you're sort of used to thinking of it but what you're not used to thinking of it is that's an awesome way to develop yourself professionally so you know just pick something now and you know try to think really hard about how can I here's this number that I'm going to pay attention to how can I make that number as big as possible what are the tradeoffs in the choices you know uh um that's you know the best way to do it sounds really different but saying go to digipen which is a great thing to do or you know work on your programming which of course you should do but it's that experience of having an object an asset a pro a service measuring how well it's doing and then uh uh taking a set of steps that are that create both positive and negative effects in those outcomes and then continuing to adjust your behavior going forward that's the incredibly valuable thing that you can do whether you're an artist a programmer or a researcher or anything else and it's that recognition that your ability to do that today is you know a thousand times better than the best financed company from 20 years ago right you have so many you have the way better tools than you know General Motors did you know you know at the beginning of the dotcom era great thank you Gabe okay the next question is from Sil Prairie High School uh let's find John from silk Prairie High School that's right no no no right there okay hi can you hear us y we hear you all right we have Nick and he's gonna be asking a question about education what exper what educational experien has best prepared you for the work that you do now uh the uh the most valuable educational experience for me was sort of a nontraditional one I started um uh I was going to University and went out to visit my brother he just started at this new software company was the third largest software company on the east side of Lake Washington and uh I was going out to visit him uh and all of a sudden he was working all the time so rather than hanging out with me and you know seeing the Space Needle I was just hanging out with him at work and uh Steve Balmer who's currently the president got mad that I was distracting him and said well if you're going to be spending all your time hanging out here you need to do something useful uh those first three months when I was working with people like Tom Corbett and Neil conen and Steve Wood were probably the most intense and valuable educational experience I've ever had they sort of showed me how to be a software a professional software developer you know it was an incredibly fast and really significant set of lessons that I that I learned uh I'm not sure how anybody else can replicate that other than to say that actually trying to do what you want to do with people who are already really really good at it is one of the most powerful educational experiences you can have um not to bang on Harvard but I learned more in in three months uh with with those guys at Microsoft than I did the entire uh time I I was at Harvard at Harvard I learned how to drink beer while doing a headstand in the snow so uh which you know it's a useful skill that uh not nearly as useful as how to actually develop software and and think about how small group and large group processes uh affect outc great thank you Gabe okay and next up we have horis man School and school here Horman school and my old Alum I should say so hor man wrong school I'm sorry Hi um so we're hor man School in New York and this is seventh grade I'm jul how do programmers at Val work in teams to develop products I don't know if you caught that g the question is how do programmers work in teams ADV valve to create products uh so what are the horest man what's your mascot The Horseman fighting weasles the horeman it's a lion right a lion a lion okay yes go lion um the uh so uh so the a lot of times the question comes down to um okay do you if people know what a prediction Market is basically recognizes there's a bunch of information contained in transactions of significance so uh it's just a really useful way of uh doing information Discovery particularly around price or other things which are proxies for Price internally the one thing that we never that we try to avoid at all costs is steering how people spend their time and this sounds like exactly the opposite of what most companies do where uh directing other people's activities is sort of the defining characteristic of management so we seem to be saying that's that's actually the only way you can really damage the productivity of these people so what we say is you have a limited amount of time that's the that's the scarcest resource we have every decision you make with your time is a vote about what the company's priority should be so the question you should ask as a programmer is uh what's the best way for me to spend my time right now that creates value for our customers not what is my boss going to measure me against as as a yard stick so we tell people that they're the ones who are making the decision uh and that it's all about them coming up with the their best estimate of uh of how they can create value for our customers now that sounds kind of chaotic but it actually turns out to be a really good way of for us of coordinating people's activity you know so an engineer will be sitting there saying I see that these other guys are working on this I actually know how to solve that problem and even though I don't necessarily understand the bigger picture of what they're doing I can see that I can create a lot of value right now by uh taking what I've learned in matchmaking in this game and applying it in matchmaking on their game um uh the the there's no uh we tend to embed a lot of processes into tools so the tools tend to iterate over time as we think about different ways of improving productivity so when you think of how builds get made or uh code gets checked in and out of the projects uh we try to build support make certain kinds of data highly visible inside of the organization in terms of uh making it easy to spot problems as as soon as uh possible um but at the end of the day we're really highly dependent on the individual programmers sense of what they should be doing on and how to be as productive uh in achieving that as possible the first engineering problem they have is to engineer their own daily workflow thank you Gabe and by the way to all the students gab's giving was essentially a master's level a lot of his answers here are excellent and I encourage you to go back and watch his video a few times because I think there's a lot of really valuable information in here that may be a little bit tough to parse uh the first time you're hearing it but this is this is thank you gab this is excellent our next question is from Tommy uh at the Usher ker Elementary School okay go ahead good morning Mr gab new on behalf of Usha K Elementary School we would like to say thank you for taking time to talk to us and impart your knowledge about cing and computer program we believe that reading and writing codes will prepare us to be successful in the 21st century here at Ooa Elementary our model is work hard get sm with no excuses our future goal is to transition from being users and consumers to Innovative thinkers and creators with that being said can you describe free Elementary level web based programs platforms and organization gr that can that can even out playing fields for the students regardless of their social economic status to learn how to create feature apps video gaming and program programs and okay thank you very much did you c a question yeah I think I did so um here's an example where there sort of needs to be a dialogue between the parents and the teachers and the students so some places uh hate it when the students are texting in class so you say oh the students really distracted they're making noise they're whatever but the reality is that if you look at the volume of text production that kids who are texting each other are actually writing a huge amount more than kids in my generation were writing that there the amount of writing production they do was spectacular and that just the practice of writing makes a much better writer sooner so on the one hand you have something that looks like it's the enemy of Education having a phone and texting your friends and sending them pictures of cats doing making funny noises but when you actually say well let's just step back and rather than saying uh let's just you know say that that's bad maybe it's actually an incredibly good thing when you really look at what those outcomes are so uh that's where the kids and the teachers uh and the parents need to actually have that conversation of is this really a bad idea so my kids uh like to play video games and you know even though I'm into video game business I go like okay come on you're you know you need to do some you need to be outside or you know uh go read a book or something like that on the other hand I'll be sitting there and I'll be listening to them playing a video game and they're shouting at other people in Russian and German uh so the reality is even though they don't think they're learning anything playing any video games they're actually picking up a bunch of foreign language skills and they're connecting with uh people all over all over the world you know people that uh my generation would have never even known existed they're casually learning multiple language vocabularies in the context of these of these games so uh the real thing I'd say is rather than picking a b or c and saying that those are the right things is that the parents and the teachers and the students need to have a really thoughtful conversation about what are the things the students are actually ahead of both parents and the teachers in terms of knowing what it is that's really cool and what needs to happen is to have a conversation about how that can be as beneficial to all the students as possible while mitigating you know any of the potential down side so ra I would say to you guys you guys actually probably know better than anybody else what are the most useful pieces of technology to use right now is it Snapchat is it Facebook is it Instagram I mean is to think about those things and try to come up with an educational friendly or an educationally oriented way of using that uh and that's not going to stop there's going to be more and more of these things coming all the time and you guys are actually going to be a lot smarter and a lot more comfortable with those Technologies as long as you're using them on a regular basis than the teachers and the parents so kids are really going to need to show some leadership in terms of uh sort of being patient with the parents and teachers but also being to kind of engaged around that issue great thank you Gabe okay we have our last question now is from East Hill Elementary School East Hill Elementary School okay turn on your microphone hear you hi my name is leis and we are the East blaz dis from Kamp Washington my question is is there a way for me to start making my own video game well there are lots of ways to make your own video game and there are lots of tools uh to help you do that um you know uh you know there's Minecraft s that's out there there's uh Gary's mod um more and more games are putting in uh user generated content like uh scheme Workshop features so you know the main thing is to pick a game you like and then look for ways uh to extend that that way you sort of can work within a framework that you already understand or an art direction or uh an engine design and then once you've done that then start to build up out and use tool kits like uh Unity or the source engine uh to to build more ambitious uh projects um also the line is sort of blurring between uh what the different forms of creation are uh in our own mind for example we look at um professional game players the sort of our collaborators and creating the the overall video game experience so like if you really like watching gendi or Mushi play uh go to or Sing Sing uh in a sense they're creating you know television serialized television and we think really hard about how to how to make that happen uh so don't dismiss you know just taking a video camera and pointing it to yourself and talking about what you like as a stepping stone towards being in content uh creation business and if you find something's a little frustrating or repetitive or difficult that's an opportunity to write some codes to make that process simpler uh so the easiest thing to do is just to pick something you really like and enjoy and think about how to make it more fun for you and for your friends and all of a sudden you'll discover you know like Gary's Mod or Minecraft that you have sort of stepped into building you know you games that millions of people are playing all over the world all right well thank you then that completes all of our questions so uh let's hear a round of applause for Gabe n everyone for gabes you can unmute your microphones now Round of Applause in the same way that I've said to you that it's useful to get feedback for me I do this and I try to think of how to do it better next time just like I told you guys so my email is Gaben Gaben Val valv software.com and if you guys could give me feedback uh sort of saying this is what you like this is what you didn't like this made sense this other thing this sounded completely incomprehensible that would be useful for me because it's kind of a twoway street the next time I do this I'd like to be better at it and you guys can help me get better at it by giving me feedback all right great thank you very much Gabe with that we're gonna stop the broadcast thanks everyone byebye
