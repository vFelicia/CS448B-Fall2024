hey folks today we're going to be talking about how to use the ice cream survey in lessons 11 and 12 just to help you with some of the logistical challenges here we go in the lesson plan there is an ice cream survey i'm clicking that now and when you click on it it's going to ask you if you want to make a copy in your own google drive so you're going to need a google account to use this if you click make a copy now you're going to have your own copy of the survey that you own so it won't be the one that anyone else anyone else's classroom uses in fact if you want you can go up to the top corner and change the name so i'll call it my copy great you're going to need to share this with your students so click the send button in the top right corner and you're going to be able to get a link through this menu that you can share with your students through an email or an lms this is going to bring them to the actual survey just to show you what that looks like if you add a new tab they'll actually be looking at the survey and they'll be able to take it going back to your copy as the teacher you're going to have a second tab called responses and there you're going to be able to see responses as they come in i'm going to click this create spreadsheet button and that's going to make another doc that holds all the responses to the survey this is what students are actually going to need in lesson 12 so they can analyze the data and you're going to need to share it with students as well in order to do this you're going to need to make this a document that they have access to so you're going to need to click the share link in the top right corner and in the share settings the advanced settings here i'm just going to change it so that anyone with the link can view now this link here is one that i can share with my students so that they can go in and analyze the data that's all there is to it
