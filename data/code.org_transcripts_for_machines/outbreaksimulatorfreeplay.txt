Great work scientists, we noticed that when there are more monsters on the screen, the virus spreads faster. We also noticed that when the monsters are masked, the risk of transmission goes down. And we observed that the fastest way to prevent the spread of the virus is to get all monsters vaccinated. The print block displays text on the screen while your simulation runs. Use it to share a recommendation to keep all the monsters healthy when a virus comes to town. You can also share your work with friends and family by clicking the share button. You've just made your very own public health simulation using computer science. I hope you had fun and I can't wait to see what you do next.
