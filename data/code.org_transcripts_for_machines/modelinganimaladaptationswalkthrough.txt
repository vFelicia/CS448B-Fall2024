welcome to computer science connections modeling animal adaptations this module makes connections between science and computer science specifically it can introduce reinforce or extend any student learning related to animal adaptation if you're teaching about Behavior cause and effect or just want to get your students coding you've come to the right place in this module students will use Sprite lab a blockbased programming platform to code an eventbased cause and effect model to demonstrate how species Survive by adapting to their environment over time the main computer science Concepts in this module are Sprites events and behaviors a Sprite is something you interact with like a character or an object in a scene each Sprite can have different properties like its costume size and location in coding there are cause and effect relationships we trigger with events an event is an action that tells a specific chunk of code to run events allow us to change our programs in real time for example by assigning a spin right Behavior with a mouse click event we can command this hamburger to spin to the the right when it is clicked behaviors are actions that happen over and over while the program runs students will use behaviors in computer science to represent animal survival behaviors they will give their Sprites a set of instructions to execute over and over like an animation there are three lessons in this module in lesson one students explore examples of evolution adaptation migration natural selection and survival in groups in lesson two students will Model Behavior adaptations by using events to trigger multiple behaviors as well as using new properties like a Sprite size and speed in the third and final lesson students learn how to edit animal behavior in code students will make a prediction about a fox's mystery Behavior use the edit button to debug different animal parameters like speed and direction to complete the lesson students will choose an environmental change scenario use their own creative code to model a new and unique animal adaptation and share their behaviors with their peers a student might might encounter a bug if their Sprite costume selections are inconsistent have students double check that they've selected the correct costume to call the intended Sprite in this example the coder wants the parrot Sprite to dance when the program is run however the coder mistakenly assigned the eagle Sprite to dance because there is no Eagle in the play Space users will not be able to see any Sprite dance to debug change the eagle Sprite to the parrot right in the block often students try to snap a green event block under the win run block but this will not work the event block stands on its own and any code added to it will run when the event is triggered encourage students to frequently test their code they will need to press run then use the play Space to trigger the event it can be easy for students on laptops to miss part of the instructions because the panels are small reminding them to expand the instruction panel down will allow students to see all of the steps if a student gets confused after making several changes in their code it is easy to reset the level and start blocks just click version history and then start over to reset just the level there on in every lesson plan discussion questions are coupled with discussion goals check for understanding and promote student Reflection by incorporating these discussion questions into your teaching review the concepts of adaptations camouflage Evolution and migration with with your students use the provided slideshow to introduce these Concepts and teach the vocabulary within the context of the lesson this module is aligned with ngss and the computer science Teachers Association standards in order to align to the concepts you already teach to help you think of ways to integrate ask yourself how might this module support the content I'm already teaching and should I use this module to introduce reinforce or extend student learning on this topic don't forget about the hide and show feature for each lesson it's best practice to only show the lesson students are currently working on if you do not hide the following lessons students will be moved to the next lesson automatically before teaching the module complete each coding level on your own you can write your own code as an example for students make sure to review the lesson plans and additional resources code.org provides resources like slides student handouts and helpful hints to help you and your students get started
