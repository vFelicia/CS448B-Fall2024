good morning everyone i am so excited to be with you this morning my name is alexis minoka harrigan i work at code.org and i am so thrilled to be here with my colleagues maureen sturgeon and aaron bond for one of our several uh one of our many class chats that we're doing for our cs journey series um i want to get us started with some tough hitting questions right from the beginning but before i do um anybody who has questions or is tuning in from either their classroom or their office or their home please go ahead and feel free to put questions in the chat we'll try to get to as many of them as possible throughout today's discussion um but i want to start with an icebreaker and this morning i was chatting with some members of my team and we found out there's this company that exists that actually will carve people's faces and heads into blocks of cheese so my question for you is if you could have in your kitchen on your counter someone's head anybody's anybody's had anybody's face carved into a block of cheese knowing that you would eventually have to eat part of it whose head would you want sitting on your kitchen counter as a block of cheese i'll start with maureen all right that's a hilarious question um off the top of my head i'd probably say my roommate brian because i think it would be quite the shock for him to come into the kitchen and discover that he is a block of cheese so uh that's probably who i'd pick that's great aaron how about you this is so silly um i think i would go with my grandfather um because he has a very strange sense of humor he's from wisconsin so it would be fitting um and i would just like having him in my kitchen all the time that's great thank you both for humoring me with that fun and silly question this morning uh so let's dive into the first question i would love for you to eat yourselves share what your role is currently and how you got to the place you're at and we'll go ahead and start with maureen cool so hi i'm maureen i am a software engineer at code.org and let me tell you a little bit about my journey to become a software engineer um okay so let's go all the way back um in middle and high school i really did not know what i wanted to do i thought you know maybe i'll be an engineer maybe i'll do something in like the sciences um i probably want to go to college but i really didn't know what i wanted to do so i got into college and i started taking some classes a variety of classes i took on some chemistry classes some general requirements that i needed to take for my university i worked in the engineering department the first year and i took some math classes and what i discovered was uh quarter after quarter i kept wanting to take more math classes because my professor was just super awesome they were really fun it was a lot more fun than like high school math or other math classes i'd taken in the past it was super engaging and challenging in a way i hadn't experienced before and so about a year and a half two years in i was like you know what i'm going to study math like this is fun i want to keep taking math classes this is what i'm going to study followed by a moment of panic of like whoa what do you do with a math degree like who studies math that seems a little bit crazy and so i got a little stressed out about you know what kind of job am i gonna have by studying math um so i ended up chatting with a professor and said it was a math professor and i said hey i want to study math but like i don't know what i would do with a math degree and he was super nice and was like okay well let me connect you with some of my old students who have graduated with a math degree and you can talk to them about what they're doing so i connected with a few different people a lot of them had like a data analysis type jobs and i got a little bit more of an idea of what they do day to day and then the other people that i talked to were like my friends and the other students in my major and was like hey you know what are you guys gonna do with this major like what are your plans after school and what i discovered is a lot of those people in my classes were also taking computer science classes and at that time in college i'd never taken a computer science class that wasn't offered at my high school i really didn't know what computer science was but i was like you know what if they can do it i can do it so i started taking computer science classes and i loved them but this was kind of late into my college i was probably about 21 when i took my first computer science class and so i didn't have time to do an entire computer science major so i ended up graduating um with a degree in math and a minor in computer science and i popped out into the real world and still didn't know what i wanted to do so i had an internship out of college um doing data analysis at a credit union and i really didn't enjoy that internship i didn't like the cubicle life i didn't like getting dressed up in uncomfortable clothing every day the time went by really slow i thought it was boring it wasn't very engaging and i thought you know this isn't making me happy i gotta find something else i really miss the computer science like the programming that i was doing in school i wonder if i can get a job programming but i only have a minor so i'll probably have to look for a junior or internship position so i started studying really hard this little guy in the blue with the blue faces me panicking trying to study um to get my foot in the door somewhere and luckily i had a friend from school who already had a job and a company reached out to her and said hey we have a software engineering internship and she's like oh i already have a job but my friend is looking for a job and so i interviewed for that internship that software engineering internship and got that internship and that was my foot in the door and i totally loved it it was like really cool office space i could wear whatever i wanted it was very relaxed it was really fun it was engaging the days went by really quickly and that sort of led me to where i am today it's uh really great to hear how people end up in their current roles both at code.org but particularly in the software field as well erin would love to ask you the same question who are you how did you get to where you are and what are you doing now sure um so i'm erin bond i'm also a software engineer at code.org i'm actually on the same team as maureen but have a very different path um to getting there so i'll share my screen and tell you a little bit about my journey um in middle school i really loved two things i loved reading and i loved dissecting things um my eighth grade science class had an award for most enthusiastic dissector and i wanted and i just thought it was fun and interesting to look inside of things and to see how how they worked and so from there i thought i should be a doctor so my plan was i was going to be meredith gray i was going to get to wear scrubs i was going to go leverage this background in sciences that i had and um made it to college and decided to major in neuroscience with that intent um to go be a physician until i got a summer internship at the science center and realized that i loved interacting with kids and explaining science to people and seeing that wonder and spark um in them and so i thought okay this is fine this is fine i like kids i'll just be a pediatrician but when i went back to my junior year i took an education course just as a humanities requirement that had a fuel service component where i was in schools elementary schools um working with students uh in order to get credit for this class i really really liked it and so after some hard thinking i sort of hummed and had and really i wasn't totally sure what i wanted to do but decided that i would try teaching so i taught elementary school um for a few years i had first and second graders which was really fun i even got to have my face on a cake one year for end of the year celebration this is my teaching team um and it was great but for me it was very exhausting um because i was with other people all day every day and 30 different small humans needed my attention i just found out that it was really wearing out my energy stores i was just tired um and so i decided that i instead was going to switch to work oneonone with students um so i started a tutoring company this is me on my scooter that i drove all around the city meeting with families and students helping folks who were struggling with reading and writing and um sort of staying organized and focused in school and what i liked about it was that oneonone connection and i liked helping people who were having the roughest time in school and i liked finding ways to motivate students but i had one particular student who was not motivated not interested really obstinate didn't did not want to hang out with me and so we brokered a deal and i said look when you have a cooperative minute with me if you get your stuff done for the amount of time that we have to do then you um can have screen time and he just became a totally different student and so i had to ask him what are you doing on your screen that you love so much and he told me about this game called lightbot i don't know if any of you have ever played it you get a little robot to go through a maze and jump on these squares i started playing it all of a sudden it was three o'clock in the morning and i wanted to solve the last level and i was super into it um and so i understood like why is this so engaging and i learned more and more about this game and found out that it teaches introductory computer programming concepts and it kind of blew my mind i had never considered computer science it wasn't offered at my high school it wasn't offered at my college i just never been exposed to that possibility um and once i did i wanted more of it i wanted that problem solving that puzzle that sort of engagement and so learned to code as a grownup i didn't write my first line of code until i was 28 years old at an organization called ada developers academy which is for folks who are interested in changing careers and as part of that got an internship at code.org um and have been there ever since so it's been about four and a half years um so far no one has put my face on a cake but i didn't get this cute picture from a school visit uh where we were beta testing some new tools and it's just been a really really interesting fun um satisfying blend of education and technology to be here at code code.org building tools for teachers and students in a way that suits how my brain works thank you both so much those were great responses and very different journeys to get to where you are i would love to hear a little bit about what george day looks like for you um i obviously i'm not a software engineer i said on our advocacy team where i get to talk to policymakers and try to pass computer science education policies i would love to hear what does a typical day look like for a software engineer at code.org uh maureen i will throw this question to you awesome all right i created a little diagram of what i think my typical day looks like so let me see all right so i would say actually the majority of my time is actually spent um researching and reading this might be googling for how other people have solved problems online or how to write logic in a specific coding language or something like that it's also i spend a lot of time reading our code base you know we have a really big code base there's a lot of code and in order to write new code and add features you kind of need to understand the whole picture you need to understand how that code is going to fit in with the code that already exists so i spend a lot of time researching and reading and then i spend a little bit of time like 10 of my time reviewing code it's a peer review kind of like you would do in school when you're reviewing each other's papers in english or something like that um we review each other's code and try to catch errors and for um for each other and then about 30 of my time is spent um actually writing code for the features that i'm building um then we got this little chunk up here about 15 of my time is spent in meetings where we plan and what we're going to build how we're going to build it how long it's going to take stuff like that and then i have 10 of my time is spent um collaborating with my coworkers maybe we're trying to solve a hard problem together or coding together or something like that so i kind of split this pie up into a blue section and a green section because i wanted to show that actually most of my day is spent working independently which works really well for me as an introvert i love you know collaborating with other people but it makes me really tired so i really like having this independent working time and then you know it's nice to be able to collaborate with other people every once in a while too thanks maureen and as a reminder for those who are tuning in from classrooms around the us please feel free to pop a question into the chat under the q a feature and we would love to get to your questions while we wait for those questions to come in erin i'd love to hear from you we heard a little bit things that you enjoy doing outside of your work day outside of work i love um being outside i have a toddler so we spend a lot of time going on little hikes and going to the farm and playing at playgrounds i also love scuba diving my husband's a marine biologist and so we spend a lot of time going on adventures when we can and looking at tide pools um and in general i also love writing so that passion that i had early on of reading has now stayed with me and it's something that i do uh outside of work as well anything interesting that you have written in the last year or two i write mostly picture books so i used to write stories when i was teaching uh to help sort of reinforce concepts or teach ideas and then have sense just do it for fun that's great thank you um one of the questions that came in from ann gorman are you happy with your career choices and i'll pose this to both of you aaron since we're we're with you let's just stick with you how are are you happy with your career choices i am i think one of the things that i always been mindful about as i'm thinking about my career is how it fits in with the rest of my life i knew that i wasn't going to be the kind of person who wanted to do my job all day every day and have it be the only thing that existed as part of my identity and so every choice that i have made has been one where i get to help people in some way i get to have a life that feels wellrounded and i get to challenge myself to learn and grow and so those are three criteria and so if you make your choices based on your values i think it's hard not to be happy with what you end up with you completely agree maureen knowing that your boss is probably watching are you happy with your career choice i am so happy with my career choice it's funny i like if you would have asked me what i was going to be you know 10 years ago i wouldn't i don't even know what computer science was so this is a really kind of unexpected path for me um but i i think a lot about like just how grateful i am to have found a career where i really do love what i do day to day i'm like super engaged um i'm just super grateful to have found the career that i've found i'd love to stick with you for the next question as well what are some of the challenges you faced along the way and how have you approached overcoming some of those challenges to get where you are today definitely um you know like my journey sort of showed for a long time i didn't know what i wanted to do and there was a lot of like trial and error to get through that um i think also getting my foot in the door with computer science was hard you have to have a lot of persistence to learn computer science and then also to get a job in computer science and you know i've had interviews that the interviews are hard and i've had interviews i haven't passed and you take a moment and you're like is this the right career path for me you know but you got to realize that when something doesn't work out it's just redirecting you to something better and to keep going for it thanks maureen uh one of the questions in one of the classrooms was asking another student is curious if most of your time in front of a computer and do you like spending most of your time in front of a computer um aaron we'd love to hear from you i have mixed feelings about this um i spend a lot of time you can see the corner of a cork board over there i've got a white board over here so in addition to spending time at the computer i'm also spending time mapping out how systems work or how i want things to fit together or what my plan for what i'm going to code is going to be i also do a lot of my best thinking when i'm out and walking so if i'm sort of mulling over a problem i might do that while i'm taking a stroll around my neighborhood um so yes and no i mean my actual coding time is clearly spent sitting in front of a screen but a lot of my thinking and planning and organizing and even some of my collaborating happens away from a screen aaron maureen same question are you in front of a computer all day long and do you enjoy that yeah this is a great question because you know i don't really enjoy the sitting in front of a screen part of my job but i feel that during the day i'm so engaged by problem solving that i don't you know my mind is somewhere else i'm imagining like all the potential solutions i'm super engaged so the sitting in front of a screen is sort of not a big deal i guess um and then of course there's things that you can do during the day you can go out take a walk you can get a standing desk where you're standing up um there's a lot and you know after work i'm not at the computer anymore so there's lots of ways to balance it thank you erin i'm curious what is a project that you're working on right now or a project you've worked on recently that you're really proud of or most proud of oh i'm excited to tell you i'll share my screen again um i recently worked on a project to teach ai and machine learning to students um and so oh gosh hang on um and so the way that it worked is for the first time code.org was teaching uh we taught computer science with um we did ai for oceans and so after that we decided that we wanted to expand more i'll just tell you about it um we wanted to expand more into uh ai and machine learning and so we decided to build out a middle school unit i don't know if any of you have done it where you can train a machine learning model and then use it in an app lab project to get predictions back and it was really exciting for me to work on because i didn't know anything about ar machine learning before i started this project and i also got to collaborate very closely with the curriculum team which with my background in education was very very fun for me um so it was a brand new space and i had a lot of collaboration and um we got to be very creative and so that was a really exciting project for me um you should go try it out it's in the csd curriculum uh yeah thanks erin we uh at code.org all got um little and my um i have two young children and they both love cuddling with a little ai robot and a great way for them to interact sort of in real life but then also um so we have another question from uh someone else on the chat uh marquez uh garrett as a software engineer how much time is spent in office with other people versus at home and remotely now this is tough given covet times but um maybe precoveted and postcovered um how much time is spent at home versus versus remote and how are you interacting with folks in an office uh let's go with maureen cool um well i actually started at code.org less than a year ago so i started remote i've been remote the whole time but um at a previous job i was fulltime in the office so i was in the office you know five days a week and i i thought that was a lot of fun because you get to like you know swivel your chair around hang out with your coworkers and problem solve at your desk and usually the tech tech company offices are really fun there's like snacks and games and stuff like that um but there's pros and cons like i i like working at home you get to sleep in a little later which i like um and you have a little bit more freedom if you need to like do laundry during the day or you want to you know go out and grab lunch or something like that it gives you a little bit more freedom thanks maureen i really do like at least once a day taking a call over the phone and just walking around my neighborhood it's a nice way to get out and still be collaborative erin what about you um thinking kind of precovered post covid how do you um enjoy or dislike sort of the balance between office i used to be in an office um and then moved during the pandemic so now that i am fully remote i like being remote um i was doing it one or two days a week to begin with um and i find that it's nice to be able to collaborate with coworkers in person but i can get what i need to get done um from home fairly easily we also get together a few times a year as a whole organization so you have this really fun bonding time that's primarily social activities and so to have a little bit of a balance of spending time in person but mostly at home works really well for me thank you second to last question for maureen and then the last question will go to both of you um actually if we have time i want to ask both of you what has been in your and i'm going to say at code.org so maureen will start with you oh sorry you cut out for a moment can you repeat the question no what is the heart what was the hardest code for you to write oh oh my gosh this is going to be a hard one um you know i'll just i'll just think to some code that i had to write recently how about that um there's a lot of hard code that i've had to write but recently i was trying to uh solve a problem where it was sort of a data problem um there was a bug caused because we were needing a little bit more data in one of our databases um so there was already a bunch of existing data and then we needed to fill it in with a new column of some information to kind of complete the picture so i had to write a script that would run and fill in this missing information and i had to determine what is the right missing information for each of these rows in the database and that was that took me some time and also because our database table was really big there was like over 300 million rows you know how am i going to fill in all of this data and do it in an efficient way and um do it correctly so that you know there wasn't any sort of bug that was created on the website so that nobody even notices that the data was filled in um so that was a challenge that i was working on recently thanks maureen and aaron i'm going to switch it up on you um we actually just got another great question again from ann gorman's class you didn't major in computer science do you wish you had majored in computer science i like this question my answer is no but um it is because i think for me personally i am interested in intersections right like how does neuroscience overlap with education how does education overlap with technology what are the places where ideas sort of cross and fuse together because i think those are the most interesting spaces for me to work in and so having this really varied background allows me to come to computer science and to the job that i'm doing now in a way that gives me skills and a perspective that's different than other software engineers and through that diversity of thought we then come to better solutions i think there's a ton of value in majoring in computer science and if you're interested in that absolutely go for it you shouldn't be deterred because you think it's hard or scary or not for you but also think about what are my other ideas and interests and curiosities and how can i fuse them together whatever they may be because i think that's where you're going to find the most interesting satisfying places to work or things to study thanks erin and the final question for both of you and i would ask that you try to keep it to 30 seconds or less what are some of the next steps that students can take that are tuning in if they're interested in pursuing similar career paths if they want to be a software engineer that's what they start doing now maureen i'll start with you sorry um i would say start taking some classes look at what sorts of options there are at your school or maybe outside of your school and explore some options i would say um listen to what engages you think about like that thing where you're like oh that's kind of interesting listen to that because that'll lead you in a direction to do something that you really enjoy um and then also ask for help like you're there are people around you that want to help you there are teachers there are parents there are friends um you know sometimes reaching out and being like how can you help me get to this goal um you'll you'll get some surprising help thanks maureen how about you aaron i think the other thing that you can do is start cataloging what your strengths are so not just what you're interested in but what are you good at how do you leverage them what could that look like for you um ask a lot of questions be open be curious um i think maureen said like i didn't even know it was an option 10 years ago i was super similar like i didn't you would ask me i would not have say said that i was going to be a software engineer um so be open to possibilities in different paths and um also yeah just follow those little tendrils of ideas i think that's where you're going to find what suits you thank you both so much and thank you both for being with me here today and all of the folks that tuned in from all over the u.s and around the world i saw we had some folks internationally uh thanks for answering these questions and i hope that the students who are tuning in um hopefully have one more option to consider in their career path and please tune in to future cs journeys class chats and with that i will go ahead and close have a great day
