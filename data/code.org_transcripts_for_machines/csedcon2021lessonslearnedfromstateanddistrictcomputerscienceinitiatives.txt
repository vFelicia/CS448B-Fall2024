so do do so so foreign do so so so do good morning this session will begin in five minutes thank you do so do so so do we're celebrating computer science education week all across the 720 square miles that encompasses la unified it's a jackson product so my students were trying to figure out a way to help design for those further away from power we were making a prototype so that we could help other students with autism express themselves so some of them had designed a sweater where he pressed the finger if you moved it it said hi my name is another one said i'm hungry for me it's like a whole new world so i feel grateful to have access to those things because i can really do a lot more to help others they're integrating language arts they're integrating art they're integrating music and so to put all of that together to something for good i feel that coding is a way to help everybody no matter who they are so when you do an event like today there's a couple of things that are happening one you're inviting the whole school to the table if you have new students at the school they've maybe never engaged in computer science ever before they have an opportunity to experience that today the folks that came today are community stakeholders at our school i wanted them to know this is what you've been investing in this is what you've been partnering with us in those principals that come in and say we've only been doing this for three or four months this can be at your school too in just a short period of time it's an important skill because you don't only learn how to code but you also learn about life skills so teamwork patience double checking so even though you might not think about using coding as your future career those skills that you have you can take them with you anywhere and any job that you decide to do because you're always working with people around you it's got a lot of design principles in it and logical thinking and that's what really computer science is and it's now critical across all fields and all careers ways we communicate everything for so long computer science was not really fully present in schools with high numbers of kids of color and lowincome students so in la unified the demographics of our students is 73 latino however the private industry in terms of computer science does not reflect that whatsoever so if we were able to really provide that opportunity for access we would also be having an impact on the industry and so this computer science movement is really an equity movement that's what the work is about providing the opportunities for students who wouldn't have it otherwise and really opening up the field for everyone what we're seeing here is only one of the many initiatives that the instructional technology initiative is undertaking if you're not exposed to these kinds of opportunities whether it's computer science or anything having to do with instructional technology you don't know where you can go that's a blocked off path for you if we can change the computer science educational pathways of youth today that they'll be able to take that knowledge into whatever career pathways they choose to pursue in the future to solve community issues and problems that need the diverse perspectives of many people to solve them i did i did i had it here it was okay okay welcome everyone to day two of cs edcon i'm sean roberts vice president of government affairs for code.org if i haven't met you yet please come say hi to me sometime this week i'm so appreciative that we all have this chance to be together and the great work you all are doing and i'm so appreciative of the momentum you all have built for computer science education in our country over the past several years we're going to get started with our first panel today lessons learned from district state and national computer science initiatives i'm especially excited and honored to be hosting this panel i'm just very interested in what our panelists have to say today i don't know what their answers are going to be i'm looking forward to hearing them along with you i think we're going to have a really great discussion this morning so we're going to start with some brief opening remarks from our panelists and during that time they'll be sharing some of the lessons they've learned from their own computer science initiatives we'll then move into some question and answer from you the audience and if you're live streaming with us from home welcome we would love for you to join the conversation tweet us using our hashtag csedcon and we'll try to answer those questions as well if my parents are worth watching please make sure you direct your questions toward the panelists they're very supportive of me so let's go ahead and get started and let's meet our panelists if you haven't had a chance to check in on your table tents yet using the qr code please do so joining us today first after 24 years as a teacher administrator and instructional aide kirsten basler was first elected to this to the position of state superintendent in north dakota in 2012 where she currently sits she's also the director of the national council of chief state school officers please join me in welcoming welcoming state superintendent kirsten basler since joining president buchelle's administration in 2019 claudia de la den and her team have trained over 46 000 teachers in el salvador she serves as the director general of the higher school of innovation in public administration and works to establish strategic partnerships to expand technology opportunities in particular for girls and women please welcome claudia de lerin secretary of benefit innovation republic of el salvador finally with over 20 years experience in los angeles unified school district here in la sophia is a member of the board of directors for the international society for technology and education she's been named to the most influential people in education technology and a next generation leader by ed scoop and she currently serves as the director of the instructional technology initiative at la unified please welcome sophia mendoza so let's go ahead and start with uh some lessons learned in your opening remarks just a few minutes for each of our panelists let's start with sophia great well good morning everyone and good morning afternoon to everyone and evening if some of our international folks joining us uh streaming you know it's been a very long time here in l.a unified for our cs movement and along those years i've kind of compiled a list of my top 10 lessons learned so i brought them to share them with you today the first is really leading with an organizational change management strategy anytime we want to bring about change my biggest tip is let's have an organizational change management strategy ready also it's been very important i know we had a video earlier that we shared with you around our call to action here in la unified is to center our computer science initiative around a social justice lens and the connection with that is finding your partners and that will also join that movement of computer science that's directed around social justice and cultivate a partnership really understanding the mutual beneficial aspects of partnerships and one that is really dear to me you know being you know i've been here with inela unified since i was a kindergartner i like to tell everyone that my mom dropped me off in kindergarten and she has yet to pick me up one thing i've noticed is that our educators love to be spotlighted right so when we spotlight our practitioners it inspires others to step into this new arena all the while you are continuously reinforcing the change that you want to see in your movement you we've done this through newsletters where as soon as you open the newsletter you're going to see a featured educator leveraging computer science in multiple different ways we've also highlighted and spotlighted educators during board of education meetings special showcase events where we have the educators tell their own story and their successes another big lesson learned is really influencing policy so i'm so glad we're here today because i'm really looking forward to a couple of sessions that i i want to attend around policy this is your chance to make your voice heard locally leveraging our district policies so that um you know we we have the support of our elected board members that has been such a major piece and then looking at how we collaborate regionally so another great aspect of being a regional partner here with code.org is that we're able to have those regional coalitions as well as specific legislative dates also looking to our administrators you know that's an untapped um group our administrators so when you're looking to impact policy and influence it don't forget about your administrator organizations also looking at how you might want to reimagine instruction around leveraging computer science also a big big piece because you know i'm going to share with you all i am not a computer scientist by degree i have learned to reimagine instruction i have learned to be prepared to be a learner so when you're inviting your administrators when you're inviting your educators to step into the cs arena it's really about being comfortable with being a learner but also articulating learning in different ways and i think the third one i'm sorry the the the next biggest piece that i think has been really beneficial is be being agnostic providing very thoughtful points for your educators you know here in la unified we have about 25 000 ish educators and doing so we have to meet our our educators where they might be on the continuum looking at different frameworks curriculum devices even having devices that are agnostic the platforms but overall looking for agnostic opportunities where it's a low floor and high ceiling easy entry points and my last tip would be let's collaborate more with higher ed looking at our areas of preservice so that's just a little bit about my top 10 lesson learned over the years great thank you very much sophia let's hear from claudia you're you're opening remarks on lessons learned in your national initiative in el salvador thank you thank you shane um first of all i want to thank you for the invitation i'm really glad to be here and and talk about uh the things that we are doing at el salvador well establishing partnership um with the private sector has been a priority for a president najib in this sense as a government we have we have seen signed important agreements with big tech companies such as microsoft google plazi oracle amazon nokia hp and dell as well as with the main telecommunications company in the country these agreements allow us to implement unprecedented strategies within the public administration to guarantee innovative and quality services in different areas such as education health and security as is common in countries of central america as government we face the challenge to find funds to develop projects allowed to allow us to build and maintain political and digital infrastructure for digital services so in this sense publicprivate partnership is a model that make resource more efficient reduce response times and considerably increases the scope of project for the benefit of our people this also increases the chance of success and sustainability of all projects in this way in el salvador from the secretariat of innovation we are working involving all different institutions of government with the private sector academia civil society and international organization within an innovation ecosystem that guarantees the closing of technological gap mainly through transfer of knowledge that allows the adoption of new technologies helping people to use computers and funds to learn about computer science also we are working on the rollout of digital infrastructure for connectivity in all the country this coordinated work allow us to influence important public policies as the higher education law where thanks to the approach with the private sector and academy together with the ministry of education and the ministry of economy we have identified the demand of the labor market at national and international level prioritizing our efforts towards the ones that guarantees greater job opportunities with more competitive salaries and this work incorporate our strategic allies such as code.org microsoft and plazi with whom we have developed in recent months a very ambitious project to train those salvadorians in higher education careers such as accelerated engineering for software development degree which include learning paths in computer science artificial intelligence cyber security cloud computing and others similarly together with other strategic allies also from the private sector we are designing degrees in telecommunications and fintech which respond to a strategic projects of our government all these learning paths are aimed at women and men of all ages to certify their skills through first level training programs in an accelerated mode that is one or two years maximum at the first higher school of innovation and technology in our country created by president bukele with a flexible and innovative academic curriculum started as totally virtual mode allowing to bring quality content to all people of all ages as a government and thanks to the partnership with private sector through this school we are providing completely free training programs through a scholarship and to thousands of salvatorians in order to guarantee the employability the people form the alliance with more national and international companies allowing salvadorans to work from our country accessing more opportunities from entrepreneurship or exporting the services obtaining truly competitive salaries that allow them to transform their life and those of their families thank you great thank you very much let's go on to superintendent basler your takeaways from your initiative in north dakota thank you so much sean um and thank you to code.org for hosting this very very important convening and this conversation for many years i think you're going to hear a theme from all of us i've heard it already you're going to hear the same thing from me and that is the theme of this doesn't happen overnight it needs to be done strategically and you need partners and that that's that's the way that it and that's the story of north dakota as well so our journey really began or my journey began uh nine and a half years ago when i took office my first lonely night in the capitol building uh my first legislative session as an elected official you uh you know you don't know how many cycles you're going to have you don't know how many years you might be able to make a difference and so i jotted out on a piece of notebook because i was a elementary principal and and teacher before that so i had my spiral bound notebook tore out a sheet of paper and thought jotted down some things that before my ride on the merrygoround was over i wanted to accomplish as an elected leader and one of those was to bring computer science and to to all of our students every zip code every child in north dakota that sticky note is or that spiral bound notebook is still taped to the inside of my cupboard door and we nine and a half years later we're we're at we're at a tipping point now in fact our special session will be meeting next week monday and we have a bill in to require it in all of our elementary middle and high schools and make it a graduation requirement so hopefully we can get it across the finish line fingers crossed so that brings me to the point of okay as an elected official as an educator and an elected official how do we do that the first thing that we needed to do was bring more people on board than just the education community as educators we're fully committed to our students parents are fully committed to their own children but the challenge is for parents for for families their kids kind of age out of the major issues uh they they are very passionate about making sure that their students have what they need in elementary school but as soon as they move on to middle school or high school they let somebody else worry about what's happening in elementary school so we needed to make this a different conversation more than just about what's best for students even if i didn't care and this is kind of how i talk to to legislators that aren't on the education committee those that get to vote for the appropriation and the policy that's going to complete this it's just pretend for a minute that i didn't even care about young people that i don't care about children this is an economic conversation that we need to have for our state of north dakota and that gets even those committee members that are serving on the the the government affairs committee or the uh taxation committee it gets them interested because we're talking about economy so we formed a partnership that's called pk20w and it's because this conversation about computer science needs to start with our preschoolers and continue through phd level work and into the workforce so we have a pk 20w group that has been meeting for the last four years so we're all hands on deck pushing the flywheel in the same direction and why pk because it's actually quite a pet peeve of mine that when we talk about computer science and cyber security that we tend to just talk about it through the lens of high school classes and college courses while very important it's true but we know that by the end of third grade young people have a belief of what they're good at and what they want to be that year between third grade and fourth grade is critically important so if we're just beginning to have a conversation about introducing computer science into middle schools we're too late as with any sector the workforce shortage issue is is is every sector's challenge right now with the great resignation but when our preschoolers come into their first you know day of school one of the first lessons that every preschool teacher does is hands them a pot of soil they plant a seed and they watch it grow and it's not because we want them to be agronomists or botanists or even farmers it's because it's part of their everyday world so similarly we need to begin to help our students understand what is happening around them how the internet works at preschool and help them develop those ideas so that's why we did prek pk 20w and making it an economic issue you really have to have that explanation that 30second elevator speech ready and make it about what's important to them employers need employees that are computer science literate there will never be a time where this generation is using less technology when you say those things and you make it about the economy you have the opportunity to have a broader influence and still care about kids and make sure that they're getting what they need for their future thank you superintendent i'd like to move to some questions now for for all of you um the the first one is i think this panel is really unique and one of the reasons i'm honored and excited to be able to host it is because we have uh so many different locations el salvador is very different from los angeles it's very different from north dakota and and so on but also the different levels at which you're approaching your plans from a district level from a countrywide level from a state level so one of the things i'm interested in is what you think you need from the other two levels in your role so maybe we'll start with you superintendent what do you need from a district level to be successful and what do you need from a national level to be successful so from the district level i guess what i would if i could have a magic wand and wave my wand is to have every teacher understand the importance of computer science and in north dakota we have computer science and cyber security skills so we have included another strategic i think important because words matter you can't get a lot of people excited often about computer science but everybody understands the importance and the urgency of cyber security so um if we can at the elementary level we have a better buy in with our elementary teachers understanding that it can be integrated should be integrated but unfortunately and when we reach middle school and secondary level that tends to be some other teachers responsibility and so if we can have more people take responsibility for being computer science cyber security teachers rather than just that math teacher or just that computer science certified teacher or that would be helpful so engaging our principals to understand that they need to have um allow the time for professional development to have teachers coplan together would be helpful and to really just maybe get out of their own disciplined content areas and understand that this is a holistic issue that every student needs what do we need from the national level i think that we we need to market this we need to continue to market this so you know when i speak nationally i'm not talking about the federal government at this point but as a nation we need to engage our workforce as as we've all know there isn't a there at the hearing on monday are the executive director of our hospitality association we'll be testifying in favor of this our commerce people will be in testifying in favor of this this move and so as a nation we all need to be talking about computer science and cyber security and you need to talk about it at your dinner parties on sunday afternoon when you know when you're when your football is on when your football team is on at halftime break talk about those things have that conversation federally you know it's it's it's wonderfully amazing that the national governors association is lifting this up as their event their chairman or their their the president of the nga um asa hutchinson is going to announce that that's his platform we need to have more leaders stepping up on a national level and saying this is important and this is a number one priority we have a point in time where we are the we are going to either be importing our talent on this issue or we will be providing the service to the rest of the world yeah it sounds like that's something secretariat you've done really well in el salvador is getting a common theme and messaging and leadership around computer science education i know el salvador's education system is uh more centralized than we have here in the united states so maybe for you the question is what do you need from the provinces you you work with and also the ministry of education what do you need from those entities to be successful well we are working in from the presidency with the ministry of education uh i have to say that before the pandemic and with the secretary of innovation vladimir hand that we work on develop a national digital agenda that contemplate inc import important areas all with very ambitious projects to achieve the digital transformation of our country in fact at that time we received the visit in our country of leonardo ortiz a vp of international partnership of cod.org and we agreed to implement in the coming years the computer science in the curriculum for all educational levels in el salvador however the pandemic accelerates the implementation of several of these projects mainly those related to education innovation and connectivity since the beginning of the pandemic or president naibokel established the importance of guaranteed educational continuing so under his mandate we began to work strongly with the ministry of education to implement a digital transformation project of the educational system which within the digital agenda was contemplated to be implement implement in the next 10 years with the pandemic the challenge seem bigger but we start training the teachers because teachers preparation is key in any education initiative and because the work that they are doing every day with the students in their classroom is one of the most important important part of all this project so we joined force with strategic allies and in the first three months we managed to digital literature for more than 46 dollars and teachers from the public and private sector training and certifying them in the use and management of the google classroom platform which by an agreement with google was adopted by our government as the platform for the for the entire public education system and we created more than 1.2 million google workspace accounts for all students and teachers at the same time we trained the specialists of the ministry of education for the creation of virtual content for all the soviet of all educational levels from early childhood to high school including the computer science content that code.org made available to us as the first step to include it in the national curriculum and now we are excited of how fast this effort is growing by that time we have trained 94 percent of teachers from public sector created a platform for educational continuity and also began to manage important financial cooperation projects with the idv and unicef what involves more than 85 million dollars to develop the state's own digital infrastructure for the connectivity of thousands of public schools and health units also by monday for president and the first lady gabriela we began to work on one of the most employment projects of our government the delivery of computer for all students and teachers in the public sector with an investment of more than 400 million dollars in order to provide all the resources that are necessary to guarantee the educational continuity delivery of equipment is a window of opportunities for all the students and their families who in addition to their computer receive a mobile data plan to guarantee connectivity and in the case of the more than 60 000 high school um students they also receive a virtual training program to learn english through the platzi platform all this has allowed us to implement in parallel hundreds of mass training programs not only for students and teachers but also for people of all ages including public servers whom we have even certified for the use of different digital tools currently we are training all means ministry of health technology staff on an advanced software development learning path that incorporate a training program to learn english the pandemic has shown us that we can accelerate the implementation of program aimed at closet closing at the technological and gender gap in this sense we currently implement inclusive programs for the adoption and use of technology providing all the tools so that more girls and women have better training and job opportunities so that they can continue taking spaces in the fields of science and technology and have a true participation in the digital transformation of our country achieving this implementation in an accelerated way has been possible thanks to the leadership of our president the articulated work between institutions and the private sector and the commitment of an incredible team which we work tirelessly every day to improve the life of salvadorians all these efforts take us to an unprecedented point in our country where children and young people can become who they want to be this true transformation of the education system involves profound changes that will allow more salvadorans to access more opportunities in the falls of science technology and innovation we are sure that in the coming years we will see exponential growth in the number of salvadorans specialized in robotics artificial intelligence machine learning aerospace or more programming skills and we are also sure that more salvadorians will lead technology companies in our country or outside as a result of all this great effort and i'm really excited for what this means for the future of el salvador thank you sophia how about you from a district perspective what would be helpful for you from a national perspective and also from your state you know i'd like to first start with with state because i think that has more of like this local impact you know i see multiple lanes that need to be running at the same time definitely the partnerships with our higher ed you know ensuring that our educators once they step into the classroom have the knowledge the disposition the skills to be able to integrate computer science effectively right i think that's number one because what we've seen happen recently is especially with our with our most youngest learners to our middle grades we're doing a lot of back filling for our educators so might that be great if there was a partnership where it was you come in and it also will help our educators feel that sense of belonging you know they come in they have these assets and they can immediately contribute to the school culture and the district culture so my number one would be how can we ensure that our educators are coming in prepared and have those skill sets from from higher ed so then that makes you know that brings up the question what is credentialing looking like what is you know what our authorizations looking like so that we can cast a wider net there are so many educators that want to teach computer science but if it's not being offered in their preservice then that's creating additional gaps so i see definitely those two lanes that would really help us as a districtwide the and then when i think about how the federal government can help and support us you know right now we're leveraging title four dollars and out of title four we have the effective use of technology bucket in there might it be amazing wonderful opportunity to create a statue where we can have dollars earmarked specifically for computer science education so just putting that out there in case anyone's listening so you know that's been very effective leveraging our title four dollars to really start some of the other expansion pieces here in la unified so i think those two pieces um for federal to create some sort of a statute for earmarking specific dollars for computer science education agreed um i want to open this up to the the entire panel um we we've talked about our lessons learned and what we've learned from our cs initiatives i want to look forward a little bit thinking about the various initiatives you have going on um in three years if you were not successful what what would have caused it do you think looking ahead three years from now let me make sure i understand the question sean so in three years if if we don't get this across the finish line what's the last part of the question yeah you you haven't met your goal that was in your notebook in three years what would you attribute that to well i'll take a stab at that so you know let's let's we don't live in a vacuum here we've just had a pandemic for the last 18 months and so i think that there's a there's a risk that some of us as a nation might say well we've got to focus on just the fundamentals we've got to focus on just recovering that lost learning time for our young people and keep our eye on that ball and we've had those conversations in our state i've had those conversations with our school leaders and i've had those conversations with my colleagues across the nation but the thing about it is if you if you step outside of that box if you step outside of i don't think anybody wants to return to normal we want our students to be learning and engaged in learning but we've realized because of the pandemic that learning can happen in a whole host of different ways and delivery methods and through a lot of different engaging activities that aren't necessarily what the traditional learning is so i i think that there the pandemic will certainly play a risk our our policy leaders our school district leaders may believe that they need to set computer science cyber security aside while they focus on recovery i would caution anybody that thinks that way that they're really selling their students short and they're selling their schools short hottie you know talks all the time about the impact that computer science courses have on reading and math scores in our elementary and just the increase that are of of those proficiency levels in math and reading so rather than look at the pandemic as something we have to address first we should be looking at using computer science to accelerate excite our young people and help in the recovery from the pandemic sophie are claudia any thoughts dad yeah i'd like to add um definitely you know what we have collectively experienced over the last 18 months yes it's been a disruption and we will continue to see disruptions continue to monitor the plan right so you know we've set out to do something yes we've had a huge disruption over the last 18 months and currently we're still seeing these disruptions um i think if we don't meet our mark in three years it will be because we were not closely monitoring we were not closely listening especially to our educators and listening to our families if we don't meet the mark that is because we have not tried something that we haven't done before thinking about these opportunities that we had over these last 18 months we really had to come together strategize quickly try something and iterate oh we found a bug oh let's try something different so really kind of applying some of those computer science strategies and principles to our inner workings as as a system whatever type of system you might be so um i think if we don't meet our mark that's because we were not listening we're not carefully watching um how things are are changing right in front of us who are you all learning from right now what resources leaders or examples are you taking from in your own initiatives that are influencing your leadership in computer science oh my goodness so i've learned a great deal from organizations like this cnn code.org cs4all microsoft teals all of our partners in north dakota that are helping me palo alto with the cyber security issues those are the partners that i'm learning from but but frankly i'm learning from all of you the the tremendous articles that are being written by computer science advocates educators yourself the the information that is shared on the listserv all of those things i take i digest i learn from i look into other states plans i look at the review of the state of the state and so i think i'm relying heavily on on my colleagues in the nation so some of the folks that i've been learning from i think someone who really had a profound impact when i started to look at how computer science can be integrated was dr mitch resnick in his work around the four ps and um bringing that work and you know yesterday you heard from our chief academic officer allison towery and she's really charged us with bringing that joy and engagement back into school and into learning and so that became a natural fit for us looking at how we can leverage computer science for engaging in mathematics gamebased learning um we think about the work that's happening right now with one of our partners just down the down the road university california los angeles and the work that is happening around cgi cognitive guided instruction that is something else that is also making connections to the broader education landscape here in los angeles so you know those are just uh just a few of several others but definitely coming to events like this meeting in the hallway with someone and just like getting your um those nuggets that that brain candy i like to call it because it's just these are opportunities to engage with one another and be inspired and also be influenced well in my case i have to say that this organization code.org is really inspiring for us we admire the work that you are doing um to transform life through teaching learning computer science and because this is a dynamic field which requires constant work a stroke commitment and a resilient attitude to embrace success but are also failure in order to learn from it but above all requires passion ambition to go beyond traditional strategies to implement innovative ones and you are doing that thank you what are you doing one of the things we talked about yesterday with the release of the state of cs report was the the difference between access and participation so there continues to be a gap in participation especially among our hispanic latino latina latinx students and also young women in computer science which secretariat i know has been a specific focus of of years i'm curious from from anyone what you're doing to encourage participation as well as access so about gosh i want to say maybe about four five years now here in la unified every year we celebrate computer science education week i mean it's a it's a big deal here in los angeles so much so that our board of education members you know have marked it with a resolution to bring computer science in various ways to our most youngest learners our middle grade and our and our secondary students and the the resolution that they've passed is really to ensure that our most youngest learners have 20 hours of computer science and we catch and we hook so many educators during that awareness of computer science education week and there's multiple types of entry points for our most youngest learners and those educators to step into whether it be let's just try an hour of code or it might even be i'm a school site principal and i'm inviting my local principals to come check out what we've done here at our school and then that kind of starts to inspire others like wow you're doing it i think i better do something like this um so it's it's those type of opportunities with professional development i know claudia mentioned earlier like professional development is like at the heart of what we need to do and prepare our educators but not just bringing our educators to a professional development but ensuring that they walk away with the tools they have the strategies but those physical computing devices again whatever they might be you know again being diagnostic whatever physical computing devices they need to implement with their entire class not just with two students not just with four but if you need a class set you're gonna walk away with the class set that's how important our board members uh and sirius have have taken their resolution to ensure that the funding is backing up this resolution so those are some ways that we want to bring that dis close that disparity but we still have a long way to go not going to sugarcoat that we have a long way to go i think my colleague tabitha thiel is here with me and she is part of the edutech team in north dakota but she could list off she could rattle off a whole lot of things that they're doing and i'll touch on some of those in a minute but i'm a firm believer that student outcomes don't change will never change until adult behaviors change and so i mean that that's just a fact student outcomes will never improve never change until adult behaviors do and so i think we have to do as much educating of school board members helping them set not only reading and writing goals for their district but computer science goals and equity and access goals uh helping our leaders do that specifically what are some boots on the ground things that we're doing um we there's our i t chief information officer has created um uh replicating march madness where they're doing computer science competition during the month of january and february making it fun uh girls who code um partnering with the girl scouts providing our local communities our boys and girls clubs within our communities in the state providing them funding to actually start up coding clubs for afterschool programs integrating it expecting it for the 21st century grants that the state provides to school districts in the state um providing that as a if for because they're competitive grants if they have computer science and coding activities as part of their after school programming their 21st century program they get more they get additional points and so really incentivizing there's only so many levers that you have right as a state as a state leader you have policy and you have funding and so we try to push and pull those levers as much as we can by incentivizing our partners which is why partnership is so so critically important how the the the racial equity i want to speak to a little bit as well north dakota has shares its borders with five sovereign nations and so we are behind the nation and the number of native american students that have access to and are engaging in are taking taking computer science courses at all levels that's not okay and so we have to go to them we have to go to their nation we need to go to their tribal leaders we need to partner with them just this morning a member of my team and tabitha we're on a oneonone call with a specific school that was is on one of our reservations the standing rock reservation telling them that we will come to them they don't need to go come to us what do they need specifically tailoring our offerings our professional development and our services to those those schools that we share our nation or share our borders with no superintendent you just made me think about something that you know bringing the the um services to the communities um you know one thing that we have found success and thank you for sparking my memory on that um one of our partnerships was with google they have googlers right have you met any of the googlers that um it was really important for our students to see themselves in this role you know when we talk about racial identity gender identity our partners at google you know raised their hands they said hey we have a whole we have a team here and you know we're in la or stone's throw from silicon valley from your hotel room you can probably see silicon valley i'm sorry not silicon valley silicon beach apologies silicon beach and googlers came out to the schools and you know we we said we want to make sure they look like our students and they come from represented neighborhoods from our students and they stepped up and they brought googlers that you know identified with the stories of our students so that i mean just remind remembering about that that gives me chill so that was another way that we wanted to have our students kind of see themselves in professions that were connected to computer science education we have time for audience questions we have two microphones at either end here welcome the opportunity for anyone to take advantage of of this to ask questions of our distinguished panelists here also obviously if you're live streaming as we said at the top you can use the hashtag csedcon to submit any questions you might have any questions for our panelists uh hello thank you for your time short guy here um so sam morris from north carolina i'm a code.org regional partner and a common theme has been partnership between private industry and education and one of the one of the challenges i see as we try to do that is companies and industry right now are desperate for return on investment right that they see the more the more ripened fruit to be college students community college students a 12 year old who they might impact is 10 years away from employability and showing up on a csr roi report that their investment paid off how do you sort of phrase the conversation or help them better see the investment in a 12 year old versus just recruiting that 22 year old out of college thanks so i'm just going to add that you know i think it's important with any partner that you bring to the table is that you're clear with what your expectations are and what those outcomes those and i want to say this it's mutually beneficial outcomes right and i know in the work that we've done with our partners and one of the reasons i feel it's been why it's been so successful is because our partnerships our partners want to build on our assets they don't want to come in and fix us they say what do you have and where do you want to grow and we share with them we want to grow from an instructional lens an instructional purpose here are our instructional outcomes where can this be a mutually beneficial conversation as opposed to taking it from you know what are they going to get where is their roi at the end of the day and maybe that might not be a fit and it's okay sometimes to say it's not a fit right now and that's just what i found to be successful within our partnerships so that's a really great question and a really hard question if it were easy we'd have you know we'd have done it right i mean we'd have figured it out what are we waiting for but it is really hard and i understand that um i think that's what is so hard about education in general the the return on investment the investment that you make in five and sixyearolds is a long time and basically educators stick with it to see that that roi so what we've found has been successful with some of the companies that we've worked with isn't necessarily the roi that they'll get from that student or that classroom that they are helping but in actually allowing their current employees to go in and make a difference in the world and so we found that this generation of 20somethings and you know early 30somethings job satisfaction matters and so while they're doing you know technical work and in a work that is has a has a fiscal you know a bottom line to it they also have a desire to to be of service and give to their community and so those community those partners that we've found success with has been the roi that they got on a happier current workforce by allowing them to go in and help in their child's school or in their neighborhood school or they've always wanted to be a teacher they've always wanted to be you know it brings back great memories but they just you know teachers don't make a lot for whatever economic reasons but allowing them that's where they get the more immediate roi is from their current workforce higher job satisfaction it is important that all the strategic allies that we we are identifying and all the the path that you are working share the same mission and that passion for designing implementing and promoting programs for teaching computer science is a is a way so um you have to find take your time it like sofia said it's okay if it don't work you know you have to find that allies that share all the vision that you are implementing in your work i think we have time for one more question thank you hi i'm kathy schofield i'm a code.org regional partner from florida and um i i thank you for sharing everything from the district the national and estate level and what i'm curious about very granular is your professional development that you're doing and all are you making modifications to either like the state level course descriptions or locally the um curriculum guides and pacing maps that when the teacher goes to their common resources are they able to see where this fits into um their everyday life in the classrooms that's a that's a great question um thank you for that so i did fail to mention that in 2015 we had put to forward a suite of bills uh during that session where a biennial legislative session it was a threepronged approach and the first was develop computer cybersecurity standards that did not lead legislative action that was under the authority of the department so we were able to do that independently the second was to create credentials so we received authority from our state legislature to authorize authorizing the department to issue credentials to be added to teacher licenses at each level so we have different credentialing expectations for elementary middle and high school teachers so we've uh we have computer science cyber security level one or level level one two and three in ascending order so the professional development that we do with those is certain number hours the more the higher the credential the the um the more hours that you would need we partnered with our north dakota university system uh our state system and particularly our bismarck state college polytechnic college to issue the highest credentials so they'll they'll get their credential from a university system so the professional development that we do is actually tailored to whatever needs those school districts are and again partnering with our i.t department the edutech arm of that the technology education technology arm of that we go out and do provide the technology provide the professional development that is in person and online obviously and we partner with our regional education agencies we have seven reas in our state that we also partner with and again the leverage that we have is the authority of policy to issue the credential and then the funding to support our reas and our edutec partners and as far so the other piece of our is their access and so so 2015 is we've had the credentials since since 17 um and now we're bringing together paying teachers for their time right we shouldn't ask them to work for free but we're paying teachers to come in and develop lessons that are integrating computer science and cyber security into math english science so our teachers don't need to start from scratch and we'll have a warehouse of those lessons that we'll integrate available to our north dakota teachers based on align to our north dakota standards in those content areas if i could add on something we've been able to do and have some i like to say some some success with this and i won't be able to give like examples of every outcome but um we do have a twitter handle at iti underscore lausd and then we have a hashtag cs4lausd where you can see examples of what it looks like in the lower grades even you'll see some four year olds and some twoyearolds but i think what's really unique about us here in la unified is that we have a dedicated central office team because you know we live in a duality here in la unified we're not only centralized but we are also decentralized so by having this dedicated uh team that works on that develops designs iterates professional development they're able to be nimble we're able to make these quick turns where we're looking at the framework the k12cs framework we're looking at the computer science standards in california and another overarching umbrella that we leverage when we do our design and around computer science lessons and content for our most youngest learners we do leverage the international society for technology and education standards like these are huge big goals and dispositions that you can apply to all content areas but we've really taken that lens to layer it on top of our computer science professional development so any professional development you come to you're going to see a connection to the iste standards but with that i think what's most unique for our most youngest learners is that when our educators attend these sessions we ask them what are you again building on their assets what are you going to be teaching in your next unit bring those concepts bring those standards that you're going to need to teach and then they have the opportunity to start building the lesson there and then come back two weeks later and then share with the larger community what they've learned so in essence we start creating these repositories of experiences and what it looks like because we get asked that question well what does it look like for a twoyearold to experience computational thinking um computer science dispositions and strategies so i welcome you to visit our twitter handle as well as the hashtag cs4lausd for our final remarks here would love to hear just from each of you a one sentence takeaway you're either taking away from this panel or that you would like the audience to take with them from from our remarks of our discussion today i will say just one word inspired you know the moment um i opened up the schedule for this event i was just super inspired you know and then when i stepped in the other day the energy you all have brought the the colleagues that i've met the keynote speakers just again inspired so thank you i would say what i taking away is that this this work is about relationships it's about in cultivating opportunities for our young people for our for our students and it's really about inspiring that growth i i think inspired is is the theme for me as well so the relationships the the opportunities that can be created and inspiring us to all grow and get better we're in this together um i think that also inspiring but empowering because um we all all we know that computer science changed life and we have to empower principally more girls more women to use digital tools use the the internet the in now in a way that they feel secure and free to use it so it's important that we we have spaces to share all the experience all the work that we are doing so that's the way that i define great thank you all um we have about 15 minutes until our next sessions start i encourage you to think about this the same question for yourself what you're taking away from the the morning plenary and this great group of cs leaders we we've had the opportunity to learn from today and share it with a colleague of yours as you move forward today for me personally i'm really thinking a lot more about that federal funding strategy for for computer science and how that fits in between state and and national private public partnerships as well that i've taken away from all of our panelists here today so please join me in thanking our panelists one more time for joining us here thank you sean claudia kirsten sophia thank you so much our next session is our birds of feather discussions these are facilitated discussions not presentations um so please pick your the topic that you're interested in there are eight topics and actually a number of these topics reflect what you were interested in when you filled out your registration uh form so again those are the rooms those are the topics after that we're gonna go into our first breakout session slot of five breakouts that's from 11 30 to 12 30. then we'll have lunch that's a great time by the way to catch up on that email you know work never stops even when you're at a conference and then in the afternoon two to three pm we'll have more breakouts and then a happy hour at the end um one more thing rapid antigen testing just wanted to give you a reminder we'll be in the san diego room which is actually right next door from 3 to 5 p.m today just to let you know that and that's obviously free you're dismissed thank you very well done i can make your hands claps luxury am i the only living soul around
