hi i'm jevon and i'm a computer science student at university of washington what first drew me to computer science is just the sheer amount of innovation that the field has there's just a lot going on at any given time and depending on what you choose to do you can make groundbreaking discoveries in many many fields so that really just like keeps me motivated to keep on learning and just do as much as i can so i got a brand new robot but it only knows how to move forward and turn left i want to teach my robot how to move in a square the robot should do this whenever i give it the command square we write methods to represent commands that we can give objects in our programs to write a new method in a class we first have to write the method signature a method signature consists of a name and a parameter list let's write a square method in our robot class we want the method to be accessible by the whole program so we'll start with the keyword public the next part of the method signature specifies what the method should return in this case the square method should perform an action and not return a value so let's add the keyword void this indicates that the method has no return value next we'll state the name of the method then we need to decide if this method will have any parameters the square method does not need any parameters so we'll just write empty parentheses we'll open a set of curly braces to indicate the block of code that should run when this method is called inside of the curly braces we'll write our code to move in a square so we'll move forward and then turn left until we've moved into a square let's create a robot object called myrobot we can use our new square method to have my robot move in a square as many times as we'd like you can write your own methods to give a name to a command you can use these methods as many times as you need and it saves you the hassle of having to rewrite code every time
