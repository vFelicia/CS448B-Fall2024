welcome everyone this is our QA event with CEO and founder of code or kadhi part OV we're really excited to have hottie with us tonight and we're going to jump into his presentation in just one minute go to the next slide I just wanted to bring your attention to the fact that we're going to be having a series of these live on event live events online for CS educators over the next several months we're generally having them on on Wednesdays or Thursdays towards the middle of the month this first session is the QA with Hattie part OV next month we're going to be talking about how we increase access to CS education and looking at some of the results of code orbs recent evaluation work and then moving into november and december we'll be taking a look at hour of code and how you can read it in your classroom so we're super excited that you're joining us tonight for the first session and we'll dive right in if you go to the next slide bar i'm really excited to introduce hardy for Toby many of you know hottie is the CEO and founder of code org hottie is such an inspiration to all of us and has really been a driving force behind all the great work that we're doing here as an organization and tonight we've got a number of questions lined up for hottie but before we dive into those I wanted to ask howdy to share a few opening words how do you do you want to go ahead and do that sure ad is this working I think it's working it in first for anybody who's dying and i should say this is our first time doing it dismissed format melissa is literally in the room right next door so that the fact that we're on different screens is kind of funny code.org is a slightly larger organization than the tiny tiny startup it was two years ago at but we're still a pretty small bootstrap startup so we're kind of figure everything out as we go ad and this is our first of these teacher community style ad online hangouts we are hopeful to do at least one a month to sort of build it in the community in touch with lesson to hear their questions and to help inspire people I want to briefly talk about just a quick state of the world of what code org does at an this is going to be more about beyond the hour of code every I think I think everybody here is aware of the hour of code campaign it's probably the headline effort of what co.org does but the four other bullets here are the things that we actually spend the most of our time on and that's what I personally focused the most on at one creating fantastic curriculum as online courses for students to take but more actually directly thinking about the classroom and giving teachers a tool that they can use to teach computer science even if they have them before at the second is partnership with school districts to add computer science the curriculum add which then quickly gets into doing teacher training and hosting professional development workshops to prepare non CS teachers to become CS teachers and lastly changing state and in some cases federal policies to help bolster computer science and to quickly summarize where we are with these things had I think you need to click on the animation scrubbers controlling these our metrics of success at first of all is that our online courses now reach six million students we're now in partnerships with 70 school districts had we've trained 15,000 teachers and we have changed policies in 18 different states now all of these are pretty insanely big numbers for a two year old organization at that's kind of just figuring things out the hardest of these by four has been at the 15,000 teachers having gone through PD workshops you know we we I think are one of the largest PD organizations in the country at this point with the number of teachers that have gone through our pediat although I would say that most of that is going through one day PD in our elementary school program focusing on the six million students had something that's somewhat insane is just that the scale of this work code studio our learning platform was only launched at less than two years ago it's now has a hundred and fifty thousand teachers on the platform and six million students we've had seven billion lines of code written by students as you probably know these lines of code are just dragging and dropping at code but still the fact that that's been done seven billion times is pretty crazy and most importantly ten percent of all elementary and middle school students in the united states have created an account on the platform which is at a stunning success not just for code or but for the 150,000 teachers that have gotten engaged in bringing this to their students and then lastly the thing that I'm probably the most excited about is the diversity at these students when you when you look at the tech industry in general you see a very very under sticker when you look at the code org student body it's almost perfectly balanced with diversity we still have a little bit of room to go on the gender of our students and if you take out the students that basically sign up for code.org at home and look at the ones that are in classrooms it's actually a perfectly balanced as to in an audience which basically proves out the theory we had that if you teach this in school where all the kids are it becomes something that no longer represents the stereotypes that people bring to technology and you know out of our six million students were now at the point that there's two million women and too many two million black and Hispanic students on the platform and those numbers are gigantic compared to the traditional software computer science space you know to put it in perspective u.s. University's Graduate eight thousand women a year in computer science and the entire software engineering profession in the United States is 500,000 women you know our elementary and middle school girls aren't software engineers but the fact that those two million of them relative to 8,000 and university is still a huge deal so computer science just through a few years ago was this sort of little field that could and had a small number of people that wanted it to grow it's now become the fastest spreading course in public education and the schools that offer it they see record enrollment by students this is a picture of the AP computer science class just in the last few years at where you know 2013 and beyond its been at the fastest growing course in the in the 2010s decade but we still have a long long way to go ninetyfive percent of high schools don't even teach computer science at the AP level and seventyfive percent of high schools don't teach any form of computer programming that's it for my quick sort of state of the world of cobourg and computer science and mainly I wanted to just open things up to a QA ad I'm happy to be here and answer whatever questions people have for me thanks so much Hattie so we have a number of questions i'm already queued up for you and for folks who have further questions for Hattie we would really love to make this an interactive session so if you could go ahead and type your questions into the chat pod on blue jeans or tweet them at teach code hashtag move forward I mean if we have time later on in the session I can also call on folks individually to turn their mics on and off and actually speak and have a dialogue which I think would be really fun as well so how do you justice or not much preferred I'd much prefer to have Mike's going turning on an office of as it's super impersonal it'll feel weird for me yes sorry and I know that's totally that's totally a good idea I think the one of the what best ways to manage that is if you have a webcam tonight and you want to turn it on your picture will show up along the bottom of the screen so I can see Joel and Alana already and Joel Alana or anyone who's webcam is on if you'd like to ask patty a question you can raise your hand physically then I can call on you a oneonone right so the Joel just waved to us so i could say Joel unmute yourself and ask us a question and Joel I know you actually did post a question on Twitter's evening so maybe you want to kick us off by asking that one oh hello hello hottie how you doing today that's right the question I see is what I get a lot from from teachers and from legislators is is where do you see this movement going like what is your what's your fiveyear plan what you know what do you see where do you see code organ fiveyear or DC computer science in five years you know what's the what's the big picture you know so so in its so much so many of us work in the classroom but look at the small picture in daily basis looks like the big overarching picture that you guys see yourselves in 3 5 7 years sure you know my my long term view is that computer science belongs in the curriculum in a similar place as something like biology or chemistry or pick a subfield of math and you know those nobody questions why those things are being taught in schools there's no effort to try to get biology into the school system it just is at and there's no biology org that exists to help make sure people are teaching biology it's just part of the system so our longterm goal is to get computer science to have that same position but if you look at it feel like biology you know that the field has existed for a long time at you know it people were studying biology I think before schools existed but if you look at more recent fields you know electricity has only been studied for about a few hundred years but it's in most schools kids learn how a light bulb works and how batteries work and many many schools certainly more than computer science have a physics class that teaches more about electromagnetism and etc so getting computer science to reach its place in the world alongside those fields is our longterm goal add and my hope is that at some point is that in 10 years is that in 20 years or is it sooner that code.org can move to a model that is more about supporting something that's already in the school system had but between now and there we're doing everything we can to get ourselves there and that's working both top down and bottoms up at the same time you know at the top down level we're trying to get states and governments and in some cases even countries to pass regulations that either required Computer Sciences taught or at least support it when it is taught you know right now when we started computer science was kind of this bastard stepchild of the education system and if you're a computer science teacher you need to constantly kind of advocate why you even exist I don't think that there's too many computer science teachers that feel that way anymore had you know if anything that they're being asked you know offered new jobs at other schools and it's become a much more hotly demanded field but you know the top down approach alone isn't enough if you look at a country like the UK they've made a topdown mandate that every school must teach this and everybody's kind of at the school level rolling their eyes and wondering is that what's it going to mean and they look you know there's other topdown mandates in the American education system that you look at topdown mandates don't have fantastic teacher response so really co.org is a lot more about the bottoms up grassroots movement really led by teachers and empowering teachers who believe that this is right for their students and so the majority of our work is supporting those teachers to just put this in the classroom and then to develop a enough teacher capacity to let the administration's frankly catch up with what's happening on the ground anyway thanks Hattie a related question that came to us through the chat pod here in blue jeans what are you seeing across the different states in terms of teacher licensing and how quickly are we moving towards CS certification um that's a great question I put that in the context of a number of policy related questions that really can't be resolved by individual teachers you know if you're a individual teacher you can just start introducing concepts to your kids and nobody will you know to tell you exactly how you should or shouldn't do that but there's a whole bunch of state policy issues that really only the state can resolve it's something the federal government can't do your your individual principal or school district can't do either at one of those as standards one of those is teacher licensing and credentialing another them is what are the requirements for what a school of Ed should be teaching preservice teachers you know because one of the most important things that that happens in our education system that is overlooked is the schools of Education which are graduating thousands of teachers a year and those teachers come with the sort of they're already set up learning and knowing how to teach biology for example but you know that the incoming graduates each year don't have the computer science skills all of these pieces need to be adjusted at the state level we have an extremely small team it's one person that now just we just hired somebody new so it's two people who are working with the various states on these issues and the work that code org does is mostly helping States just wrap their mind around what needs to be changed add and sort of supporting states that care about this enough to go forward add actually enjoy stay the last question um Joel state is one of the leading states in terms of passing a comprehensive legislative package to basically drive computer science throughout the state happen but teacher certification in particular comes up it's a little gnarly because in some cases you have science or math teachers who've learned a little bit of cs in some cases you have software professionals who've learned a little bit of teaching and both of those are already in classrooms and at any state that wants to set up licensing rules for sure needs to grandfather and whoever's already teaching CS had the worst thing that could happen is kind of getting existing CS teachers told that you can't do it anymore unless you get a certificate but we do need to get states to establish policies to at least define what what it means to be a CS teacher because without that you can't get schools abed actually producing CS teachers and you need to set some bar so so it organizations such as code over know what to aim for we're actually about to publish sort of a draft recommendation for states to adopt for teacher licensing and we're in conversations with a number of states about this issue great there's some really great questions in the chat pod from Brittany and Kathy I don't know if either of you have a mic would like to meet and then Angie I see your hand as well Brittany did you want to ask your question about curriculum let's see I can ask it for her as well so Brittany said that she's recently been brought on board to build the STEM program in their school hottie in the school district rather and she wonders what advice you have on what you think is a must for middle and high school students they're already doing code.org so what else should middle and high school students see before they graduate in your opinion um all right hi Brittany had its funny we I usually don't use the word stem ad not just basically because it's a little bit confusing and different it means that different things for different people and it's kind of funny that the there's a guy at code.org who actually coined that word at back where he worked in Capitol Hill who's now at greatly regrets it because the amount of sort of multiple uses stem has and the reason I don't love the term is because first of all the average parent has no idea what stem is we've acted in a survey and seventy percent of parents don't know what stem means at all of them know what computer science means have but the real confusion is math and science are probably already being taught in your school so when you say you're in charge of stem it's probably not the M or the s in stem it's probably the tea and the e because those are the parts that aren't taught in most schools ad so and for the technology and engineering parts you know what co.org provides just I think today had initial curriculum to help people get started we have a program that basically has deeper curriculum that we bring to school districts but only when we partner directly with those school districts so that the the courses that are on our online code studio platform those are designed for elementary or early middle school students and we're busy working on rolling out of a longer deeper middle school course and a longer high school course by one years from now somewhere by one year for now we'll have a complete high school course that's like our elementary school courses and by two years from now we'll have a complete middle school course as well we don't have those a hundred percent done yet we're piloting the high school course right now will be piloting the middle school course next year but an interim there's a ton of additional resources I would look at you know at the high school level had frankly if you go to code org slash educate / thirdparty you'll see all of our recommendations for courses had the ones I'd give shoutouts to add if you want a sort of purely online formats either Khan Academy's computer programming course or the code HS computer programming course are really great ones and don't require a teacher to have gone through a PD program beforehand but if you want to have you the teachers in your district to go through PD there's a bunch of other sub providers alongside co.org cool they see give training to the existing teaching staff to integrate computer science and we're all about computer science but since you said stem I think you should for sure look at a number of the various robotics or maker type opportunities out there we we don't really do much the sort of maker movement at not because we dislike it but just because we focus on computer science alright Angie thank God Angie hi so my question kind of goes off of Joel's question and it's what are some unique or interesting jobs that you have run into in the computer science field or people that you've met and you're like wow that's a great job more people should know about that so that we can bring those to our teachers and our students you mean do mean jobs for software engineers or people who have learned computer programming yeah yep um yeah the the things I mentioned for stuff like this aren't just people who have cool jobs are usually things that stretch people's vision of what computer programming or software impacts and we actually are about to release a video specific to this as part of our new computer science principles course just to show how far is changing literally every industry for me the most extreme one of this is the impact that software has had on ornithology most people I haven't even heard of Ornithology ornithology is the study of birds at so birdwatching has been around for I think I don't know for as long as people have existed some some of them have watched birds um but recently ornithologists made a breakthrough learning in ornithology which is understanding why birds fly in a V ad and you know you may wonder why do black birds fly in a V why aren't they in a different shape while I am just a straight line and computer scientists basically attached little GPS devices to all these bird's wings to measure their exact position relative to each other to find out why they fly in a V and they found out that you know when the front bird flaps their wings the air is pushed down and then over the next two words birds fly on top of that air the air comes back up and so each bird's wings help lift the next bird which use software to if you look at any field you can find things like that in the field of Agriculture there's a startup that makes a product called lettuce spot which is this gigantic robot on wheels that is that you drive it over a field and it's the front of the robot is scanning the lettuce you know taking pictures of it and analyzing it and by the time the back of the robot gets to the lettuce it's like kind of a long truck with all these cameras in the front and all these things in the back and the front of it is scanning the lettuce in the back of it is spraying things on the lettuce and each lettuce gets a different treatment based on what the picture of the front of the robot saw at which you know instead of having individuals look at a lettuce and spray something differently you just drive on top of them and it does the job have you know things in entertainment or communication that are just see so I usually look at the fields that you don't think of as being impacted by technology had certainly transportation in space and things like that when you see people like Elon Musk it's an interesting thing in Detroit the home of the auto industry the most wanted job is for software engineers not for mechanics or manufacturers or so on so honey there's a little bit of discussion going on in the chat pod related to what you were saying about our middle school and high school pilots there's been a couple different kinds of questions some teachers have asked you know I started teaching code.org this year what am I going to do next year what do you what are you going to have ready for me similarly I'm in Australia what can I do when is code data or partnership coming here so I think folks would love to hear from you about sort of how you would approach this year and next year and how teachers can use what we have and then also plan for the future sure that you know I'll mention the Australia one first which is that we have our hands pretty full with the United States mmm partly because it's a big country but also because it's an incredibly decentralized education system and there's a whole lot of other countries that are just topdown saying we're just going to teach computer science in every single classroom and that's just done you know Australia actually just recently announced that at South Korea though the UK and a year ago in the u.s. each individual state would need to do that except for those states that constitutionally can't in which case each individual school district we need to do that so add you know solving the problem in the u.s. separate from the size of the population is like dealing with 50 different countries add so we focus our advocacy efforts and our teacher training and professional development and district management efforts in the US but our curriculum is being used globally already and certainly in englishspeaking countries everything we produce for the u.s. is available in those countries and in the nonenglish speaking countries that we have volunteers that help us translate and we're always looking for more translation volunteers with respect to our online courses AB and it's a really tough balance to deal with what's the right amount to provide for the teacher who's just getting started versus the teacher who's like gotten into it and loves it and just want me once more so one thing will be start doing is in our courses right now they just have numbers here's course one hears course 2 here's course three at one thing we recently decided as we want to differentiate sort of the core poor the course from the bonus materials so that you know everybody can do course one the short version and then if you want more of course when you could do the bonus materials at and our fourth course in that sequence is still not done yet it's got a little beta tag on it but for sure if your kids are zooming through courses two and three at course for when it's done is going to be much harder to zoom through it will have much more challenging programming puzzles in it and our CS principles course it's not nearly as student driven and so on that's designed for high school but both are both the upcoming courses I mentioned are going to be relying a lot more on teacher facilitation have you know the top feedback we get about our elementary school courses are that they don't leave as much room for projectbased creativity and they're more about just here's a puzzle solve the puzzle and the projectbased creativity is way more exciting for the students but it also is harder for the teachers because we can't as code or we can't tell if you made a good project or a bad project you need somebody else to sort of review that work and help you build whatever it is you want to build so that's why we started with the puzzles because that kind of reduces the teachers have onus in terms of knowing the field themselves thanks Hattie I'm just going to pull up more web cams here in case there are folks who'd like to ask how do you question you can bet and raise your hand gasps testing with the tie your hands a lot I don't know if you have a question or if you're just adjusting I also don't know your names I apologize for that but if you like to ask adding a question feel free anyone else that would like to ask the question just raise your hand with your mic ha be a fun question here what's your favorite unplugged activity and why I don't actually know the name of the unplugged activity but I'll say I'm the one that is my favorite I had a small role in creating it so that may be part of the why um although I think the reason that created it is because it's my favorite not the other way around um but it's the unplugged activity that teaches how packets work on the internet and how information is travelled in packets between routers going from the source of the destination where there's little pieces of paper and kids need to pass it from person to person until it gets to its end goal and the reason I like that is because it's actually quite easy to do you just have little you know little pieces of paper that show the destinations address on them and you had them from person to person and one thing you quickly realize as kids is you don't need to do or thank you Mike for pointing out it's called relay programming at the ad but you quickly realize as kids you don't need a lot of instructions to basically hand the package to know which direction to send the packet to to eventually get it to your goal you know you see this one needs to go to Bob and you just look and see whoever's between you and Bob and you give it to that person add and add basically as an individual you do the exact same thing that a router does and a router doesn't know how the entire internet works it just knows who's on which direction and sends it to in that direction so how do we think that one's actually called the Internet Mike Harvey favorite uncle Hubbins I've brought oakham what you saw that we have made it kind of a big commitment to unplugged in our curriculum why what do you think the benefit is of having unplugged and plugged lessons side by side um it's funny this is probably a topic of a lot of vigorous debate at you know I never did any unplugged exercises when I learned computer science so i can't speak from personal experience in terms of the benefit from my own learning but i know there's a number of benefits of unplugged exercises one is at the elementary grades for sure add it's just useful to get the kids up and moving you know kids especially boys just need to like let out some energy and and add if you just force them to have their heads in front of the computers that they might not sort of get a chance to do that and often their parents don't want to see their kids have their heads and screens the entire time so those little is just sort of physical you know social reasons to do it um but the other reason is there's an equity reason which is that if you start computer science just with coding a bunch of kids will already know it and a bunch of kids won't and the ones who don't already have some experience on day one they feel like I'm the worst student in the class and everybody else already knows this and I'm bad and they're good or as if you start with an unplugged lesson most likely none of the kids have done that and it's just about pure problem solving and you know the kid who didn't go to an afterschool summer camp can start at the same level and not feel sort of left out or fallen behind and that's also a very valuable reason the last reason is there are a whole bunch of things that you don't actually learn from from just writing code that and that's part of why the internet unplug lesson is the one I mentioned had because there's no like computer programming sort of problems that that teaches you how at how the internet works as a packetswitched Network that's not a computer programming topic it is a computer science topic but if you want to teach it you you need something different than just writing a computer program in order to teach it and that's that unplug lesson does a really good job so how do we have a question from a frame who's Mike is not working but he would like to know what's code.org doing to reach students of color and get them interested in computer science um that's a great question add you know we care a ton about diversity except that it's not in our name and the reason it's not in our name is because you know you see a lot of organizations who have one particular diversity goal in there in the tightly know if they're girls who code or girl develop it or black girls who code or etc at we're just code org and the reason is because we think all kids should get exposed to this and the most fundamental way we do that is by aiming to get this into the school system ad and you know if you look at the average school classroom it's a very diverse classroom and you have diversity there already and so if we get the average school classroom to teach computer science then we actually solve the diversity problem that's kind of kind of a hand wavy answer so I'll just go to actual specifics of things we're doing and one thing is you know when we make district partnerships we're focused on the largest school districts in the country which happen to also have the most underprivileged kids which happen to also have the most black and Hispanic kids so we're in New York City Chicago Los Angeles Miami Las Vegas at Broward County Houston at these seven districts alone have about fifteen percent of the black and Hispanic population in the country had and in fact in our courses in those school districts were you know are thirtyseven percent overall black and Hispanic population is much smaller than what it is in those school districts where we have a sixty percent black and Hispanic population in the sort of code or classroom at the other thing that we do is to make sure the people in our videos represent a diverse group and this is a pretty hard thing to do em and kind of funny when you think about the work that we end up doing but every video we make we we keep track of how many white people are there in the video how many black people how many brown people how many boys how many girls how many old how many young you know to make sure that we don't have too much of anything and to just represent this as a field that everybody participates in and we also try to make sure we don't have too many you know social media website game developer people so we have people working from medicine or people working from entertainment or so on to show that this is not just about building a website or building an app and it's also just about building things that impact any parts of society had lastly the facilitators who do at who hosts professional development workshops for us are also a very ethnic group at and so if you look at the traditional computer scientists the traditional computer scientists is generally a white male in terms of the teachers in the classroom it's the only field of teaching where there's more men who are teachers than women had whereas if you look at our pd facilitators they're more women than men and that alone is it had an important thing for us thanks Hattie I've noticed a few folks have joined us sort of Midway so just to remind everybody if you have questions for had a you can put them in the chat pod here on blue jeans or tweet them with at teach code howdy what was your proudest moment at code data code dad work so far um my proudest moment was also my most shameful moments was kind of a weird extreme of both but it was basically standing in the White House as the president walked in to do his very brief hour of code and said how amazing co.org and he said coder is doing amazing thing for our country as amazing organization and in the back I mind our website was down because too many other people were doing the hour of code so I didn't know whether to you know jump up for joy or cry or as kind of trying to do both at the same time um but it definitely was I don't think there's anything more special than having you know the president of your country call out your work especially just 22 years after we started so that was pretty awesome that's great as a similar fun question have you coded while surfing I know the answer to this one um actually yeah that's kind of for people who don't know the background at my favorite thing to do on the side is wakesurfing which is kind of like waterskiing surfboard ad and you know surfing the wave created by a boat ad but yes I have that's actually I learned you know once you learn how to surf behind a boat and get a certain level of good you can do all sorts of things on it ad and when we were lining it for the first hour of code we try to get all sorts of selfie videos from people saying you know that they had just done the hour of code to make this one compilation video and if you look on youtube for the hour of code is here you'll see a video that has all these little mini little selfies but somebody asked me to sort of while i was wakesurfing to say that i just did the hour of code so i did but then I realized I wasn't anywhere near a computer I'm so didn't come off quite as right so we had to do it again and give me a laptop so I could actually drag block of code and make an angry bird do something um so I'd solved puzzle one of the first hour of code tutorial on a surfboard and you can see it in that video I mentioned so so there is evidence out there so also if you have your webcam you can turn it on and raise your hand if you'd like to speak to hottie and ask a question in the meantime how do we have a question where did the whole idea for code.org come from what inspired you this was this movement has been probably the most sort of not preplanned effort not enough other things like this are planned far in advance but it's kind of a little bit more of an accident than anything else add did I want I've been interested in computer science education for probably 15 years I remember graduating from college and wondering why isn't this a field you know I I'm a journey but I just thought why isn't everybody required to get at least the basic knowledge in this and you know I'm when I was graduating from college was right when the internet it was exploding and web browsers had been invented and so on and it just felt like everything in our lives was going to change this is important and I had that thought and I didn't do anything about it for 15 years but you know three years ago I decided I really should do something about this but I didn't decide I'm gonna start code or guy decided I just make a short youtube video to say that this is an important field that people should try it have enough connections in the tech industry that I managed to recruit some of the best people in the tech industry to participate in the video and my plan was you know I'll make this video and put it on youtube and that's it um the plan got bigger because I realized I can't just put this video in my own YouTube channel like you know and once it has Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg on it it needs like a website and then if it needs a website that website needs a name and my twin brother who was co funding the project with me said you should get the best name possible so we got the name code org and had basically when the original code.org video launched you know my inspiration was this an important field every student should learn this it should be in every school let's put out this video get the word out and then good things will happen and then I'll go back to my sort of cozy little retirement add the video however was so popular that literally 15,000 schools and teachers reached out saying you know this is awesome we want this in our school and there wasn't any this you know it was just a video and me and so I think the real inspiration was just the demand from from educators who thought this is a great idea and they want computer science in their schools and realizing that there's no organization out there that has the capacity or the or the tools to bring something to 15,000 schools at ever since then co.org has been this continuously trying to catch up and keep up with the demand in this space and to effectively give to those teachers and educators what they they tell us that their students wanted need thanks honey we have a question here about the hour of code which is coming up in a couple months um possibly you can't answer but maybe you can speak to other parts of what we have planned the question is do we have any surprise and quotes exciting things planned for this year and what should teachers be looking forward to so the wimpy heads is last year we kind of went pretty all out at you know between getting on an Elsa and a tutorial and getting the president's to participate in the hour of code and having a lucky classroom at literally get taken to the White House to meet the President and the Vice President for like 30 minutes there's no way we can top any of that so and I want to at April just asked about the Pope yeah I want to sort of kind of remove any expectations of us trying to top ourselves each year on this and in fact might we need to quickly shift the hour of code from it's this thing that code org does that is bigger than last year's each year to this thing that just schools and teachers do and you know if you look at something like Earth Day there's no organization that organizes Earth Day people just do stuff and as an organization we at code or we need to figure out how to hand over the reins of different pieces of this to effectively the third the education system and educators to take over it had that said we have some pretty awesome things coming up this year which I can't really tell you about with respect to the Pope in particular add that is I think the only person we can think of add that could either top or equal the president at and I just happen to go to Italy last week for a at four because our partner that really wanted us to meet with them for Italian issues but while we were they they also said that had you know they had independently thought how could get the Pope involved so we're going to make a shot at it if any of you know the Pope please let me know add but there there's definitely a outs we have to get to him so we're going to give it a try you know if there was ever a pope that would consider like writing a line of code it's definitely this poke at that that's certainly for sure at but I have no idea if he's at all interested I have no idea what the process is for booking the coach and but but we're trying from the standpoint by the way of tutorials we have to kick ass awesome tutorials that we're working on em and I don't know if every one of your students have tried all the other of our tutorials so even if it's not the new ones the existing ones are still quite good but we'll have two new ones that are both add over the top and in some ways better than all the ones we've done before and this year we're also soliciting lesson plans from teachers right howdy yes one thing we're actually about to announce this is actually a pretty big deal um but I do want to mention because I just saw on the chat pod that somebody mentioned the Pope wearing the coat or hat and if we get the Pope we're gonna have to design a special white white on white co.org hats just to see if that would be possible for him to wear i'm not sure if it's possible i'm bad but in terms of the teacher in terms of a teacher created lesson plans one thing that the past hours of code have all had is the sense of effectively here's this game tutorial put it in front of your kids hit play they'll learn to code which has been an easy way to get teachers involved especially the teachers who don't know anything because they don't really need to know anything themselves because the thing kind of runs itself at that said it kind of had you know none of us believe that teachers don't need to know anything and there's a lot of teachers who are much better than that but the tutorials we've created don't actually provide an outlet for what should the teacher do other then look over kids shoulders and try to help here and there and there's lots of teachers who would want to have a more traditional lesson plan that they can use and facilitate there's a similar opportunity there's a lot of teachers who don't do the hour of code because they think the hour of code is for the tech teacher rather than for them so we're going to be opening up a call for any teacher who wants to create a lesson plan for the hour of code with a specific call to action which is to try to design it specific to an English teacher or specific to a history teacher or specific to a I don't know algebra teacher geometry teacher at and it can be an unplugged thing or it can be a blood thing and it doesn't need to be a special game featuring you know plants vs zombies it could just be a google doc or whatever at telling a teacher how to facilitate something and you know something that's effectively for the teacher who wants to plan an evening in advance and read through it and learn it and practice it or whatnot you know with 70,000 teachers having done the hour of code I'm sure there's at least 10,000 who would want to go do that and i'm sure there's 10,000 more in other classrooms that would want to do that so hopefully we'll get some really cool lessons and we're going to have a community of teachers that helps us q8 those lessons so any of you here you can help on either side of that if your if your experience whether it's to create lesson plans or to help us sort through the things we get and see which ones are good at that's part of how we'd like to sort of hand over the reins of the hour of code to the broader education community so we're coming down towards the end of our hour here had a just a couple more questions for you a couple of folks in the chat pod asking about our recent on cost analysis that we put out with our evaluation reports if you could talk a little bit towards the funding and and how much it costs to train a teacher and what you think the sustainability of the movement is sure so for anybody who didn't see it we recently announced our analysis of our cost per teacher who we effectively trained at and at the elementary school level our cost is a hundred and fifty dollars per teacher at the middle school level it's a little over two thousand at the high school level it's about forty five hundred dollars per teacher that isn't money that goes to the teacher or it adds up a whole lot of things in some cases actually it includes money that goes to the teacher in middle school in high school in our first cohort of teachers we also paid the full stipend for the teacher to attend PD in elementary school we don't pay stipends for PD F and in middle school in high school over time we'll probably migrate to a model where we don't pay stipends for PT we're already in our new school agreements we're only going to cover half of those costs where we pay it to the district in the district and can pay it out to the teacher um what we look at for the cost is everything that needs to be paid by us for the outcome that we want to happen whether that includes supplies for the PD workshop whether that includes catering for the PD workshop paying the venue paying our own staff whoever it took to even talk to the school district to decide to have a PD workshop in the first place at everything add you know the code org add the reason we do this frankly is because I've looked at this as this is something that our entire country needs which means rather than thinking how do we host a PD workshop for 30 people thinking about it as if we want to train hundreds of thousands of teachers what's it going to cost and how do we bring those elements of cost down because how do we make it not be a billiondollar problem and they can instead be a 400 million dollar problem because a 400 million dollar phone is easier to solve but but we add up all the elements of cost in doing that add to come up with those numbers in terms of the sustainability question basically our view is how to base e hand off add many of those elements of costs to the education system itself you know over the long run schools of Ed or traditional PD providers should be doing the PD and existing PD budgets should pay for it and nobody should be advocating for CS because it just is already there just like nobody advocates for biology and so that's how theoretically which you have sustainability and in the interim we're paying for a whole lot of it until they get there hey so just one last question um what's keeping you up at night what do you think is the next big challenge for code.org to address um thing keeps me up at night just because I'm a stress case and that's just my personality so if it's about one thing it's the next so you know the current things that keep me up at night and that have probably kept me up at night for all the last few years we're always trying to do more than we're set up to do because there's so much opportunity add you know everybody looks at the education system in this country and thanks god there's so many ways it could be better and most people think yeah but that's never going to happen except in this one case of what's happening in computer science it totally is happening and the system is changing and it's not any one organization that's changing its this collective of now tens of thousands of teachers who really care for helping change our school system but a code that over in such a unique position to help and facilitate that change answer every opportunity we have to do something good if we're not doing it stresses me out so you know the fact that we don't yet have a middle school course that's a full year middle school course and that it may be a year until we pilot in two years until we roll it out just dumb and we don't even have the staff to build it yet we need to start hiring for that staff and so on add all of those stress me out because the opportunity for our change is so great and we're always falling short of where we could be we want to thank you so much happy for being open to all these questions is there anything you'd like to say if we close out um the one thing I'd like to say is that ad you know this is kind of the vibe of what I said as well before you know if if you view co.org via our website or our programs we may look like this like Borg like entity that's just kind of solving all these problems for us schools we're a relatively small organization and we very much believe in trying to help find things that solve problem and frankly empowering educators to solve problems themselves if there are things we could do better that you just think hey they're doing this why don't they do it this other way or you know they need as such and such I made it all ready for my own classroom please send them to us at and we'd love to incorporate other people's ideas or creations or so on we definitely can't do everything ourselves and we always look for the community of educators to to help effectively do this for us and thank you all so much for your support and everything you do you know obviously coded or would be nowhere without the work of literally 150 thousand teachers had especially the ones who are in this room would obviously carry enough about it to come to kind of listen to this so thank you so much have a great evening so just a couple closing words before we sign off officially thank you so much to honey for taking the time thank you to all of you for joining us I just wanted to remind you that this is just the first in a series of meetings that we're planning for our teacher communities so we hope to see you next month in October where we're going to dive in deeply and into the results of our evaluation work so on that call you're going to meet Pat young petite is the director of education here at code.org as well as Heather King from outlier are independent evaluator and we're going to talk about some of the challenges and successes that code.org has encountered over the past year and then as i mentioned in november and december will be moving into our code conversations you can find a list of all of the upcoming hangouts and down meetings at code.org / educate flash events and if you register in advance you'll get email reminders as well as an email to the recording after the events of great way to just keep everything organized for yourself you go to the last slide here as howdy mentioned we are really committed to staying connected to our teacher community we've recently launched a twitter handle teach code you'll want to follow that to keep up to date on the latest goingson for the teacher community at code.org we also have teacher blogs at code.org which is a tumblr blog that you can follow and then finally we've launched an online professional learning community forum for teachers which is located at forums at code.org if you go there and log in you'll find threads on everything from our CS fundamentals courses all the way up to some of the questions that on how you talked about today with them regard to the future and funding and things like that that's a great place to check in to communicate with us here at code.org and then also with your fellow teachers so thank you all so much for joining us this recording will be posted soon and we look forward to seeing you in October good night
