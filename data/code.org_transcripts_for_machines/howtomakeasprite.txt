[upbeat music] It's time to dig in to some fun features of Sprite Lab. The first thing to do is to setup a Sprite. To add a Sprite, you can use the "make a new sprite" block. This block lets you give your Sprite a costume and a location. If you want to change the Sprite's location, you can click the pin in the "location" block, and then click where you want it to go. You can change the size of your Sprites too. To make a Sprite smaller, you can use the "set size" block and then type in a number that is less than 100. If you have two or more Sprites with the same costume, this will change all of them at once. Now, let's get the sprite moving by using a behavior. You can start by giving the Sprite the "spinning right" behavior. Once a behavior begins, it will run over and over again forever, or until you tell it to stop. And that's all there is to it. Now it's your turn. [upbeat music fades away]
