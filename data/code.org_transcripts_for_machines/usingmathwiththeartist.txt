If I want to draw a rectangle 50 pixels tall and that is twice as wide as it is tall, how would I program the computer to do that? Well, I could tell the artist to go up fifty, turn right, and then go over 100 and move the whole thing twice. But then I'm doing the math for the computer. Multiplying fifty by two in your head may not that hard but computers are really good at doing math so we should leave it to them whenever possible. If I just used a variable called height instead, then I could easily change height to fifty and then change my algorithm to tell the artist to go up by height, turn right and then go over by height times 2, which gives us a rectangle that is twice as wide as it is tall.
