hi my name is jamila and i write curriculum for code.org software engineers use integrated development environments to write their code an integrated development environment is a software application for writing compiling testing and debugging program code we will use java lab as our ide let's take a look at some of its features in the panel on the left we can find instructions and additional tabs that we will visit throughout the year we can also resize and collapse this panel the settings button lets us switch to dark mode or to light mode when we first access java lab the default name of our file is myclass.java we can rename this file by clicking the arrow and choosing rename let's rename our file to myconsole.java if we need to add a new file to our program we can click the new file button then enter the name of the file we want to create if we have multiple files in our program we can click this folder icon to view them all if we need to delete a file we can click the arrow and choose delete the editor is where we can write our code to run our program we just click the run button at the bottom we have our console the console shows us information about our program and any error messages later we'll learn how to print information to the console and use the console to get input from a user we can also clear the console the version history is useful for when we need to go back to a previous version of our program or to start over the finish button marks the level complete and moves us to the next level since java lab can be accessed from any web browser you can write programs anywhere all you need is an internet connection and your creativity
