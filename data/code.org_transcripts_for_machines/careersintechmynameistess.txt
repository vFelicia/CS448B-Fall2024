ah always a good question what are you guys thinking i let me think about this uh i love computer science because i can build something from like start to finish and make it do something i'm always one of those that has has hand movements and stuff like i don't really sit still i'm really curious i look unique i like to fidget i also love the fact that anything i do does have a lot of impact i'm a software engineer i work on our payment fraud detection team effectively we catch bad guys anytime that you tap buy on your android app or anytime google accepts money we're there to make sure that they don't get away with uh stealing money from our users or google itself we call them fraudsters by the way uh that is actually the official name fraudsters we improve our systems they're improving their systems they're engineers too in a lot of ways and so they'll have like this infrastructure that's attacking us and we'll have this infrastructure that's stopping them and so it's like you get to wake up every day and kind of go like i'm going to catch some people that are bad yes got one yeah guys it's both exciting frustrating and terrifying all at the same time which is you know the way that life has got to be i think when i was like 12 or 13 i do remember the first time i made one of those little lego mindstorms like actually just move it had a little like puzzle piece interface you could do and you just like take these puzzle pieces and tell it like move forward turn left do this kind of do this again with just a few commands i can have this little robot run around the room and search for light once i got that going it was kind of like you sort of expand from there you know then what like a for loop is you know what these other things are and then like from there i was able to kind of move on there's a little bit of breaking your brain to sort of think like a computer because like you are in a lot of ways it's like learning a new language you have to kind of like go okay now i get it i can now think in that that way stick with it it there will be a point where you're kind of like oh i got this now i think i actually understand how this works
