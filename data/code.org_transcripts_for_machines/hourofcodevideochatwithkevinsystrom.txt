oh hi everyone thank you for joining us today for a special hour of code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week joining us this year's Kevin Systrom Kevin is the cofounder and CEO of Instagram of photo sharing app all of us know that millions all over the world use to keep connected so please join me in welcoming Kevin that was the nicest reception I've ever gone thank you we practice all right we're gonna go to school number one West Jefferson middle school in Colorado oh I think you're still muted still muted I can see an icon yeah for encode even if you don't think you'll become a computer programmer yeah of course well first off I have to say I love your bowtie because we have tie Tuesday's here at the office and basically everyone wears ties on Tuesday it's an awesome Tiger eight job okay so awesome question um I think it's important to learn to code because it helps you structure your thinking differently it's kind of like learning math um it's not clear that in the future every day you wake up and you do math problems on a piece of paper but it certainly helps certainly helps you think about the world differently when you're thinking about how to structure a problem how to break up the problem into component parts and then how to sequence your work on that problem I think that's what computer programming helps you do the most for me what's really interesting is I don't do any coding anymore although I wish I did and maybe I'll get back into it for me it really helps because I can talk to engineers and I can talk to designers in the language that they use every single day so even if you're gonna be a designer if you're gonna be a marketing person if you're going to be in PR you need to have a shared and common language with engineers if you're gonna work in Silicon Valley so learning to code also helps you do that I would say those are the two main components awesome so we're gonna move to North Shore Middle School in Wisconsin and they have their entire sixth grade students all in the library so we're gonna have two questions from them how and why do you think Instagram reached so many users so quickly great I'll answer that one I'll answer that one first well the honest truth of it is that it actually took a very very long time for Instagram to get where it is if you count all the days since having the idea to where we are today it's been nearly six years so if you think about it how old were you six years ago that's when Instagram started so you know initially we only had about a hundred people using it and the funny thing is most of those people told us that the app wasn't really going to work not many people would like it that it needed more features that it needed other stuff and and we believed them so we kept working on it but when we launched it worldwide it kind of took off and had 25,000 people sign up the first day I think that's because people really wanted their photos to look interesting because phones at the time I don't know if you guys remember this but the first iPhone the camera wasn't actually all that good so instagrams filters made people's pictures go from being kind of boring and blurry to interesting and artsy and that was a need in the market at the time so people started telling their friends hey if you use this app you can make your photos look really interesting and cool and then over the course of you know six months or so we added a million people to the app which was an astounding number to us and now five years later and and by the way five years is quite a long time we now have over 400 million people using it every single month and for those of you who study geography you'll realize 400 million is a larger number than the number of people in the United States we actually about 70% of the people who use Instagram are overseas and don't use Instagram in English so you really Instagram is is an international network and I think it's scaled back quickly because you don't have to read to use Instagram you don't have to understand English people can connect just because they're seeing each other's images and images are this universal language that everyone speaks or in this case sees I think that's partially why Instagram scaled so quickly even though it took five years what was the second question what was the inspiration for the Instagram logo and the apps various trademarks like the square shaped photo boomerang etc yeah for sure thank you for asking great question so initially I so when you get to college sometimes they allow you to study overseas so they say if you want to take six months you can go study abroad that's called and I decided to study in Italy so I took art history classes and photography classes in Italy and when I was there this was long before Instagram launched I was taking photos with a camera that used square film it was an antique camera called a Holga camera and as I used that I kind of fell in love with the square aesthetic the square aspect ratio of film because it was a lot easier to frame things and it was easier to make a goodlooking photo with square and filters actually came from the idea that when I was developing the film the way you used to do it was that you actually shined a light through the film onto a piece of paper and then put that paper in chemicals to develop the print and you could change the colors by adding extra chemicals to that chemical bath and it would kind of shift the colors so square photos on Instagram came from that camera and then filters came from that process in the darkroom of being able to add chemicals and change and shift the colors and when we designed the icon the icon came from wanting to feel like an old vintage camera and it was kind of ironic because the most new most advanced cameras were the cell phones people were holding in their hands and we wanted to be the opposite of that we wanted to be cool and retro and vintage so we looked at a bunch of really old cameras back in the day and kind of borrowed elements from all of them and we made an icon out of it and still to this day people think of Instagram is kind of cool and vintage and and hip or at least I hope you guys do thank you for the question let's take our next question from st. Isidore school in California it would be really cool to work for Instagram what type of personality traits do you look for when you're hiring Wow good question on well number one you got a you know graduate from college so you guys have a few years we we look for really really smart folks so we look for people that are driven and you have a demonstrated ability to create things so oftentimes what we look for are people that throughout the last few years have been working on projects at home they've launched their own apps they've had ideas for what they want to build and they've done these oneoff projects because it shows an entrepreneurial spirit and you have to be really smart and sharp to learn the skills to be able to do everything from think up the idea to code the idea to design the idea and then to launch the idea so we often look for that in people um we also look for a humility um and humility means not being prideful not being too boastful it's about being a team player and always trying to boost the work of others on your team rather than boost yourself I think that's one of the most important qualities as well and just being a hard worker I mean as you know in school the people who are best in your class are often the people who study the most and that's true here at work the people who do the best work are often the people who work the hardest because you know to launch an apt this many people and to have great ideas you really have to put in a bunch of time and effort but I'd say maybe the most important personality quality would be to be nice we look for really nice people people who have smiles on their faces people who make everyone's day a little bit brighter and if you can do that you're what we call a culture fit and we like to hire you in here so graduate college work really hard and have ideas and be really nice those are the things thank you for asking awesome set of qualities let's take our next question from Fairhope high in Alabama if Instagram hadn't become popular what do you think you would be doing now um that's a good question I haven't really thought that through the good news is Instagram didn't become popular so I get to do this job which is my favorite job on earth but if it didn't become popular what I was doing at the time was teaching myself to code and working on startups and honestly I would probably be working at maybe another version of Instagram as an employee Silicon Valley is pretty awesome because there are tons of people with new ideas every single week and they always try to get people to work on their teams and launch new ideas so I'd probably be working at a startup I'd probably do my best to be an engineer there or a designer and maybe if I was lucky that startup would affect as many people as Instagram was but I'd be just as happy doing that as as Instagram because you know working on ideas that touch millions of lives is kind of the dream of everyone here in Silicon Valley and the cool part is you've got a ton of folks here doing that every single day so that's probably what I'd be doing let's take our last classroom question from tanana middle school in Alaska nice and what about a program or another social network that you've never released a program that I've never used um you know I try to keep up with all the acts that launch you guys are actually the best at doing this so whenever I hear about a new app or a new social network I'll hear about it from my cousins who are 11 13 and 15 because it turns out you guys are like the pulse of what's happening online and you probably don't even know that you know things like like snapchat and photo and flip program and a bunch of these other apps that kind of have become popular all started with fairly young folks and over time grew and became really popular you guys are a little young to remember this but there was a day when Facebook didn't even exist and it started at colleges actually and it started with students and students you know used it before any grownup did and then they launched in high schools and then they released it to everyone but there was a time when only college and high school students actually could use it um so when I think about experiencing new apps that I've never used before I often asked my young cousins what they use and they always surprise me but um I love going to the App Store and downloading games from the charts I look what's popular and see what's new I love music apps I love games I love apps that let you change your photos those are all the things that I focus on and if you have any ideas feel free to send them to me great so we have a couple of questions from Twitter and Kate is going to ask them hello so our first question that we got from Twitter is how do you measure the success of something you're involved in is it money or you or innovation or help longevity how do you measure your success uh I think it depends on the person but I think it's a little bit of everything you just mentioned because they're all kind of tied up with each other but at the end of the day what matters most is like whether or not you feel fulfilled and for some people that's you know doing something positive in the world and changing people's lives for the better for some people they really want to build a company and have lots of employees for some people they want to make a living so that they can send their kids to college and so that they can you know um give philanthropically I think it really depends on each individual person but I think when you start an idea or when you start a company or when you start you know working somewhere you should always ask yourself wha I used to ask yourself am I here because I want to make a difference am I here because I want to make a paycheck am I here because I want to learn and be really clear about your intentions because then at the end of the day you can ask yourself if you're actually meeting those goals or not for me Instagram actually initially it was just because I wanted to work on my own and I wanted to have ideas and actually see them through and I wanted to learn the code and I did that through Instagram as well I wanted to work in social media and I wanted to see if we could create a service that lots of people enjoyed and the crazy thing is over the last five to six years we've done all of those things and it's just grown to an enormous height and even now we ask ourselves okay what do we want to do in the next year I'm like how do we want to judge ourselves at the end of 2016 is it creating a business that makes a lot of revenue is it creating a business that touches many more millions of lives around the world and we keep asking ourselves those questions every year to make sure that we're headed in the right direction and I think everyone should do that whether you're a student an employee or a founder excellent answer and then we have our final question also from Twitter can you tell us about a program or a product that you worked on but that you never released to the public yeah they're actually um well I released it to the public but it didn't really go so well so um when I was in college I noticed a bunch of people in their dorm rooms they have stuff at the end of the year that they want to give away and I also noticed people want to buy things like fridges they want to buy mattresses they want to buy posters for their walls to decorate and there's this disconnect between people there was no market place so I I made something called that it was called swap swap actually and the idea is that you would swap goods with other people on college campuses and I actually did launch it and only about 200 people ever used it so it wasn't exactly successful it was a it was a small success compared to what Instagram ended up being but it taught me a lot and that's why I actually think you know forget about like how much money a company makes or how many people it touches every single experience in your life I think helps you learn for the next experience or the next challenge down the road so sometimes you know I would get bummed when I launched something and no one used it but looking back had I not done those things had I not had those failures we wouldn't have learned the really important lessons that actually ended up making Instagram successful and even today at Instagram I mean not everything is perfect I mean we have mistakes that we make we launch things that no one uses and we need to tweak them and make them better so always looking at mistakes or failures in the light of an opportunity to learn for the next time around I think that's probably the most important lesson I've learned over the years oh thank you so much Kevin for joining us today and inspiring students around the world to study computer science we appreciate you spending time answering these questions and sharing a little bit about your experience both impact technology can have on our lives so everyone let's thank heaven for joining us today
