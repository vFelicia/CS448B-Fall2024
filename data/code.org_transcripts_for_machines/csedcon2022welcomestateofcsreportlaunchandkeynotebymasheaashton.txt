I want to share a few words about our Collective need to reignite the movement for computer science because we've had now three years of a hunkering down through school closures and economic challenges and during the last two years it has not been easy to tell schools that it's time to teach computer science almost anybody doing this work has been like yeah we want to do that but we also need to like figure out how to deal with covet and masks and school closures and zoom and all these other things and that was this new school year begins for all of us that care about the movement for growing computer science in schools one of our top challenges is to make sure administrators leaders School leaders teachers classrooms reignites the interest in teaching computer science in every school and to every child and this is not easy because schools still have so many challenges just trying to reopen dealing with teacher shortages and getting the system back going again I want to talk briefly about something we did this past July that just shows how potent and Powerful the interest in computer science is not only in this country in the United States but in a way that I think has Global resonance back in January the national Governors Association which basically hosts the annual Gathering of the 50 United States Governors decided under the leadership of Arkansas governor ASA Hutchinson to to create a Governor's compact to come together to collectively make a statement in support of computer science and when that happened we had code.org decided if the governors are going to do this we need to bring the private sector as well to get corporate leaders and nonprofit leaders to come together with our government leaders to all say that computer science is important for every child and you know I started recruiting folks from the tech companies and so we we eventually and unsurprisingly got the leaders of the largest tech companies whether it's Apple Microsoft Google and Amazon Facebook and many many many other technology companies to all collectively sign a statement but what was most unique was what we came together when this when this finally launched was not only the technology companies but the largest companies in every single sector of Industry whether it's the largest Airlines the largest phone companies coffee companies like Starbucks shoe companies like Nike Walgreens UPS Walmart you name it all came together behind the idea that computer science needs to be part of the curriculum and not only did these employers representing millions and millions of jobs agreed to to come behind this nonprofits and nonprofit leaders from the College Board to Khan Academy and also the two largest teacher unions in the country came behind the same statement and at and then the next day 50 Governors 45 State Governors plus five territories collectively also signed a statement basically saying that in the United States we need to move to a world where computer science is available and every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science and this Collective coming together of Business Leaders nonprofit leaders government leaders when you sue billion billionaires and unions coming together tech companies who are competitors coming together and groups from every Walk of Life and then Democrat and Republican Governors coming together we showed that computer science is important and we also showed that the United States of America can act United on an issue that is important to our future and what happened is not only did we make this statement every one of these CEOs then tweeted this statement creating a global awareness and all around the world other people said why isn't our country doing this too and this shows that the movement to teach computer science is important and it's important globally it is something we all care about here and as we think about basically the bounce back after the pandemic it's on all of us to share that excitement and to reignite interest in this movement the computer science education movement did not have its best last two years it's been hard because almost everything in education didn't have its best last two years but the rest of this decade are going to be the best years for computer science when we look back at the end of this decade I'm quite confident that we will have reached the points where in the United States every single student has access to computer science in their schools and in Most states it will be mandatory for high school graduation and since there are so many Global computer science leaders here I expect that as we do that in this country many many other countries will be doing the same thing some of them ahead of the United States some of them behind the United States but our goal by the end of this decade should be to have at least 50 countries where every student has access and every student is learning computer science as part of a requirement for high school graduation and so I'm so excited to welcome you here today I I want to let us get along with the agenda we have a packed agenda with some amazing speakers thank you for being here thank you for everything you all do behind this movement for computer science for every student I next want to introduce Lisa Dr Lisa milankovic from Broward County Broward county is the first school district in the United States to adopt computer science in every school and they are the sixth largest District Dr milankovic has been this stem and computer science supervisor and a partner for code.org since our very first year give her a warm Round of Applause and thank you so much I want to welcome you to thank you first of all good morning I am the supervisor of stem and computer science in the applied learning Department with all the other electives but we're more than an elective in computer science and I'll share a little bit of information about that Broward County Public Schools is the nation's sixth largest District and through Partnerships both internal within the district large district and external we have grown computer science from 66 students that took the AP test in 2012. and and very unsuccessful failure of an NSF proposal to try to bring computer science across the whole District to a communitywide culture shift that now supports computer science for all and thanks in part a big part to the partnership in 2013 of code.org coming to our district and kind of saying that they wanted to do everything that the failure of an NSF proposal was going to do and more and then internal collaboration across many departments in Broward schools through CTE and learning departments and I.T and a bunch of different departments have worked on this and our schools itself getting the administration on board and the community with our stem ecosystem and our business Community who volunteers for hour of code and be and along with other days in the classroom and have hackathons and enrichment activities so students know how do they can apply their computer science we have reached thousands of teachers now and their students and I think yesterday when we looked in Tableau we found out that we were reaching more than a hundred thousand students have been reached by our teachers over the years and we couldn't do that without the support of code.org and the National Science Foundation in partnership with our research Partners at University of Chicago University of Florida MIT and digital promise and prior support we've received from Google and the current funding from the state of Florida and of course code.org we've been able to sustain and grow computer science beyond what is typically thought of as CS teachers because we're still at a hundred thousand students not reaching all over 266 000 students in our district we have now trained media Specialists music and art and PE teachers to be computer science teachers as well PE teachers are making fitbits out of micro bits and other wearable devices and having fun with it students are creating with computer science social studies teachers ELA teachers are emphasizing sympathy and computer science for social good through learning about artificial intelligence and digital citizenship and why that's important in ethics and we have initial training for over 2 000 teachers we have 14 000 teachers to go so still working on that and now every student has the opportunity to learn and apply computer science to solve problems so we're getting there but we're not quite there yet and we welcome you to Broward County and to Sunny Fort Lauderdale beach and enjoy your time here I want to start with who's at CS edcon we have 350 participants this year this year we have 50 over 50 people from outside the U.S representing 32 countries countries such as Spain Brazil Chile Thailand Kazakhstan Maldives and Myanmar from the U.S we have 48 states represented including 25 from Florida plus DC the U.S Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and actually I wanted to mention that unfortunately some of our um participants participants from Puerto Rico couldn't attend because obviously the impact of the hurricane uh this session is actually going to be recorded and put on YouTube later so just to our Puerto Rican colleagues you know our hearts are with you we're thinking about you we miss you so many people here are involved in leading District regional state or national initiatives what we brought together at CS edcon are really the the movers and shakers All Around the World in terms of Computer Science Education there are over 200 CEOs directors vice presidents principals superintendents and 150 State Education Agency staff local Education Agency staff Regional staff researchers leaders of nonprofits and Industry Representatives the most special thing about CS edcon are the people and so I want to start out by talking about some of these people and introducing them they don't know that their pictures are about to show up on these slides so we'll start out with zomira May zamira is an education specialist for UNESCO and she'll be moderating a panel on computer science efforts around the world Alan Antoine is the associate director for mathematics and computer science at the Rice University Office of stem engagement Anton will be leading a conversation session on how to increase the participation of black teachers and students Lauren marzillo is an associate professor at Georgia State Lawrence is going to talk about how to teach CS to all preservice education students preservice education teachers Shauna young is the executive director for the scratch Foundation you you all have heard of scratch right she's the executive director for the scratch foundation and we'll be talking about emerging Tech Trends and Innovations in computer science foreign is the associate director of technology and Innovation at actsorn in Thailand a corn is the person to talk to if you're going to be training thousands of teachers over the next couple of years because they've done that in Thailand um in Thailand if you don't know they require computer science every single year every single grade and pecoran had to lead that effort to train all those teachers dimitro zagavrovni is the director general for digital transformation at the Ministry of Education and science of Ukraine talk to dimitro about expanding Computer Science Education in very trying times and dimitro wherever you are out there you know our hearts definitely go out to you and the people of Ukraine during this time so we are so delighted to have you here dimitro will actually be speaking a little bit about uh uh the work in Ukraine uh tomorrow is the global correct coordinator for Africa code week and we'll be talking about raising awareness for computer science across the continent Diana gilhouse is a research fellow at the center for security and emerging technology at Georgetown University and we'll be talking about the workforce and education landscape for AI and cyber security Kathy deerenwater is the chief program officer for the American Indian science and engineering Society and we'll be talking about CS education for indigenous learners and last but not least Maya Israel is an associate professor at the University of Florida and we'll be talking about making CS more inclusive for all students with disabilities whether academic or physical disabilities these are just some of the people I want you to meet as you walk the hallways and the sessions at CS edcon I could go on and on and pick lots of different people but that's why we have a networking session later today as well as a reception this evening I did want to give a special shout out to all of our state superintendents commissioners of Public Instruction and secretaries of Education in attendance today let's give them a round of applause getting 12 State Chiefs on stage for any issue let alone computer science is a very special thing we are delighted to have you all here today now I'd like to introduce you to Sean Roberts code.org vice president of government Affairs Sean thanks thank you Pat and uh welcome to the state of computer science I am so glad that this report is here this year it's really a foundational part of what we do at code.org and we're grateful for the partners we have in supporting us I'm going to actually ask you to do something a little bit different from maybe other talks you're at and please take out your phones um you can take them out uh both because we're going to need them here in just a few moments but also there's like 30 chance I might fall off the end of the stage with the lights here and that would make a great Tick Tock so feel free to take them out for that also as you're taking pictures you know feel free I'll give you a couple poses here to get started this is me making a real Salient point on the state of computer science here's me dealing with a Heckler in the front row all right um okay as I said uh great to be here great to talk about the state of Cs report uh with you all this year um very glad to have uh the partners we we do we've seen tremendous growth in in state policy in making computer science a requirement for graduation and this year's report addresses some of those early results we've seen and provide some recommendation and guidance around it so I'm going to get into that a little bit before we move on to our coauthors who are also joining me up here but first I want to thank everyone who made this report possible including all of you the work you do in your communities and districts and states the state of computer science is a collaborative effort between us at code.org the computer science Teachers Association and expanding Computing education Pathways this year's report was made possible by cognizant and our supporters of Computer Science Education please give those organizations uh this is the sixth year of the state of Cs report and one of the things we wanted to do is take a step back and reframe the foundational nature of computer science looking back we've come an extremely long way in the past five years so in 2017 just seven states across the U.S had standards for Computer Science Education just seven five years later 43 states have standards for Computer Science Education it's hard to believe and beyond that 27 States now require schools to teach computer science think about that for a second yeah five years ago only seven states even defined computer science now we're at a point where the majority of States think it's so important that it has to be taught in their schools let's take a moment to celebrate that how about a hand for our students parents teachers principals districts and state that have made this possible and let's spread the word about this let's get this going so there's a QR code this is where you can use your phone and if you can scan the code and let's help spread the word about this milestone in the state of Cs report in your communities and nationally so if you have Twitter take out your phone it'll lead you to a tweet that you can retweet and we can let people know that the majority of States now require computer science in their schools if this is possible to achieve in five years so as we talked about you know we had seven states that defined computer science and now we're at the majority of States requiring it in their schools if we could accomplish that in five years I'm really excited to see what the next five years could bring stronger scores and reading and math as we know that computer science correlates with better test scores and reading and Math and Science and dozens of Studies have shown what if every high school student in the country had a fundamental understanding of how the algorithms that influence and are shaping their lives every day are working unfortunately not every student has that opportunity today we have more schools than ever offering computer science courses but is it really Equitable access when only 32 percent of our students are young women this trend also continues at the postsecondary level as well more CS degrees are being awarded than ever but women share of those degrees are increasing only incrementally and this continues postgraduation too at the current rate it would take over 100 years for computing jobs to achieve balanced gender representation of course this isn't just about tech jobs it's the foundational nature of computer science that students will need to thrive regardless of their future courses of study or their careers but it starts in our schools certainly and the work you all do what if there was a way we could accelerate that growth well these states have South Carolina Maryland and Mississippi are the only states in the country to have achieved above 40 percent participation by young women in computer science courses how have they done that well you might guess they each have some form of requirement for computer science Maryland and Mississippi have computer science or technology requirements and most of those courses above 90 percent of those courses are computer science South Carolina instituted their graduation requirement and had more young women take a computer science course this year than North Carolina Florida Alabama and Georgia combined they're about the same number of young women taking a computer science course this year in South Carolina than there are in the entire state of Texas Texas is a population of about 30 million South Carolina is about 5 million and what's more is a funny thing happening in South Carolina after the computer science graduation requirement went into effect graduation rates have actually gone up eliminating gender disparities in high school computer science access is no longer a 20year incremental issue where hopefully we'll make progress and we won't plateau and we'll see small stepbystep progress it's achievable in five years as these states have shown computer science is necessary it engages students and their academics and supports learning in other subjects that's what we want out of graduation requirements and states are recognizing this five states across the country now require students to take computer science for graduation Tennessee Nebraska and Arkansas all pass theirs recently and those states are scheduled to begin implementing over the next few years when they'll join South Carolina and Nevada at a point where every student will learn computer science we'll have more sessions and discussions on this over the next few days to talk about what we've seen in these states we'll hear from some of these states we'll hear from students and their experience and why computer science makes sense as a graduation requirement policy makers Advocates and education leaders have to make this a priority though see computer science is a graduation requirement isn't an ending that's not the end goal like we get there in these states and then we're done as I'm sure these states will tell you but it's a beginning step toward ensuring students have the foundational skills that they'll need it's a responsibility that's up to all of us and of course this isn't possible without teachers in the classroom it being a beginning then it's going to be up to teachers and we're going to rely on teachers to continue to make sure students are getting high quality Computer Science Education instruction that's why we're honored to coauthor the report with the computer science Teachers Association so please join me in welcoming one of my fellow coauthors Jake Baskin executive director of the computer science Teachers Association I owe someone a drink tonight um thanks Sean thanks for setting the stage for that and welcoming amount welcoming me on stage and before I jump in I want to just take a second and give a shout out to past csta board member Janice Mack although her term on the board just came to an end in July she's continued to serve our organization by Leading our contributions to this report over the last several months so I just want to say a huge thank you to Janice for all of your work on this report let's give her a round of applause now Sean you've made a pretty compelling case for the impact of States implementing a graduation requirement it's really clear to me from the data that you've shown and what we see in the report that these states have seen a dramatic shift in who takes at least one computer science course and especially a shift in how young women and nonbinary students engage in CS but before everyone in this room walks away thinking this is going to be easy I'll just make it CS graduation requirement next year I want to take a moment and recognize that none of these changes would be possible without one key group the amazing computer science teachers that bring these courses to life in fact at csta we know from our reach to the teacher census that among computer science teachers there's strong support for states to enact graduation requirements when implemented thoughtfully and that thoughtfully part is important here from this year's report we know that still only 53 percent of schools offer even one foundational computer science course and just 5.6 percent of students took a computer science course last year in order to make graduation requirements a reality we're going to need to see those numbers change dramatically and states are going to need to get serious about investing in teacher development with an eye towards career long support in fact we've been talking a lot about South Carolina this morning and at csta we're really proud of the work we've done with our South Carolina chapter the Department of Education and the Citadel to support teachers with an annual cspd week event for the past three years where each summer hundreds of teachers have come together to learn not only how to start teaching CS but to continue to deepen their understanding of how to teach equitably and inclusively in the Cs classroom year after year and as everyone in this room begins to plan for things like graduation requirements or other new policies in your state I want you to know that csta is here to help with keyword resources that all policy makers and state department staff should be aware of beyond the work we do directly with teachers in every one of your States we have brought the community together to define the characteristics of high quality Computer Science teaching through the csta standards for CS teachers we have a regularly updated list of accredited professional development providers and opportunities that support teachers in meeting these standards and working towards implementing high quality inclusive and Equitable Computer Science teaching in their classrooms and we verified curricular alignments to the csta standards for K12 computer science which nearly everyone in this room has used as the base for your own state standards for CS all of these tools are key to ensuring that when CS graduation requirements are implemented they don't become just another computer science class in name only and making sure that your students your teachers are receiving the high quality support that they and their students deserve because at the end of the day as I said to start this teachers are the key to making sure that all students not only have access to but are engaging in and succeeding in a foundational K12 CS education and I for one cannot wait to welcome the next wave of computer science teachers to our world's largest computer science department so next I'm looking forward to turning it over to Josh Childs from esep to share a little bit more about some specific State policy Trends thanks everyone thank you Jake yo someone else to drink uh before I begin talking about uh policy Trends I want to give a special shout out to Dr Carol Fletcher and Sarah Dunn part of our esep team that have helped lead the efforts around producing the reports so thank you to very much for the efforts you did in this so there's a lot to be excited about there's a lot of positivity moving in States and there's some current policy Trends I want to talk about that I think can help lead us over the next few days in an incoming year upcoming year when it comes to Computer Science Education so let's look about back over the last five years since 2017 we've seen increases in things such as state level funding for computer science increases in state plans for K12 computer science and most importantly high schools requiring to provide Computer Science Education in five years the work of State leaders District level leaders Community efforts families have led to these increases that we are seeing across the country today that's something to be excited about but some that deserves a round of applause not now and why I say not now is the work is not done there's more work that needs to that is required and more states that we have to see increase efforts around computer science education and hopefully that will be our goal over the next year and years to come so I want to highlight two states Kentucky for one Kentucky in the house there we go I'm sorry not in the house and Pat's house my apologies and Pat's house so Kentucky centering equity producing uh uh our annual report that measures the Equitable outcomes and participation of students in computer science education to see where they're missing the mark and seeing what needs to be done to provide resources and strategies to see improvements and increases in computer science education participation and then Louisiana Louisiana where you at there we go there we go let the good times roll Louisiana that's Double Down efforts and provided recommendations around professional development of teachers and thinking about ways in which again how do we increase access and participation of our students in computer science education these are just two states that are in the report that you can learn from and see what they've done over the last year to see how they've thought about increasing access and participation pure science and then how do we learn from States like Indiana that have done marvelous jobs around implementation and thinking about ways in which they can get 91 of their students to attend at least a high school attend who attended high school that offers a foundational uh computer science course so how do we learn from one another how do we learn from other states when it comes to improving Computer Science Education even there are important questions that we need to ask as we move forward in this work and so I have four of them here from a cape framework that we've used over the last several years to think about how do we Center and move in Equitable ways so that students all students no matter background no more the family they come from no matter what their communities are that they can also have the opportunities to experience what can come from Computer Science Education questions like do districts in all areas have the resources to offer CS to train and certify teachers and what would that look like RCS courses offered in lowincome schools at similar rates to other schools are we doing enough to make sure that everyone has access which subgroups are underrepresented in our CS courses who's missing there are opportunities that exist there and how we flip the narrative not from a deficit perspective of these students but how do we think about the opportunities they provide by attending and being part of our CS classrooms and finally how does the quality instruction differ across subgroups of students and how does that affect learning and speaking from a state level perspective how do we equip and Empower our state leaders invested in our state houses or state Departments of Education to continue to support and dive in and provide resources around CS education there's a lot to be excited about there's also a lot more work to do and I hope you'll join all of us in helping move this work forward thank you thanks please reach out to us if with any questions about the report as you're going through uh thank you for your support of computer science please share the report far and wide hard copies are available if you didn't get one already hard copies are available out by registration so please pick one up if you haven't received one this year's report reflects continued progress in computer science education through the work and support of teachers as we heard from Jake and an advancing State policies as we heard from Josh it also provides us with a sobering reminder of how far we have to go but thanks to the leading States in computer science we know that our shared vision of every student in every school having the opportunity to learn computer science is not wishful thinking decades from now we do however have to act on that opportunity and that time is now thank you all I want to introduce to the stage Dr Christina Grant the state superintendent of education for Washington D.C good morning oh we can do better than that good morning too many Educators in the room to not have a good good morning I bring you greetings from the nation's capital Washington DC uh it is I'm geeked out to be here because it is always a joy as a state chief to be able to celebrate one of your schools and um there's an amazing story that I hope you hear more about this school but the joy of my morning is to tell you about one of my students and so Quran Owens has attended D.C public schools his entire life he's an honor roll student he's one of 540 Scholars from Southeast DC who has chosen to enroll in a public charter school digital Pioneers Academy remember that name thunders in the room remember that name anyone who wants to move to DC remember that name but the important part of the school is that is explicitly focused on computer science and computer science education Quran and his classmates are by Design Pioneers they embody the spirit of the school the spirit of our values in Washington DC and they are forging a path for Computer Science Education that will transform their Futures transform our district and transform the world digital Pioneers Academy is unapologetically committed to ensuring our students are prepared for college that they are grounded in high quality instructions in computer science and that they receive an entire whole rounded education for all of their students please join me send him a lot of love this is very hard for adults to do and so one could imagine that he may be a little nervous but please welcome to the stage digital Pioneers Academy's founding scholar Quran Owens you got this uh good morning I'm Karan Owens from Southeast Washington DC I'm the oldest of my siblings and love attending digital Pioneers Academy because of the schools Computer Science Focus in our caring teachers I enjoy creating and building and quoting an anime when I graduate from DPA I want to earn a full scholarship to a top 10 school for Esports and prepare for a career as a coder I also want to volunteer as a mentor to Young students in computer science and create virtual reality experiences like Dungeons and Dragons I am very excited to introduce our school founder and leader Michelle Ashton the thing I appreciate most about Miss Ashton is that she really knows me and cares about my growth and happiness I am grateful to go to a school where I feel known loved and respected which is a key part of our culture my experience is that DPA is a school that really lives its values which are accountability growth ownership optimism Innovation and empathy performance as an open Digital Pioneers Academy in 2018 she spent over two decades working to improve Urban education across the country most recently as CEO of the Newark Charter School fund Miss Ashton graduated from William and Mary College and began her career as a special education teacher in my hometown of southeast Washington DC she also understands what it means to be a middle school student firsthand she is the parent of twin sixth graders please welcome my principal Ms Ashton Quran a round of applause my heart is so warm thank you Quran good morning everyone I am so excited to be here at Cs edcon and to get this opportunity to speak to a room full of Educators and policy leaders who share my passion for computer science and education at my school we send snaps if something I say resonates with you if I start struggling up here you can send me some magic I'll take all the magic all the snaps my journey um to founding a computer science focused School began way back when I was growing up in New Jersey I met my New Jersey people I think they were back here woohoo any Eagles fans Fly Eagles Fly okay okay so I'm focused I'm focused all right so one of the pivotal moments in my life happened in a small conference room at my elementary school the principal had convened a little meeting to share the news that my sister and I had failed the school year and we would need to repeat the grade to this day I remember the look of anger in my mom's eyes this did not happen in third or fourth grade my identical twin sister and I were in kindergarten yes and you won't know anything about kindergarten kids are not supposed to fail kindergarten I must have just colored Outside the Lines or broke all the rules I'm still kind of doing that but anyway failing kindergarten impacted my direction and my career in two very important ways the first is it exposed me to school choice I believe that parents should have a choice and if you look at my resume you'll see that I'm the crazy Charter School person and I want to just tell you right now there are some good charter schools and there are some bad charter schools there are some good traditional public schools and there are some bad traditional Public Schools what I know is our parents want Great Schools regardless of the title and the name but once my mom learned that they plan to hold my sister and I back she searched and worked diligently to until she found another school that would meet our needs my parents knew the school what we were assigned to was not a good fit and they had the agency or maybe the audacity and they knew they had the agency to find something better for their children I believe that every family and every scholar deserves that in Washington DC students have that choice more than half of our students who attend Polk School are either enrolled in a traditional public school or a public charter school for Charter Schools they apply and they are they get in through a lottery every family and every scholar deserves this opportunity the second impact failing kindergarten had on me it is that it is it forever altered the perception I had of myself at an early age I was told that I was not smart a school that creates that feeling in a child is it a school that any child should attend I would never want my own children Duke and Dylan who are twins starting Middle School to have this experience and if it is not acceptable for my kids it is not acceptable for anyone's kids in case you are wondering spoiler alert I turned out okay in fact my sister and I found our way through Elementary School we were successful in school and Athletics we were both the first AfricanAmerican women soccer players at the College of William and Mary yes she I went on to grad school at William Mary she went on to grad school at Harvard so I think back to that kindergarten teacher I know her name I have a picture I haven't hunted her down yet she just made a mistake we all fail sometimes and in fact I graduated from college and I got my first job as a special education teacher at Ian beers Elementary right in Washington DC but after teaching I spent 15 years working for various roles in leadership all across the country including the CEO of the Newark Charter School fund but my family moved back to Washington DC in 2016 to be closer to family but professionally I wasn't exactly sure what I would do next and this is where computer science enters my life one day I promise you I read one article about how Innovation is changing the world economy in ways that were unimaginable a decade ago this fourth Industrial Revolution based on technological advances in artificial intelligence robotics biotechnology in which transforming how we live and how we work today and how our children live and how they will work in the future in DC I read that there were 10 000 vacancies for HighTech highpaying jobs in the metro area that would pay a salary of over a hundred thousand dollars that's real money y'all and to put that salary in perspective at our school 98 of our Scholars are eligible for free and reduced lunch to qualify in D.C a family of four has to make less than fifty one thousand dollars these aren't just jobs these are careers and they are careers that can break the cycle of poverty and build generational wealth an opportunity that black and brown families have not had due to years of systemic racism and oppression this realization fundamentally shifted my perspective about the importance of computer science education for students especially for low income and workingclass Families I now believe that computer science should be a course that begins as early as Elementary School it's snap if you agree because I think this is the room that agrees it should be a core subject like math and eoa snap if you agree it should be a core class not just an elective snap if you agree it should be a core class not just an afterschool program snap if you agree it should be a high school graduation requirement snap if you agree a computer science education should not be for just kids who attend affluent private schools or Suburban schools it should be for all students CS for all for real snap if you agree as in many of our nation cities in DC there is a huge gap between those who are prepared for this rapidly evolving economy and those who are not digital Pioneers Academy operates in one of the most underresourced communities in Washington DC in Ward 7 and 8. the unemployment rate in these areas was nearly three times the national average in only 1 in 10 adults have attained a college degree I think this is similar for many cities across the country but for me I find myself grappling with this dichotomy incredible career opportunities for young people in our city and many many young people in my city who look like me who are not being adequately educated for these jobs and these opportunities that did not sit well with me at all it actually didn't just sit poorly it felt like a call to action every child in DC should have the opportunity to pursue one of these highpaying high demand jobs and have the schooling to prepare them to excel at one of those jobs so what was I going to do about it I fought back to my own experience my parents were able to find the right school for my sister and I to Excel and to be prepared to do whatever career we hope to pursue every parent should have the ability to do that for their child snap if you agree okay so here I was it was 2017 and the idea for digital Pioneers Academy was born in the months after that I developed a 500 page yes 500 page Charter application that outlined this vision for a computer science immersion school where every child would take computer science and we adopted a curriculum that emphasized computational thinking skills like problem solving collaboration and critical thinking we had this amazing Mission around developing the next generation of innovators but I needed to Define innovation we came up with this innovators think thoughtfully creatively and critically about solving complex problems and this is a complex problems problem and there were three things that we needed to do to figure out how we were going to offer our kids from Southeast Washington DC a rigorous computer science experience Talent curriculum and culture on Talent we needed a strategy to recruit retain and train our best teachers when I developed the idea of DPA at that time there were there were no schools that I could find that required computer science as a core part of the program and a story I always tell is I actually went to csta that's where I met Pat and I was looking for all the computer science teachers I was going to steal them from all of your places I was gonna lure them to to DC to have helped found the school that we were going to change the world and guess what I found a whole bunch of Math teachers science teachers social studies teachers who love computer science and we're teaching and learning computer science along with our Scholars and I thought man this is a real problem and it's a tremendous opportunity the Second Challenge we had was curriculum we had to bag borrow and steal from the best because that's what innovators do so we decided early on that we were not going to be curriculum experts while we navigate the founding of a CS immersion school we would let co.org and code HS and others figure out the curriculum page in fact we decide to partner with Republic in in Tennessee and we use code.org to supplement our Middle School rigorous curriculum Fifth Third piece and this is really important we had to figure out the culture we had to live our values of empathy and growth at DPA when we say growth we mean fat ass play along with me failure and difficulty is opportunity for growth and feedback fat ass that's what we mean you fail a lot in computer science we had to get our Scholars with the right mindset that failing and failing forward is what great computer scientists do our value on empathy was around creating this known love respected community our Scholars had to feel safe to take risks and to share their ideas we are trying to change history and prove that all kids but particularly kids from the most underresourced parts of our city can be the next generation of innovators that they can change the face of Technology with 83 percent of our Tech Executives being white we have to do more if we are going to change that data our kids have to feel confident they have to feel safe they have to believe that they can be computer scientists you have to create a school that feels that the biggest obstacle to taking computer science then isn't just our teachers teaching computer science it includes this aspect this confidence and this opportunity students have to believe that they can have these jobs this goes for students of color women students in rural communities and underresourced communities everyone a school that focuses on computer science tries to bridge all of these gaps at the end of the day we believe that DPA is proving that a school like ours should exist for all Scholars but particularly for those who come for our utmost under resource communities okay I have just a couple more points if this is great you can blame Pat if it's bad you can blame Pat too so I'm just going to say this is his house my last point so going back to when I prepared to open DPA I visited various elementary schools to share with students and parents about our school and our mission to develop the next generation of innovators I distinctly remember visiting Ketchum Elementary and meeting Quran and his mom who's here with us today as they were considering yes give a shout out to Quran and his mom I also happy with me two of my Scholars Ms Fields and Jasmine are here as well when I talk to them about computer science and coding and Robotics quran's mom said to me this is the perfect school for my son DPA represented a new school choice option for Quran and students in the area one that was focused on computer science had smaller classes and is committed to a culture of every scholar and every staff feeling known loved and respected we opened our doors with 120 scholars in Fall of 2018. our incredible team of Educators and leaders had dedicated themselves to our students and having them be creators in this digital world not just consumers we may have students who will contribute to technology needing to send people to Mars sitting in Miss Harding's class right now I firmly believe that I have Scholars who will become household names founding the next Dell or apple or next Google or the next Tick Tock or SnapChat they are they are at digital Pioneers Academy I believe it I had the faith that these dreams are becoming a reality because I know that providing our Scholars an opportunity that most students in this country unfortunately aren't receiving which is why as a country we have to shift for computer science for all for real the idea of computer science and you won't you guys may agree with this or not but this is what I talk to folks who don't know computer science this is they say it is so daunting but in 2020 as some of the data shared there were only 423 exams that were taken for AP Computer Science in high school students in DC we have 120 students per grade if 100 of our Scholars take the AP Computer Science exam before they leave High School which is our goal we would increase those numbers by 25 percent this goal and this reality is very close we can do it but part of what makes this goal seem so daunting is what people think about computer science instruction they imagine an intensive boot camp coding classes and it feels very Out Of Reach I'm here to tell you that in the Middle School level computer science is very accessible we don't have dedicated computer science teachers at DPA our Math teachers teach math and computer science and they incorporate projectbased learning into the concepts of the curriculum the teachers love it and so do our Scholars we start early because it's helpful to think of computer science as a foreign language the malleability of our Scholars young brains means that earlier you introduce the material the stickier it becomes you don't expect students to become fluent in Spanish with just four years of high school Spanish but if you immerse them in it they will when they are young they that's another story entirely and here's a brutal facts in high school it is different we cannot expect our algebra and geometry teachers to teach computer science you need a certified computer science teacher at least someone with industry experience who knows the content and to get real with this group the biggest challenge we face in DPA and not not at DPA but across the country is expanding the number of computer science teachers and as we all know we have a K12 teacher shortage alone this shortage is even more acute for computer science teachers and at DPA we put out all the stops to recruit the best and brightest to teach computer science I'm at a policy expert but I know this I'll leave the details to you in this audience to figure out how do we get more teachers to teach computer science but you did give me the mic so I'm going to take this opportunity to share a cup couple ideas that I have first we must embark on a national initiative where tech companies lend us their employees in public schools for a year or two if you give me a Google engineer for two years who gets to keep his nice Google salary and I get to turn I I then get to have them teach with our teachers share their knowledge to improve our teacher capacity that would help us second we do need to dedicate more resources to Computer Science Education the federal government state departments and cities need to provide grants to help build the entire Talent pipeline from high school teachers to Tech Teacher prep providers at the school level we have to experiment with signing bonus higher pay and other Financial ways to lower computer science teachers into public schools I think teaching is the world's most fulfilling and meaningful profession but if we are going to compete with tech companies for a small pool of talent we are going to lose and with that here's my last Point hold on before I leave you I want to bring you back to what really matters and that is our students do you have my uh picture perfect and I want to remind you why I believe so strongly in computer science as the ticket to the 21st century indulge me for a minute these are our founders this is our last day of our end of our first year these Scholars are the future of technology they are the future of innovation and right now they are with us today but back at home there's a scholar that you know there's a school that you know there's a community I need you to put them on your shoulder today as you go through this conference because they need you to be bold they need you to dream big and they need you to break all the rules one last question how many of you raise your hand know of Jeff Bezos anybody know of Jeff Bezos oh okay okay I heard that how many of you guys though keep your head raised I can't really see you but I I can hear you uh how many of you guys know Elon Musk anybody okay hands are raised all right all right here we go how many of you have heard of David Stewart anybody no that's exactly what I thought David Stewart is the CEO of worldwide technology and he is the second richest black man in America he was born in poverty in the segregated South and now he is worth six billion I said billion dollars he should be a household name and yet as I just proved he had he wasn't I want students like Quran to become a world last coder I want students like Jasmine to develop advances in space travel I want students like Samaya Ballard to be Forbes 30 under 30. and at digital Pioneers Academy you will find classrooms where teachers are are not they're not speaking at the podium like me I'm thanks for indulging me but in our classrooms you will see teachers serving as coaches and guides and students doing authentic work so on that note I want you all to commit to keeping those Scholars on your shoulder as you network as we have happy hour as we figure out how to make CS for all for real and I want to and challenge you to do two things computer science should be a graduation requirement for all kids snap if you agree and here's my last challenge I bought my Scholars and our parents here we have to have parents as partners in this effort to bring CS for all for real it is a great start I mean I actually can't believe all these State Chiefs are here today you guys literally run the whole country uh it is the idea that you all are here on this topic of Cs you all have such a tremendous opportunity and I challenge you to keep the scholars at your on your shoulder but to network to know that you're not by yourself we can do this see all CS for all for real thank you foreign thank you for that glimpse into uh a beautiful future that's actually now we hope that there are more schools like digital Pioneers Academy there are more kids like Jasmine and Quran uh more parents like their parents who chose to send their schools to digital Pioneers Academy and obviously more folks like you we have some time for a couple questions we have some mic Runners so if you have a question about like what it looks like for all students to learn computer science year after year after year please ask a question um and unfortunately the lights are right in my eyes uh but uh if our micrunners could put their hands up and yeah and if you have a question you can put your hand up when you when you have when you have a question please just quickly introduce yourself and then ask your question hi Becky ash from Tennessee and what a wonderful idea and culture you've created I wonder if you could um mind read for just a moment with your teachers for us how do you think they would describe their biggest challenge at working at a school like that and what are some of the things that you've done to help them address those great question so let's get let's keep it real running schools and being a teacher is hard work it is hard work prepandemic and it is even tougher post pandemic I actually serve as the principal now and I um I ask this question to our teachers all all the time I would I would actually say the biggest challenge um is is ongoing professional development specifically related to CS but our model and this is where I want to dispel some of the myths because at middle school it is way more accessible High School very different our teachers collaborate but what we tell them at the middle school level is its Project based as long as you do the project before the kids you can fail forward with them so it's a learning experience that you don't have to be the expert at and that mentality and mindset are our teachers really really um address and and I think it makes it easier the second thing that makes it easier is they are collaborating um what I have found is that CS teachers doing it by themselves is what makes it really really hard at our Middle School level they collaborate across the grade so it's like wait how did you figure this out I remember our first year a teacher I mean she was running around the building she's like how do I unlock this code and she was so frustrated she went to teachers she actually went to the kids and they figured it out so I think it's the mindset of collaboration not doing it by yourself but teaching is really really hard I think the obstacle for maybe for maybe for others is actually making sure that there is time and space to play these are all like regular teacher challenges time and space to plan and to to collaborate um I think that would that if I if I could uh you know shut the school down for a week and say you have time to collaborate plan and talk to other people that would give our teachers a huge boost of confidence and time and really get them to be excited to teach and tackle the curriculum but you know teaching is hard kids bring all I mean I know this parents send their very best kids to us they they really do and some days it's a lot tougher so I personally don't think teaching computer science is not the challenge just general teaching is a challenge thank you Michelle uh we have time for one more question out there is there another question out there I can't see I just I just see two Bright Lights okay uh right over here okay one more question uh my name is Ben I come from uh Sioux Falls South Dakota and so Upper Midwest right um I'm an informal science educator and so like I go out to the classroom and talk to kids about science but like how do you how do you keep your teachers engaged with that sort of community you said that like a Google engineer should loan you their or Google send an engineer for a couple of years at a time right but how do you keep your teachers engaged with the people that are coding other than watching videos that they might produce for online content so if I hear this right you're saying that they have access but they may not actually feel like authentically engaged and passionate and committed is that right yeah you know I think for us at our school we always always communicate the why um if the why for us is about being Unapologetic college prep and computer science and for us computer science is about we want our Scholars to have the technical skills we want them to create apps in games and websites and do all the things that coders do and we want them to have the computational thinking skills around problem solving communication and collaboration and so I think when you explain for us doing the curriculum doing our work isn't just about okay teach computer science because it's a requirement it's because we want our Scholars to be on the path to College and Career and these are the skills that are really going to break the cycle of poverty they're going to allow our Scholars to be their very best whatever it is and again one more thing I interviewed a hundred high school kids before I opened the school and what they said to me is yeah yeah we hear you on those high paying high demand jobs we want those too but we want to do what we want to do we want to be a doctor a lawyer a veterinarian and so I think for us as Educators we have to explain the why we have to make the connection that these are skills that you are going to need regardless of any passion any career you have and I think for our Educators when you're we are throwing so much at them I mean and I'm I'm guilty of it as well it's like you got to do attendance you got to call the parents you got to do a sunshine heat calls you got to teach computer science I think for us we always want to be grounded in our why we want to listen to to show empathy to be able to support them but at the end of the day it's about being Unapologetic in your why being Unapologetic about what it means for kids and it's not just computer science because it's a high school requirement although it should be it is because we want our kids to have access to College and Career and opportunities let's give a round floss the mache okay thank you that was awesome
