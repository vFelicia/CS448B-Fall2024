look at this problem it looks very familiar in fact you might feel like you can just go through and move forward and collect nectar wherever there's a flower and not collect it if there's not one the problem is for this pattern the code you would end up with would be way too long so we need to figure out a quicker way to go through and check every square and if there is a flower get nectar but just move along if there's no flower how have we done that before
