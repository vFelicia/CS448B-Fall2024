let's say we're deciding whether we should have a picnic outside with friends or stay home and read a book we can have a picnic if it's sunny outside otherwise we'll stay home and read a book there's a special type of control structure to distinguish between these two different options it's called an ifelse statement an ifelse statement specifies a block of code to execute when a condition is true and a different block of code to execute when a condition is false if it is sunny we have our picnic else we stay home and read a book let's write an fl statement to help us decide what to do first we write the keyword if and an open set of parentheses this is just like the if statements we've written before to check if it's sunny let's call an is sunny method as our condition if it's sunny outside the condition returns true in the body of our statement we can write the code we want to execute if the condition is true let's add an else statement to determine what code to execute in case the condition is false in the body of the else let's put stay home if it's not sunny outside let's stay home and get comfy reading there is another way we can write this we can check if it's not sunny by using a logical operator a logical operator is an operator that returns a boolean value the not operator is a logical operator that returns true when the operand is false and returns false when the operand is true we will write using the not operator by using the exclamation point in front of the condition if it is not sunny outside we'll stay home else we'll have a picnic so if is sunny returns true the not operator makes the condition false if is sunny returns false the not operator makes the condition true we can check if a condition is true first or we can check if a condition is not true first both ways of writing this are correct solutions they do the exact same thing if else statements give us options we can choose to do a task if a condition is true and another task to do if the condition is false this provides more flexibility in our programs you
