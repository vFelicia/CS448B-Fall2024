i'm emily my name is craig my name is ninja i'm eddie my name is andres my name is pan it's actually really cool to just sit down and see the amount of stuff that you can do with code the amount of problems you can solve every day a beautiful thing about computer science is that it's flexible and there's always multiple ways to solve the same problem it's just thinking about what is the simplest and most efficient way of doing things they're part of your goal isn't even necessarily having the best ideas it's about knowing when the best idea has come to the surface kind of an art form you know like it is it is art like code is art and everybody has a different style there's a lot of intersections between liberal arts and technology that makes it a lot of fun having just an idea just something from scratch and then going through the process of building that into reality working through the logic and then making it a product that someone else could use you can build all the worlds you can imagine in vr which is the reason i work in it software engineering is a tool to make users feel or experience or just have an easier life in some way sitting at my office desk i can actually turn off the microwave at my home i get to be the software engineer that makes technology more useful for other people too and super exciting because we're creating so much and evolving every day computer science absolutely is collaborative by its very nature it has to be everybody has a different experience to bring to the table and diversity plays an important role in that you're able to have new experiences with people from a number of different backgrounds so it's definitely key for you to collaborate with others and it actually makes work a lot of fun when you do that nine times out of ten we're going to get the job done better as a team if you're doing it alone you might be doing it wrong there's always more to learn i will ask questions i uh i am not ashamed to say that i do not know you don't have to get it perfect the first time and don't be intimidated by getting started that's the really exciting part about technology is that it's always changing so you're always learning you're always having to stay on top of it but it's exciting so for me the passion comes from the ability that i'm empowering people the things i do now there's no way i would have ever dreamed of this as a kid i never imagined myself in this place and i'm very thankful for it every day i am never bored at my job like there's just an infinite amount of technology out there there's an infinite number of ways to solve problems anybody can do computer science i'm a software engineer i'm a software engineer i'm a software development engineer i am a software engineer i'm a senior software engineer i am a software engineer and you are a software engineer too you
