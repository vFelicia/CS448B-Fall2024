hi I'm Arie Duncan US Secretary of Education and I'm happy to officially kick off the 2013 Computer Science Education week we observe CS Ed week each year in recognition of the birthday of computing Pioneer Admiral Grace Murray Hopper and this year I would especially like to encourage all parents teachers and students to participate in the hour of code the hour of code is meant to encourage kids to try coding to let them see that it can be fun and creative and empowering most parents uh like me unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to learn computer skills growing up in school but today most kids will need those skills along with other skills in science technology and math when they enter a Workforce where they will compete with the best educated young people from everywhere in the world our hope is that the hour of cold activities will pique your interest but we will need to follow follow up on that interest with opportunities to take computer science courses in our nation's schools our children will need computer science so that they can learn how to use that knowledge in problem solving they will need to be able to code and they will need some understanding of algorithms software engineering Big Data cyber security and the limits of what computers can do the study of computer science is not just for those wishing to become it professionals it's actually for everyone it builds critical thinking and problem solving skills and it opens the door to so many forms of creative expression it sets kids up for Success across a wide range of fields including science engineering mathematics medicine education and the media arts and it empowers them to take an active part in the technological Transformations that are literally changing their world so as all of you join in the hour of cod look for other opportunities to learn more about computer science robotics engineering and so much more thank you
