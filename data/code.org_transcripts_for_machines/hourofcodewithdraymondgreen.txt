If you're a high school student that has thought about taking computer science, go after it! I didn't always think I was great at basketball but I approaced it in a way that no matter how good I was then i was going to be great at it. Hard work beats talent, when talent fails to work hard. Alright now I hit run. Draymond Green came to our school. We coded with him. That's my favorite player on the team. I'm so happy. As basketball has taken me so many places, computers can take you so many places. I think it's important to give our kids the necessary tools that they'll need a life to be successful and to continue to push this world forward. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
