So what grade are you in? Second. Tenth grade. First grade. I was in eighth grade when I learned to program. I got my first computer when I was in sixth grade. What gets me excited is being able to fix people's problems. You can express yourself. You can build things from an idea. Computer science is the basis for a lot of the things that college students and professionals will do for the next 20 or 30 years. I like programming because I like helping people. I get the opportunity to build something that makes people's lives easier. I think it's the closest thing we have to a super power. Getting started is the most important part. I'm a beginner myself, and I want you to learn with me.
