Congratulations! You just learned the basic building blocks of computer science. Now you can use these blocks to build your own creation. There are no more instructions and no puzzles to solve. You can build anything you want. You get to choose. [students talking] It's about to get real. Shear. I made an L out of torches. I made an A out of birch planks. It worked, it worked. We built a house out of wool! When you're done making your creation, choose share to get a link to share with your friends. Have fun!
