so my hope is that when i come back out here uh not next year but maybe two years from now that that um i that we've done some things to make this movement more viral and make it easier for teachers because i think you guys were the ones that gave me the stats about how few kids in my state even take the computer science ap course i was shocked that that how few people are even doing that and and so my hope is that we in this room could begin to celebrate those successes
