I believe that computer science is truly for everyone if we are ever going to experience equity and Tech and truly close the digital divide we must have people of all backgrounds shapes sizes colors and experiences obviously alluring was a big influence in computer science but there have been many others there are tons of awesome lgbtqia people in computer science there's a huge Community there are a lot of resources if the usual ways of making Comm Community or reaching out to community does not work for you computer science is a place where you can build and find the way to reach out to people the great thing about computer science is that the content that we're working on is something that is universal and you can find other folks like you who want to solve the same problems you're solving and share other interests as well I believe that computer science is the new means of communication so if you are able to use that tool to get a message across to provide information that can be lifechanging to a community or group of people that's the ultimate power it's really nice when you think about a solution to a problem and then you see this solution shipped and you see real people using the thing that you thought about that's probably the most rewarding thing about my job as we build software systems that increasingly govern more and more of the world we want those systems to be fair and Equitable and representative of you users everyone has a unique way to solve a problem and if we get all those different people together we can solve software problems that you can't solve on your own you know if everyone was the same that would just be a very uninteresting product I think and I think that's why there's so much Innovation happening in Tech right now is it's just growing and there's different types of people who are coming in and helping make things the way that they are when a group of diverse people are working on solving a problem they come up with better Solutions computer science is for everyone if you have a question computer science is for you you have a problem that you think a lot of other people have that you want to solve computer science is for you anybody can do this and we want everybody to be doing this we need storytellers we need artists we need musicians we need you we need your voice and we need you to have a seat at our table
