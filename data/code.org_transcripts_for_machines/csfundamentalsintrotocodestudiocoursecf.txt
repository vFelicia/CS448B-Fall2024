Today we're going to learn to program using a draganddrop language called Blockly. Blockly uses colorful instructions called blocks to build programs, that you can use to solve puzzles. Under the hood, you're still creating code. Each puzzle you'll solve with the code is split into four main parts. On the left is the play area, where your program will run. In the center, you'll see the toolbox area that holds all the blocks that you will need for each puzzle. To the right is your workspace, where you will drag blocks to build your program. Finally, above the workspace, you will see the specific instructions for each puzzle. Don't worry if you accidentally drag out a block that you don't need. If you have an extra block, simply drag it back into the toolbox to put it away. After you hit run you can always hit the reset button to get your character back to the start so you can try again!
