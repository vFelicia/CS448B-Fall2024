Creativity is the ability to create something new in the fabric of humanity. Creativity is bringing your true self, that part of you that maybe scares you a little bit, out into the world. Creativity is combining what you know and what you love, your incredibly unique and unparalleled vision to create something new for the world around you and make something out of nothing. Creativity is being essentially human. Finding new solutions to new problems. Creativity is the language that everyone can speak, and everyone can understand. Creativity is to discover an unexplored way of solving the problem. Creativity is opportunity. What will you create? Subtitles by the Amara.org community
