during make lessons students get the opportunity to write code based on concepts from the explore investigate and practice lessons they're given an app with a completed user interface but usually have little to no starter code they'll need to use all of the skills they've developed in the previous lessons to write the code that will bring the app to life to prepare or make lessons try to create the app yourself and anticipate different approaches different students might take also review the activity guide provided for the make lesson it's a handy tool for helping all of your students or for helping anyone needing additional detailed directions for the make lessons specifically your role is to facilitate a classroom culture around collaboration by encouraging students to utilize one another as thought partners when they're creating their apps in class all right it's looking like most you have your activity guides filled out so we are about to start programming but i want to encourage some collaboration here especially if you're getting stuck the people sitting to your left and right are your best resource and it is totally okay to think out loud or try to help each other think through the challenges you're having all right let's start programming occasionally you may make the decision to bring the whole class together to talk through key misconceptions as a group or even think out loud about how to approach programming this app students who finish early have the opportunity to add functionality to their app beyond what was initially presented or help their teammates in class ask why don't i get you to help some of the people here at this table and you to help some of the people at that table don't write the code for them but help them think through some of the challenges you all ran into okay you knew that yeah awesome thank you it is likely that how you run the make lessons will vary throughout the year you may consider providing more whole room support earlier in the year and then as the year progresses students will feel more comfortable and you can move towards more independent completion of the make tasks oh yeah yeah that's looking really good nice job all right here's what i want you to do on the back there are some extension ideas so you can work on those and if you get through those i'm sure you have even more ideas for how to make this app even cooler let's work on that cool great make tests are designed to take roughly one class period if some students are still uncomfortable with a concept they'll be seeing it again in later eipm sequences oh right these lessons focus on developing students ability to take on the blank screen and design a program from scratch they'll have a chance to summatively and creatively demonstrate knowledge in the end of unit project you
