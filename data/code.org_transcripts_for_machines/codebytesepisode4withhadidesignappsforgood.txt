hi there and welcome to code bites hi i'm here with my son darius darius how old are you 13 he's 13 years old and we're excited to celebrate the fourth day of computer science education week you know all of this week throughout the country and all around the world tens of millions of students are participating in the hour of code to get an introduction to computer science and to celebrate this technology that is changing the society all around us and we have a very special birthday to celebrate today and that we're actually going to ask a poll to help you find out whose birthday it is it's the birthday of the person who wrote the first computer program so can we put up the poll on the screen who wrote the first computer program we have four choices ada lovelace born in 1815 albert einstein born in 1879 grace topper born in 1906 and bill gates born in 1955. and look at that folks are answering the poll right now looks like the winner is bill gates no no grace hopper in 1906. all right almost everybody has voted so let's share the results of the poll yes so you can see uh most people think it's grace hopper who was born in 1906 and then there's kind of a tie between ada loveless and bill gates darius do you know the answer for this it's right let's see so i'm gonna share my screen and yes it's ada loveless and what's pretty incredible about this is ada loveless who was born in the early 1800s she wrote the first computer program 100 years before the first modern computer was invented and this is interesting it goes to show that computer programming isn't just about technology and electronics it's something you can do it's really more sort of about problem solving and algorithmic thinking computational thinking it's also why so many computer scientists learn computer science without a computer i i initially learned in a classroom with a whiteboard without any devices and if you want to see the computer that ada loveless used she didn't actually use this it was a theoretical idea of a wooden machine called the babbage machine and she wrote a computer program for how to control that little device it's kind of cool so one thing i want to do before we get started with today's lesson is to find out where everybody's from uh if folks could go into the chat area and type where your calling in from and unfortunately those of you who are on zoom uh won't have that but there's can you read off some of the locations as you see them michigan india toronto canada billy's florida uav arab emirates united arab emirates that's amazing that means it's 8 p.m over there sri lanka wow richmond hill wow that is all over the world uh all right well let's close the chat for now there's a lot of stuff there that's right so today what we're gonna talk about uh actually since there's some spam can you reopen the chat and can everybody just type your first name in just to make that spam scroll away all right thank you now we can close the chat all right um we're not going to use the chat anymore today because some some students are basically posting is probably not students it's spammers we're just posting random youtube urls that we don't want to distract people with so today we're going to talk about the theme of this week's computer science education week is computer science for good so what we're going to do is create some apps uh apps that are basically designed to basically help make the world a better place because one of the more important things with technology is figuring out not just what you can do with a computer but what you should do with a computer how to use technology to help our world so the first app we want to make is going to be based on volunteering in our region darius and i live in the area of seattle washington and bellevue just in the seattle metro area so i'm going to demo the app that i started working on and then darius is going to help finish it so in just one second we're going to go into app lab so here we are in app lab if you can see my screen and the app that we're building here you can see the app on the left and the code is going to be on the right and i'm going to run this app and it's not complete yet it shows some of the ways you can help in your local community and this area is empty but if you want one of these areas is to help with a food bank and to volunteer and you click here and it shows you options for different food banks and says you can donate or volunteer at a food bank to help those who are in need in the pandemic but of course wear a mask and we can go back here and i want to add another volunteering option with darius you ready for this okay right so um first i want first you can see up here we can do code mode or design mode we're gonna go into design mode to add some features to our app so first can you make a button like that you can drag a button out like that yeah and then make it larger button wait you can just drag it from the corner if you want that's cool oops oh there and then if you want to make it look kind of cool with that border you can change its border size if you scroll down here and make the border width like 10 or something but look how it's yours is more square and that's more curly so you can change the border radius a little bit too you can make i like card is a border color well what if i mean change the border radius to like i don't know you can hit the little arrow buttons to move those up and down it makes it more of a curvy button perfect and you want to make the border a little bit larger too so it's similar to the other border the other button yeah yeah cool and now pick an image to put in this and i want to make our volunteering place to be about cats and dogs so choose this image all right so we're going to do an animal shelter kind of volunteering thing and the other thing i wanted to do is to get rid of this text for this button here so this isn't super pretty one of the things we can do in app lab is change themes for our app so click on the theme area here yeah look at all those different themes but let's use a poll to ask what theme we should use can we display the poll up on the screen so you can choose the orange or glow in the dark or coral reef or blue steel no no don't don't choose them yet it's showing are you showing the options that's orange well it looks like everyone's doing glow in the dark anyway that's glow in the dark choose coral reef all right let's close the poll because and share the results it looks like almost everybody wanted glow in the dark so click stop sharing there all right so we're now in the glow in the dark theme with our buttons here so now what we want to do is if you look over here we have the home screen and the food screen the food screen is the one that i showed you here we want to make a screen that looks like this but that is for uh working at a you know supporting an animal shelter so there's multiple different ways we can make a screen like this we can either make a new screen or we can duplicate this existing screen the easy way would be to duplicate but i want to make it a little bit more work for you to show how design mode works so can you click to choose new screen now we're going to make a new screen do you want to pick a theme for this screen to make it slightly different than all the other ones i think our second choice that from the audience was orange so you could go with that if you want orange i think i thought it was blue steel okay choose blue steel that sounds good to me really matter i don't know why these aren't all right oh they're loose right so for this drag out two buttons or make one button you can then duplicate it and look how the button in blue steel has got extra round corners but make it bigger and kind of square bigger bigger bigger or bigger okay and if you want to make it totally circle shaped you can make the button radius even larger so that's a perfect square okay so scroll down see where it says border radius make that bigger and bigger until it becomes round just hold click your mouse and hold on it and see it makes all right now you have an allaround button and you can make the border with like 10 to make it a thick border there you go and now choose an image for this button and let's choose the cap all right and then delete the text for button to cue cat all right and now we can duplicate this button to make another button and have this one have the dog all right and these are sort of our choices for the animal shelter and then lastly i'm going to make another button that is for going home and we'll put this up here and for this button we can look we if you want to choose the image for this you can also choose icons so can you type home home oh that icon is barely visible because it's covered by the text right there's our home button so now i want to show what happens how do we jump from the home screen to come to this screen we need to write some code and the question is what code should we use so which block should we use to change the screen when the button is clicked we can use an on event block a show element block a set check block or a set screen block let's do a poll to see what the our students think how do we change the screen to find out when the button is clicked we change the screen right most people are saying it's set screen but a lot of people are saying on event some people are saying show elements some people are saying set checked but the most popular one they say is set screen so this was actually a trick question because we need two blocks we need an on event block to find out when you click and then a set screen block to change the screens and let's show you how that works so we're going to go figure out the code here to say that when this button is clicked and it's called button 4 so darius can you pull out an on event block put it to the top the very top okay yeah and then choose when button four is clicked when button four is clicked and now go into set screen set screen and choose what are the choices there i think it's screen one that's the new screen that we created so now hit the run button and you can click that yeah and now that takes us to the animal shelter screen but if you click these none of these work so we need to make some changes to make those buttons work as well so go back and hit reset and go back now you want to look at the screen so click here to go look at the options there okay screen one with and if you hover over these buttons that's button five and that's button six so add the on events so for when button five is clicked and add another on event for when button six is clicked and we need to do write the code for what happens when these buttons are clicked and for these we use a piece of code to jump to a url using the open command see open url i didn't know about that one yeah right now it says they should go to code.org but if you look over here i've pre loaded these tabs so this is the meow cat rescue site so we're going to copy the link for that and put it here and over here we have the seattle humane society and i'm going to copy the link for that i'll put it here and then can you lastly for button seven make it so that goes back to the home screen on event button seven and then set screen so this is basically and have that go to the home screen so our app should be done now so click run to see how it works and now you can click and it says you're leaving this website you can click continue and it opens a new tab that takes you to meow cat rescue and you can click the home button to go back and look at food banks and so on so we finished our first basic app for volunteering and what's great is once you've made this app you can share it with anybody and in fact you can use this app on your phone so if you pull out your phone and scan this little qr code over here just open the phone's camera and scan that code and if anybody's following on you can also use your phone cameras to do the same thing and now you have the app on your phone doing basically exactly what we programmed so i want to show us a different type of app that's more kind of a feelgood app uh and you know since we're talking about the theme of computer science for good this app we're gonna show is going to show basically how to help support you with mental health and i've already got the finished version of this app what this app does is it's going to be sort of a pep talk app have you ever seen on youtube where people give pep talks to make you feel better have you taken those pep talks yourself no no all right well maybe you could they're kind of fun but this app will give me a pep talk by letting me take a picture of myself so i'm gonna take a photo of myself are you going to photo of you yay there's a photo of darius and then it puts his photo up on the screen with a little line that says believe in yourself you can't see it because of the camera it says believe in yourself it gave you a cool little pep talk you take a selfie and it gives you some encouraging words it's a very simple app but let's see how we built this so i'm going to share the screen again so right now what this app has it has this starter screen and what we want to do is add the ability to take a photo and put an encouraging message so let's go into design mode there's a new button you've never ever seen can you figure out how to add a button that takes a photo photo select photo select that's an all new button we've added to apple i put it at the bottom of the screen so what happens this is like a selector like a check box or a radio button but instead it's a photo selector so go to the code mode so i'll show you how we can use the code for this so you can say on event and then choose when photo select and it's photo select two and choose the change change so that basically finds out when the photo select button has changed which means somebody took a new photo with it and then you can actually get the image url for that and put that into this image see this image over here we want to change the image url for this um but to what we want to change it to is the photo that you picked from here so let's create a variable go under variables and say variable x equals i'll put it inside the on event and we're going to get the image url so look for get image url and we're going to get the get the image from the photo select so x now has that image and we want to put it into this guy so say set image url oh whoops set image url and now choose let's but we shouldn't give it the code logo we should give it the value of x and oops wait and you wouldn't need the you don't want the quotes so that puts the image on the screen and we can demo it although it's kind of funky because we aren't using a camera so when we click this right now to select an image it'll just ask us to choose a photo from our file system so i'm going to choose the cat image and look it put the cat on screen but it doesn't have any words of encouragement it just says you got this so now how do we pick the words of encouragement see this thing up here it's got this sort of texts like you are amazing today is your day believe in yourself i'm going to show what this is this is a list so basically the name of the list is encouragement and it has all these options you are amazing today is your day believe in yourself and one thing you should note is that lists in computer science start with location zero so this is the z you know when you count usually you go one two three four but for computers you start counting at zero the first number is zero this is one this is two so uh now the next thing i want to do is let's add some items to our list actually before we do that i want to test if people figure out how this works if i print out the encouragement at location one what will be printed can we do a quick poll to ask the audience this should be relatively easy but if we do a quick poll of what gets printed at location one you can choose you are amazing today is your day believe in yourself or all of the above all right i'm going to give you a little help remember that the locations start with zero all right well if we share the poll results add the answer is the second item location one is this one location zero as you are amazing location one is today is your day and location two is believe in yourself so now let's write some code that basically randomly picks one of these awesome options but i actually want to add to these because only three is enough so isn't enough so let's add some more examples not just three so can you say some happy things that you might want as pep talk and i'll type them in so pick something encouraging you could say um great job great job all right you are awesome you are awesome do one more you're the best okay all right yeah so now how many how many do we have total of these one two three four five six we have six awesome things to say and so what we want to do is put them in this little label which is id text output so to do that you want to go use the set text command actually i think it's higher up oh yes set text and choose the text output now instead of putting in the text that goes in there we want to choose one of those six items so we want to choose from that list the name of that list is encouragement so we want an item from that list so i'm going to type in encouragement and put these brackets and then we can put any number we want so we can put 0 we can one two it'll pick a number from that list but if we do this what are the what are the choices for what numbers we put in there zero one two three four and five because there's no six there is no six there's five options so to do this we wanna pick a random number from zero to five so can you figure out how to do that if you go into the math function and i'm to change this into text mode and so we want to put a random thing here so can you figure out how to do that you go into math you said and choose random number random number we don't want between 1 and ten that's way too much you want from zero to six yep i got rid zero of five what's the other six no zero to five because there's six options i was trying to trick you okay all right i think we're good now so this should work i'm gonna run it one more time and again this isn't using my phone camera because i'm on a computer but i'll put the dog this time did i get it maybe it's slow because the dog is a big photo i'll try it again with the cat yes just well it should work let's use our can you i'm going to share it and you can scan it into your phone and choose that and now you have this app on your phone as well now you can take a photo you got a photo of me all right kind of use that photo and great and what does it say on it says you're the best i am the best thank you so much kind of hard to see all right well that was our second app of the day so we just showed two different apps one for volunteering and one for giving yourself encouragement to help support your mental health so this is our fourth day of the hour of code thank you for those of you who tuned in late if you missed this today we're going to have a repeat of today's episode later on today and otherwise we'll see you tomorrow morning at the same time same place and tomorrow we're going to do something awesome using minecraft and coding and using minecraft so thank you all for joining us for the hour of code this week and for today's code bites we'll see you later byebye bye so
