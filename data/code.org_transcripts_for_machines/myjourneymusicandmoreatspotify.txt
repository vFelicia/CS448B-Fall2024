hello everyone my name is meg i am an engineer at code.org and i will be moderating today's chat thanks to all the classrooms for coming out to our first my journeys clash chats of the spring teachers we have enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats going forward today we are fortunate to have not one but two guests puja and himanshu joining us from spotify to tell us about their journey to where they are now what they do at spotify and how they use computer science in their jobs they'll also share helpful advice for students who might be thinking about a career in computer science teachers please please please put questions in the chat that come up and we will try our best to get to some of those at the end of the talk so we're going to start with some introductions and an icebreaker the ice breaker for today is because you all work at spotify who or what is on your favorite spotify playlist right now so i'll go first my name is meg i will be moderating i personally have been listening to lots of broadway lots of disney recently moana's how far i go has been on repeat if you know that song so puja and himanchu please share a little bit about your role at spotify and give us your answer to the icebreaker puja could you start us off thank you so much meg first of all hi everybody my name is puja dave and i'm so so excited and happy to be here with all of you today i work at spotify i'm a senior engineering manager in the spotify advertising space so myself and my team we run what the ads that you see on the spotify app so if you are using a spotify and listening to music on the free uh version uh you will get ads while you're listening whether that's an ad you see or whether that's an ad you hear that's what my team works on we work on the engineering side where we write a lot of code to make that happen uh in terms of when you're listening what would be an ad that would be relevant to you when should we show that ad what should that ad be how should that ad look like um uh or sound like is uh what my team is responsible for it's a very exciting space to be in um i've been at spotify for five years prior to that i was working at microsoft for seven years and about 12 years ago i graduated from carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh and i did my master's in electrical and computer engineering uh icebreaker question love that question uh my spotify app actually has been hijacked by my two kids right now and what's on the playlist is baby shark for my little one uh she loves it she keeps listening to it over and over again whether or not i like it i also listen to it so that's what on my spotify app and playlist right now uh with that over to you himanshu thanks puja um so i just looked up my spotify's uh light songs and the top one is a song called doves from a band called we are all astronauts i love spotify for its discover weekly thing so every week there's new songs which i love to my heart but i have never heard of it so grateful to work um you know work here and you know contribute to the part of the journey so hey everyone my name is himanshu i'm tuning in from stockholm sweden it's about evening time right now i came here to work for spotify about one and a half years ago i'm a software engineer here but recently transitioning into this new role called developer advocate and which i can talk about later but i had not heard of this role when i was in college um so grateful to the all the people who help you know people like me trying to explore new things and hoping i can do the same today um i graduated from india about three years ago and i studied mathematics and computer science uh over there and at spotify i've been so you can imagine spotify is a huge app you can play it on your tv on your playstation phone laptop you know so many devices there's got to be like thousands of engineers putting in code to make that happen so i work on a software which helps those engineers do their daily job um and that's it over to you meg thank you all so much for being here and for sharing himanshu i want to throw it back to you could you maybe share a cool project that you've worked on with code sure uh let me share my screen um so i'm not sure if you all can you see the right screen uh you should have yeah you got it awesome thank you so uh when i was in college i got to know about this thing called github and open source um so the whole philosophy was that you can create anything you want and work with other people um so yeah i love open source i've been creating multiple projects when i was in college and most often than not not those projects came out of my own personal interest i'm not sure if you if you if you remember him but this this tv series called friends and i'm obsessed with it and i was obsessed with it as well and there's like 200 over 200 episodes and i've watched them the whole entire season couple of times but i wanted to watch more like random episodes from the from the series and i found that i when i was going into my directory and click finding the right season and clicking a random episode it wasn't so random at all i was always clicking in the middle and always clicking you know somewhere somewhere in the middle of my screen and i was watching the same episodes again and again so this is a tool i created to help me binge watch things so i loaded up all all the tv series that i wanted to watch and uh just i used to open this up and click on something and i wish to get like a new episode just like in the in the gif um so yeah and i also wanted to explore a new technology that's one of the reasons why i like open source and doing multiple projects is that you have to build something new why don't you build it in a new programming language and new framework for example so i wanted to learn javascript back then and this is what i created um and i put it up on reddit there's this website um not sure if if um there's an age limitation but i put it up on the programming subreddit and i said hey i'm new to javascript give me feedback and i got people commenting on my code helping me like you know refactor stuff and you know adjust things and make it better and all so overall this is the project i wanted to share um i think yeah if you're if you're in college and want to learn new things i think doing projects is a great way to do that what do you meg thanks for sharing him on you puja i want to throw it back to you and ask can you walk us through how you got from puja in school to puja at spotify so what courses you took what learning you had both in school and after school yeah i would love to share my journey um i do have some visuals so i will also take the liberty of uh sharing my screen um give me one second here and can you guys see megan yes we got it thanks that is me this is when i graduated um over a decade ago um from cmu um so my journey has been you know when i was in high school um i was very interested in uh engineering and logic in programming and physics math those were my favorite subjects um so while i was uh trying to see what do i want to do next a team that has been in my entire journey is learning from others interacting from other with others and seeing what they're doing that for me was exploration to see what is out there in the world what are all my options um and what excites me the most what makes me uh very happy within when i'm doing that um so i spoke with a lot of family members with a lot of peers my own friends people who were working in the industry joining sessions like these um to see what is out there what does software engineering even mean in the real world and that's where i learned more and i was clear that after high school i wanted to go into undergraduate and do my engineering so that led me to do electrical engineering i started off being very interested in the hardware behind the scenes what happens when um you're working with the you know the the actual hardware of computer systems what is inside the laptop how do you work with that i i remember tampering with back in the day we used to have walkmans um you know as a as the audio device no no spotify so i would just tinker with that i would open it i would start seeing all the capacitors start soldering it etc so that led me to electrical engineering and then after the first two years of being so involved in the hardware i got exposed to software and the power that programming had to operate those devices um so i started taking courses like objective oriented programming which is around java and c sharp sql databases i started getting my hands dirty into programming uh starting from very simple code whether that's with python and just you know make with astrix make a christmas tree um solving those kind of things got me excited uh and that led me to hey i want to do more of this two years is not enough in the last four years of my engineering so i decided to do masters in computer science and that's when i came to the united states in the master's program i got deeper into all of these programming concepts um and i took courses like you know uh operating systems um wireless networks um packet switching i was very interested back then in in wireless communications etc i spoke with as i said a theme was talking to people so i spoke with my professors my tas my classmates my peers where do they come from what excites them what are they doing what are my options basically that to explore and learn with which is the path forward that led me to my first job which is at microsoft then i became a software developer there um and i got an exposure into how do you do all of that programming in the real world building things that people are using um so that was a very very interesting and fun experience to be exposed to all of that i remember my first day sitting on the computer and be like i don't know what i'm supposed to do here um and there were things uh i still don't know you always learn um so the first few months i had to learn a new programming language c sharp which was similar to java um so i rely a lot on the 70 2010 model uh a leadership model which means 70 of what you learn is uh by doing so you know stuff like assignments or projects is most of the learning happens there twenty percent is what you learn by uh you know talking to other people listening to their experiences uh how do they approach problem solving um etc and then 10 is through books through academics to trainings for courses so you know books like headfirst java uh for java and i had to learn c plus plus so essential c plus plus i took that book up design patterns i took a lot of courses to just teach myself on the job and after spending seven years at microsoft i am now at spotify um this is actually in the stockholm office himanshu where you are i'm i'm working from new jersey uh and i at spotify i've been here for five years still still very much learning all the time learning and doing software engineering so now my job is as i said earlier is these are the ads that i was talking about so when you're listening to spotify the ads that you see or hear what is the engineering and the programming that goes behind it so that's what me and my team um develop um so how do you see these ads what does the um experience look like um you know whether it should be a visual ad when should it play when you're listening to the song should it be at the 10th second should it be at the 20th second what happens when you click on the ad does it go and navigate to some place else and there's a lot that goes on uh from a software engineering point of view um and yeah that's been my journey i'll cover this later actually but uh the two things i would say a takeaway that has always helped me in that journey is uh trying to seek that clarity uh it is okay if you do not know what you want to do but attempting to explore and see what are my options out there and what excites me the most is my calling uh in the 12 years i did not know i would be here today um i did not know i would be in software engineering but it was a journey of trials and errors and seeing what works for me and learning uh during that journey and the second thing i would say is believe in yourself uh it's okay to make mistakes it's okay to not know what you're doing um but that's the fun that's the challenge uh each one of you bring a very unique quality um to everything that you work on and that's what in the real world matters everything that we're making at the end of the day is being used by people like us uh by people like you you are listening to spotify and that's what we want when we are building those things when we're creating those things we want that diversity to show in what we're building um so whether you're from a different part of the world whether you speak another language uh you come from a different background all of that is uh what makes you and what teams like us and people like us at spotify or any any other company looks for so try to seek that clarity and try to believe believe in yourself you can do it and that's been my journey where i am today and i'm very fortunate and blessed uh to be here thanks so much for sharing y'all we've got some good comments and questions in the chat so keep them coming i do want to shout out maureen garda's class they are in pittsburgh and cmu is in their hometown so it's very exciting we also got a question in the chat this is from uh lorenda hints um himachal i'm gonna ask this to you and then puja if you want to add on you can so you mentioned learning a new coding language do you find that learning a new coding language is easier if you already know another coding language um yes and no yes it's easier if you have worked in that area before so for example when i had learned java in school um and when i had to learn c plus plus on the job they were different but the principles of those two languages were very similar so it did help me understand that a lot faster but uh the know of my answer is sometimes there's so many programming languages that are out there python react node.js javascript and conceptually uh they're not always the same and that's okay so i've also had to teach myself uh python or scripting languages like javascript which are very different from uh object oriented you know objectiveoriented languages like java um but it is you learn you learn in the process uh conceptually software engineer it's all within the same umbrella um so you you learn over time so i would say if you know uh something similar that helps but if you don't know that's fine too sure i think that that's spot on um i would something that i'm finding out recently is that there are families of programming languages so whenever someone is creating a new one um they are already influenced by something existing um so for example this thing called golang something that all the creators shared between them was they all hated c business i'm just saying that there is an influence um coming coming from pre existing languages so for example if you if you like javascript uh you would find that it depends or it takes inspiration a lot from python that just happened but if you want to learn something called erlang you'd like you'll be like what there's no for loop in here um so it's like a functional programming language tree and it's very hard to break into it if you already know like let's say c plus plus java or python because it's a different family of languages so it does help to you know if you know one in that family so i would i would recommend like trying out a very low level language like c for example but then try out something which is very high level like python for example um learning things from different families will help you uh understand like new if something new is thrown at you you can actually make connections and you know try to understand something um in in in this new thing that's being thrown at you that's just something to add thanks both for sharing i want to move to something outside of tech so i'm curious what do you enjoy doing outside of work what's something interesting about yourself himanshu can we start with you sure absolutely um so what do i do outside of work a lot of things i found out that i don't have like one or two hobbies and i'm kind of the person who likes to try out multiple things for example recently i'm doing a lot of gaming and there's this new pc that you can see in the background just arrived two weeks ago and all my weekends are just being sucked on on that computer um i like cooking a lot so i live in stockholm and my parents live in india and they like to know that i'm eating well so i cook indian food and just send pictures to make sure you know they're they're happy when i was in school i got into poetry um i found out that writing is a very writing is a great way to express yourself and sometimes you know it's it's very hard uh so yeah poetry writing short stories i had like unpublished short novels uh in school i no longer write that much but i found out that that really helps me um what else uh i like to play a lot of football soccer for you folks uh in the us um to play fifa and then when it's summer in stockholm also like meet my fellow spotifyers and we play together on a field um yeah i like to do different things i i think um looking at world from different perceptions is super helpful uh i would like to know how an artist thinks of the world and not just and how engineer looks at the world so that's why i'd like to try out things i'm not good at any of those things puja over to you yeah i can screen share again the sneak peek that i gave you the last time um just to give you an insight into can you guys see my screen not yet uh all right you see what's going on here okay this should work now yes we got it perfect so for me um it's traveling um which is changed in the last year or two but before that um i love to travel i love to explore different parts of the world so i've put a few pictures here together um where you know i'm excited there in the swiss alps to see the modern lights in um in finland uh that was a fun experience to do ice fishing as well uh in finland uh so i like doing things that the locals uh like doing i did catch a fish and i was the only one who did that day um the one below there with me and the camera i was into photography a few years ago uh was me in africa we were taking a safari in tanzania and i got some amazing pictures in that trip and to see you know almost lion king being played in real life and then we i have a few pictures here that's my son there enjoying pizza in naples or uh you know in greece all of this to say i just love love love traveling i think that to me um you know gives me that exposure to how things are in different parts of the world um outside of that i love uh you know spending time with my family um i have two uh wonderful kids and um i just enjoy spending time with them and what else i like running um that's that's where i think um i can just break from everything else especially when problem solving and coding it really helps me to put my mind at ease you know when you are stuck in a problem and you don't know how to get past it just taking that break going for a quick run uh when the weather is nice and warm uh and then come back and then you're able to solve it so i'm not a not a runner they're doing marathons but i just enjoy my you know few miles here and there um but that's that's me yay such a wide variety of interest thanks for sharing y'all uh we have so many questions uh i don't know if we can get to all of them but kevin braun's class asks we are watching from an allgirls school in dallas texas puja can you share your experiences being a woman in a maledominated field that's amazing kevin uh thanks for this wonderful question i would love to share my experiences being a woman um um you know i think it goes back to what i mentioned earlier is just being just believing in yourself that has been my motto uh all along doesn't mean it came easy in the beginning um you know there were moments where i wasn't believing in myself i wasn't sure what i'm doing um i would be in you know classes where that ratio was off or be the only person in the room um being in a male dominated field a lot of that has changed now which i'm so happy about um uh but it really comes down to you know is believing in yourself as i said each in software engineering we build products we build code that is used by uh people those people are children those people are women those people are men um so if if we lack that diversity when we're building that code we will not be able to be successful for people who are using that code so when i understood that and realized that that was it that was the point for me where it doesn't matter you know uh i need to i need to bring that unique perspective uh when we are coding uh that only i have that no one else might have whoever else is in the room uh and that holds true to you know any other group it doesn't it's not just true to being a woman in a male dominated field it's where you come from as i said it's the languages you speak um all of that is to me very important it's a sense of belonging um i'm so proud and happy to where the industry has come to today um and i like to give back i'd like to make sure that um you know i am accessible um to those people who feel that way in the beginning um or at any point in their career now how can i help and support um grow that community even more um so to me it has been i will say it's it's all for me it was within that how do i gain that confidence uh to be out there and give give my best and everything else follows i've had a lot of sponsors uh women in senior leadership roles that i've looked up to i've reached out to them i still do um you know i i watch a lot of videos a lot listen to a lot of podcasts of ceos of companies who are women and that inspires me that keeps me motivated um so i think that that has been my experience it's actually been um very positive uh because it's the confidence that helps great thanks y'all we have another shout out from five mile town college and they're in northern ireland and they say it's really useful to get the idea of working in i.t beyond our we country so uh i wanna we only have a few minutes left so i wanna wrap up by asking if you could give one piece of advice to students who are listening it could be work related or not work related what would it be himanshu can we start with you sure um i think uh something that has worked well for me is uh the phrase goes by ask for forgiveness and not permission um it's a core concept in python as well sorry for getting too geeky at times but i have used it a lot of times by when i'm like reaching out to people for help uh so when i was in college in my first year let's say or freshman as you call it um they were seniors like who were graduating or who were joining companies and i wanted to know like how much academia is going to help me and how what should i do in projects and whatnot but they they were seniors and it's very daunting to talk to them at times sorry am i wasting their time are they even interested in you know talking to me so i've tried to you know just um assume that it's okay if they don't want to talk to and you know i'll just move on and ask someone else um so yeah ask for forgiveness and not permission when it comes to you know improving yourself and search so it has worked for me so that's something i would like to say puja what's uh what's your advice i think the two things that i mentioned earlier are according to me um so have try to seek that clarity what you want to do what makes you happy and believe in yourself so the new one that i'll throw in is have fun uh enjoy the process um you know there's there's a lot to do uh in software engineering um uh just make sure that you know every time you learn something new every time your code fails it does not build it's it's fun it's it's that process that you need to enjoy and uh make sure you're happy when you're doing it so just just have fun you know it's uh it's a very very amazing amazing field software engineering and computer science you can have so much impact whether whatever you choose to do work at spotify work it another company work it you know nasa or wherever code is everywhere um it's just enjoy that process great thanks so much uh we do have one question more and i think we have time for it this is from the shorter's class from in greenville south carolina uh the question is about was it hard to adjust to a new country in your field when you had to move and get a new job and it's coming from a female student who is a a asian american i'm guessing yeah i can uh take that on and i know himanshu you also probably have experiences you can share is it hard when you move to a new country uh yes uh it is hard um you know it takes it takes some time to understand the different cultures the different ways in which people think communicate etc i think the biggest challenge for me was in the beginning i was trying to fit in um and that made it harder but the moment i realized i don't need to try to fit in i need to be me and that's what people will appreciate i need to be real uh because it's for the people here in this new country they want to learn from me too and the moment i stopped trying to fit in is when everything changed it became so easy uh on myself and on others and that's when i started building relationships um uh in in those you know the networking with people that became a lot more authentic um that would be my response himanshu over there sure um i've had like multiple experiences of search being in us and now in europe and previously in japan so i've seen like different types of cultures and i'm just i'm amazed by how different they can be like you know east versus west uh kind of thing um so one thing that has helped me is to actually like do my research you know just on the history of the country like why do they behave like this and why is it this thing is important to them and this thing is not um just talking to people from the origin has also helped me you know just get that um perspective so i don't take things for granted you know something is important to me doesn't mean it's also important to other people um so that that mindfulness has helped me a lot language is tricky um so glad that a lot of people in sweden speak english but language gets tricky and if you're moving to a new country definitely try to learn the language i think that it will help you a lot you know just in d today task and you won't feel like a tourist in in the place where you're living and the last thing that i am always mindful of is that this is this might be temporary so i'm not here and stuck here for like years and years and i have control of like where i want to live um so yeah enjoy the ride maybe it's maybe you'll be somewhere else in two years so enjoy this new country take it as a challenge but you know also as an opportunity to know something else um know about new culture and new people all right thank you we do have to wrap it up i do want to say that student was africanamerican not asian american so qualities that student but thank you both so much for joining and for sharing all of your wisdom and advice teachers and classes thank you all so much for joining bye
