in investigate lessons students are on computers reading discussing and modifying examples of working code this is when they transition from the mental model they developed in the explore lesson to actually programming with a new concept the majority of an investigate lesson is focused on reading and modifying two or three example programs all right class today we are going to be doing three things we are going to be reading code we are going to be discussing as a full class what it is we're seeing and then we're going to be modifying code to test out our knowledge so let's get laptops out and start working on this first program to prepare for investigate lessons you'll want to have a good handle on the program students will be reading and the prompts they'll be discussing read the sample programs yourself and review the discussion prompts yeah it could be tricky try to anticipate misconceptions in advance and plan when you'll bring the whole class together for discussions in the following discussions ask students to share what they're noticing with one another before bubbling up any key takeaways to the whole class all right class i'm gonna bring us back together i saw you all are reading the program hearing some good discussions at tables let's talk together about how this program works is there anybody who wants to offer a line of code they think is particular since this is a collaborative lesson make sure to keep the class together with no students ahead or behind at any point finally encourage students to modify the program to test out their knowledge and practice programming with the new concept it works yeah to wrap up an investigate lesson you'll lead a discussion that reviews the concept and highlights common patterns for using it these patterns frequently appear in practice and make lessons
