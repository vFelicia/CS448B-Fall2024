everyone welcome to the final day of Cs edcon which is quite sad I know we've been having a great time together but I'm really excited uh to be your host MC for the last and best plenary of Cs edcon and we're going to be talking about the 2023 state of Cs report so if you already have your hard copy feel free to pull it out and follow along if you don't have it don't worry we have plenty left still at registration so I am excited uh to welcome up my coauthors so before I do that though my name is Hannah Weissman and I am the director of policy code.org and the author of the state of Cs report and I'm going to be joined on stage by two of my great coauthors so BT from the computer science Teachers Association and Josh Childs from esep so I'll be talking a little bit about uh my section of the report and then I'll turn it over to them uh so we will give you guys a great overview and you're again take it out and follow along so our big headline this year is that 2023 is the biggest year of growth since 2018 so well over half of high schools in the country now have access to foundational computer science and when you see where we started in 2018 that is amazing progress and we should all feel incredibly proud of that so many more students have access to computer science than they did just five years ago and while we don't have data from 10 years ago would would be even worse 10 years ago so we've made so much progress um but I know that uh we're all a little competitive as well so we like the national number but we also like to see uh state facts as well so you can see that there really is a big range um in the country there's still states that have a minority of their schools offering computer science all the way to states that have almost every one of their high schools offering computer science um this map is in the book along with a lot of other ways to to see where your state ranks and and see what your neighbors are up to importantly as well just because computer science is offered doesn't necessarily mean that students are taking it so we are so excited this year to see that there are more students than ever before enrolled in computer science and so we have over 700,000 high school students taking computer science importantly we actually don't get data from every state so this number is even higher if we were to get data from all 50 states we also this year for the first time got data from a ton of States about middle school computer science so so many of us in this room right we know that early exposure is crucial we don't want the first computer science opportunity to be when a student is in ninth grade and so we had data from 19 States this year that almost 350,000 students were taking computer science that Middle School level and again if we had data from every state those numbers would be even higher so you can see in the state of Cs report there's a map that shows which states gave us data this year if your state is not included please reach out talk to your policy makers talk to your Department of Education we want to get data from every state it's so crucial for us to have that data to keep everyone accountable to be achieving our goals and really making sure that every student has uh both the ability to participate and then it's actually enrolled it's not just enough that they have a course offer but we we actually want to see all students enrolled in computer science and so with such tremendous growth in progress this year some of us might be asking how how did that happen and it's it's not a coincidence it's thanks to so many of us in this room here and a lot of it is due to policies right this doesn't happen overnight this is sustained Statewide commitment and effort and so these are the 10 policies recommended by the code.org aacy Coalition many of you in this room are a part of that advocacy Coalition and while I'm not going to go through all of these policies what they do is they make sure that there's the capacity to teach computer science they make sure there's developed and strong leaders at the school and administrative level and they make sure that students have access and that there is equity for all students taking computer science I do want to call out that this year the code.org absy Coalition added our 10th policy which is recommending that every state Implement a graduation requirement we have seen that even when students have the opportunity to take computer science they do not all enroll particularly our young women are economically disadvantaged students so graduation requirement means that every student has an opportunity uh an introductory computer science experience and then hopefully they go on to take more and continue exploring computer science so again we love a good map we love some competition so here you can see uh the policy adoption across state and one of the things that's really exciting that we passed a few years ago is that every state now has at least one policy promoting computer science at the Statewide level and that is really crucial to making sure that this doesn't uh disappear in a few years that it is part of the state's education ecosystem and you can see that we have several states that have all of our policies which is really exciting and just like how we're hoping to get every High School offering computer science we want every state on this map to be that dark blue so just to give you some quick um highlights from this past year we have 10 states that have nine or more policies and these states it's not a coincidence these states have really high access and they have high participation because their states have committed and invested uh at the state level uh to policies that ensure that their teachers and students are well prepared to succeed in computer science we also have three states this year that joined our five other states in having a computer science graduation requirements that's North Carolina North Dakota and Rhode Island So within the next five years all these states will be requiring uh to graduate high school to take a computer science course this year we had five states pass firsttime funding and that is so crucial because we see that once you pass funding for the first time it's so much easier to continue funding computer science to continue investing on the state level so we had Illinois Louisiana Michigan my home state of Minnesota uh and New Hampshire this year and that contributed to more money than ever before being allocated to Computer Science Education so we had over 120 million and that's just at the state level that doesn't include any federal grants any money um from private or matches and so more money than ever been before has been flowing in to ensure that our teachers are well equipped and our students are prepared and excited for computer science now every year right we want we want to keep it interesting we don't want to have the same old thing every year so among the many new things in the report this year um is looking at the data uh by school size and so as some of you may be aware we actually have so many small high schools in this country over 50% of the high schools that are in this country are actually under 500 students and what we discovered this year is that it is so much harder for these high schools uh to be teaching computer science and so if we look at this graph here small high schools are student high schools with 500 students or less medium schools are uh between 500 and 1200 students and large schools are 1200 students or more so if we look at the large Schools they're almost all teaching computer science if a student is going to a school with more than 1,200 students they very very likely have access to computer science but that's contrasted with that most of the students at small high schools are not having access to computer science so when we think about that nationally we're at about 57 and a half% to get to that 100% % almost all of our work is going to be in small schools and as I mentioned for some of you who are at my session two days ago this is not just a rural issue there are small schools in urban areas Suburban areas rural areas these are public schools these are uh Charter Schools all of these schools need additional resources and help uh to get computer science offered we know that in these schools teachers often wear many hats um there might be less resources and so we really need to double down and invest to ensuring that students at these schools have access and are able to enroll and computer science I'm going to turn it over to BT now who's going to dig way more into the data with you all um and then uh talk about what we can do with that thanks Hannah yeah give it up for Hannah uh it's a pleasure to be here and to see you all again I'm BT from the computer science Teachers Association um and we have a lot to celebrate as Hannah just shared and I also want to share some things for us to reflect on and hopefully motivate us because we have some persistent Equity gaps who want to discuss first with regards to access which means offering a foundational high school computer science course um this chart shows access by student race and ethnicity and the labels are small but the first four I'll highlight are Native American Alaskan black latinx a native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and they are all less likely to have access to CS at their High School than their uh white and Asian peers and I should also the the good news is all of these bars have risen over the last couple of years so we are making some steady progress here I also want to highlight that these numbers are different than participation which means enrollment in a course for example the first chart the first bar on the left side is 67% of Native Americans have access to high school CS far fewer actually participate in CS that's one of our biggest gaps and there's a phenomenal report from capore Center in Asus just released I'd recommend you read it to learn more about this Equity Gap uh we're going to transition talking about participation so participation is instead enrollment in those High School CS courses and this chart shows enrollment um disagreed by race and ethnicity and over the last three years participation by race ethnicity has been fairly consistent the kind of dark green bar shows the national demographics of that group and the light green bar shows their enrollment in high school CS courses and we see across these that nationally black native Hawaiian multiracial students and white students are proportionately represented to their enrollment in the schools Asian students are over represented and latinx and Native American and Alaskan students are underrepresented and in fact latinx students are pretty likely to attend a high school that offers computer science but they are far less likely to enroll in it there's a strong uh participation Gap here latinx students are 1.4 times less likely than their white indan peers to take foundational CS in high school another persistent Gap is with girls only 31% of young women are enrolled in high school computer science this has been the same over the last few years what that also means is with relative race and ethnicity parity but this gender gap we know that girls of color are most impacted they have that double bind and that means they're far less likely to enroll in CS there are other inequities Beyond race ethnicity gender school size uh so some to highlight some of these other subgroups we know that multilingual Learners students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students are all underrepresented compared to their representation in the school in FAL computer science um some good news the efforts to teach computer science at the K levels have led to less pronounced disparities and this is true across all or most of the trends and one example is with gender so we just showed that 31% of uh girls enroll in high school CS in middle school that number is 44% and in elementary school it's 49% so we see far closer to parity and these group these numbers give an incomplete story and that's because we can see where CS is offered we have data around who takes it but we don't yet know at scale what that experience is like for them because really it matters the interactions between students stents and their teachers so in the report you'll find a number of quotes and stories embedded throughout that try to paint a better picture about what is driving that work and I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the incredible work of the K12 teachers that lead to these changes and are disrupting inequities and are creating inclusive environments for their students that lead them to want to to continue to pursue CS um so I want to take a moment to thank those teachers yeah let's do that um and as the world's largest CS department csda is here to support them and help connect them to other teachers so we welcome you to join our department as well as invite teachers to do the same uh now I'm to turn over to Josh he's going to talk about how to use a report thanks be thanks BT appreciate it and we appreciate the partnership that we have with code.org and csta when it comes to producing this report uh group of us last night went to dinner and then to the sphere how many of y'all went to the sphere or went to some show there we go look at the hands raised and it reminded me or uh really helped me to really double down the fact that CS matters CS education matters and all of us in the room are committed to seeing its growth seeing sustained and seeing more and more students and their families and communities getting impacted and access and participating in computer science and so as thinking about how do we use this report after you've flipped through the pages I don't know about you when you get a nice new book or report I like to sniff it a little bit get that new smell in me what next how do we use it and so I think about the student this the name of the session is the state of Cs in 2030 so I'm thinking that student right now who's in their room or in the classroom they're designing some kind kind of robotic dog or dingo that may go to Google or Microsoft or NSF one day and say I want to fund something like this that could help address and answer some problems that are in society right now so how do we think about this report for what we want to see in the future with cs education well for one you all have a hard copy that you got to registration Hannah said there's more that you can get uh later on there's also a pdf online that you can provide the stakeholders and folks back at home to know more about the data in their state and about the national landscape around CS education including State handouts about your individual State and word it ranks in comparison to other states to a similar size and scope there's also a very unique and very cool data dashboard that's online that provides filters ways in which to access data based on different demographics and your local school so dig into that and you can find that at advocacy. code.org stateof Cs and as you think about this work as we leave Las Vegas later today or tonight on the red eyee how do we think about the work when it comes to expanding capacity how do we think about the work in CS when it comes to access for students how do we think about participation in CS for our students in our schools and most importantly what's the experience of Cs education for students around our country and so thinking of this framework that it guides our work in esep developed by my colleague Carol Fletcher and jce Warner at the University of Texas how do we think think about this work and our work where we're trying to impact what happens in CS classrooms around the country so now after this session after we go home this is where we kick in this is where our advocacy kicks into high gear to seeing the what we want to see in CS education so we got to identify who our audience is that's Educators that's policy makers that's industry leaders and community members students families small business owners all of those that are impacted or impact computer science and so thinking about how will you tailor your message and your message and your group's message in the back to the relevant audience that you want to see engaged in in computer science and most importantly who needs to know more about this report and the data that's embedded within the report and online and in the dashboard to help Advance this work further and then finally how do we Advocate it's not enough to keep what we have gained over the last two and a half days inside our head but how do we Advocate to that community and to that audience once we leave out of these doors and down those convention steps well first you got to ask the question how will you use the data in this report to make sense of the disparities that BT talked so wonderfully about in computer science second what actions and this says team but I want to flip that a little bit what actions will you take to address these disparities that we known about that you've heard over and over again not just here but in other conferences I know it's how our CSS folks work right we go from one week to the next week we gather at State Summit some other week we'll get together at another place right we hear the same thing over and over again so what are we going to do differ when we walk out of this room with this year's report and then finally how will you engage individuals from underrepresented populations to develop strategies in collab cation together not just for them but with them to address some of these deep disparities that we see in CS education again thank you to our partnership with code.org and the computer science Teachers Association for this work I want to give credit to the other Co coauthor who's sitting in the audience Sarah dudon who I get to work with every day I'm G turn it back over to Hannah that all right thank you so much Josh and BT um you know 20 minutes is not enough to talk about a report that took us months to write uh but it's a little a little sneak peek for you all so we have put our contact information up here because the report is the beginning of a conversation please reach out to us we want to hear from you how are you using the report how can we make it better for future years this is a a product of a collaborative Community we want that conversation to continue uh so please I look forward to emails in my inbox uh hopefully not this weekend but maybe next week um so you know there was one other thing that we didn't mention and it wasn't an accident because I didn't want to steal the Thunder from the next folks um but one of the other things that is new this year in the report is AI right we've been talking so much about AI the last few days and how that impacts education but particularly how that impacts Computer Science Education right that is why we're all here and thinking about how we can best equip our teachers and students in computer science education and that includes AI so that iscl included in the report it's mentioned the executive summary in the introduction and it actually has its own section this year where it talks about the changing landscape and some guidelines and Frameworks for States and policy makers so that leads me to introducing the next part of our panel and I'm so excited to welcome on to the stage Patrick oin he is going to be the moderator of the next panel and they're going to be talking all about Ai and how that's going to impact uh the future of Computer Science Education so Patrick I'll welcome you on up to the stage I good morning let's hear it one more time for Hannah BT Josh congratulations on the release of the state ofcs report such a hugely impactful resource for our community and uh really taking to heart that that call to action in terms of you know leveraging this as a resource to go out in the work that we're doing as we leave Las Vegas um um so thank you for that um so yeah I'm Patrick oin I'm director of teacher skills within Microsoft philanthropies we're focused at Microsoft philanthropies on empowering nonprofits and communities with digital and AI capabilities to really Drive inclusive economic growth and So within that team I'm focused and my team is focused on teacher Skilling and so we do that through efforts whether that's free content resources Partnerships with nonprofit organizations like code.org csta csforall and others represented here um and supporting teachers in areas of Cs education AI cyber security and sustainability so just wanted to introduce myself for for folks that I haven't had the opportunity to meet yet so you have a little bit more context on on myself um so I have the privilege of moderating this panel of course we've been talking throughout the week about the impact of AI on education r large and the impact of AI on the workforce um but we haven't had as much of a kind of focused conversation on the impact of AI on CS education specific Al what is the future of Cs education in the context of AI in education what role does CS education play in teaching students to uh learn about how to use AI how to create with AI how to create AI Technologies and also how to do so responsibly and with the ethical impacts of computing uh on society in mind so lots to unpack there we have a fantastic panel lined up three uh individuals with varied perspectives and uh backgrounds that I think we're going to have a great Focus discussion here so first up I'd like to call to the stage Janna de philippus who is the senior program manager for public policy and economic graph at LinkedIn welcome Janna next up we have Jeff Forbes who is the program director for education and Workforce at nsf's uh directorate for computer and information sciences and Engineering I think I got that right please correct me if I miss messed that up and perhaps doesn't need an introduction but I will do so uh nonetheless the cofounder and CEO of code.org hadti partovi welcome hadti all right so I have a range of different questions here some of which I'm GNA ask to to individual panelists others I'll just open it up to to any of you to respond to and we can kind of uh build off the conversation from from one another um there's a chance we may have some opportunity for for questions in the audience although this this panel is a little bit more abbreviated than some of the other plenary panel sessions that we've had uh so so we'll just kind of monitor the time and see what's what's possible but I'd like to start with uh Janna in terms of um you know your work at LinkedIn and the work that your team does you recently published a report back in August um around the future of work uh as it relates to AI the AI impact on future work in a variety of different um uh spaces whether that's the roles that will be impacted how they might be impacted um different skills and how that plays into it so I think really just centering this question around skills and so what what are we hearing or seeing or learning from industry as it relates to the the skills that are needed around uh Ai and specific to CS thank you Patrick and it's great to be here today um let me start by saying that on LinkedIn we're seeing that AI skills are in high demand and growing fast job postings mentioning AI Tech like gbt or chat gbt have shot up 2 one times since this time last year um we're also seeing a high demand for AI skills and Technical roles like software engineer and data scientist the top AI skills we're seeing on the platform include um the software Library tensor flow or the python package pandas as well as some more General AI skills like um data structures or algorithm development um the fastest growing AI skills we're seeing include computer vision classific ation and natural language processing among among others um it's important to note that even for AI jobs so jobs that have ai in the title like AI engineer or head of AI um or require multiple AI skills on their job postings we're seeing a pretty even mix of technical skills and these AI skills specifically as well as people skills or soft skills um skills like communication and ethics um so it would be really important when thinking about teaching um computer science students and preparing them for the workforce that they're getting an education that includes the mix of technical proficiency and some of these other capabilities yeah thanks for that I related to that interestingly I was um I was on a different panel a few months ago and kind of asked a related question and so as prepar preparation for that panel I had gone through uh on the Microsoft career site and just kind of done an informal look at um job descriptions for kind of junior level development positions and I was looking through the skills that were listed in there and so many of them are kind of more of those soft skills that you're talking about around communication collaboration and teamwork um but also being able to read and interpret code and uh things of that nature and and you know of course there's a little bit in there in terms of you know fundamental knowledge and understanding of these data structures algorithms Etc but a lot around like yeah interpretation of code working with others on code um being a key piece of that which I think is kind of reflected in in the report as well one question I have for the kind of the whole group to respond to is just kind of again in the space of thinking about um the skills that we want students to to gain from a a computer science class especially if we're thinking about computer science class in you know 2030 as it was mentioned like we're thinking about the state of Cs in in 2030 you know uh a point of conversation that's come up in this community and in CS education over the last several years is that CS is is more than just programming right there's computational thinking is core to uh to uh to computer science so computational thinking in particular curious to get reactions from from the panelists in terms of do you see that how we think about that evolving um in light of of uh generative AI technology if so how um and how how do we really ensure that students are growing those skills in particular um in the future of Cs so uh yeah I do think that this is a pretty big change and I particularly like what you said uh Patrick about reading code um one of the things uh computational thinking uh was uh first uh uh at termed I guess by our uh prior director from NSF who really wanted to think about you know what are the key things that everyone needs to learn in our society today given that how much computation drives everything and it's really amazing that like a lot of that still applies today but there has been a real big shift right and I think there's going to be even bigger shift as we go forward into 2030 uh one of the anecdotes I like is a tweet where someone said they saw someone in a cafe who was just programming on their laptop without using any AI code generation tools it's like what's the matter with this person it's like seeing someone mow along with scissors like what like what's going on but I do think um you know we do look at uh what's happening across the country and um while we code and trying to think about code and trying to do a lot of the other things we expect in competitional thinking are expected it's uh there's a whole lot more that's people trying to write code people trying to solve particular problems and I think we're going to see a lot more in getting back to a lot of the uh tenants of competitional thinking you know what are how do we decompose problems how do we think about the impact of what's Happening how do we uh how are we able to ask questions about the data that we have and then know whether those answers are correct I think there's a lot that we're going to learn as we move forward uh with our new great tools hi everybody I have a lot of thoughts on this question so I don't know how to answer briefly um the first thing I want to say relative to what J shared about the skills on LinkedIn is I think you know today's job descriptions about AI talk about specific AI skills for an AI job uh but when it comes to the types of jobs people post on LinkedIn we are quickly moving to the point where every single job will have an expectation that you use AI because every single software tool out there is going to be adopting some form of AI so if you use Salesforce as a salesperson Salesforce is going to be using AI to pregenerate emails that you send to people uh if you use Photoshop as a graphic designer that already now has generative Ai and it's going to be almost redundant to say that you need to know how to use the AI aspects of Photoshop and using AI is going to be part of basic digital literacy but when we think about computer science in AI there's probably the greatest change um you know people have done surveys of of folks asking what Industries or What professions are going to be the most impacted by generative AI number one is software engineering number two is teaching so the combination of teaching and computer science is sort of at this Vortex of change because it both involves changing what we teach and involves changing how we teach it uh and both of those things are are quite relevant um the and what i' also want to add is that generative AI is just a part of an evolution and is a fast moving Target so just thinking around how does what we have seen in the last 12 months impact CS education for 10 years from now isn't enough because there's going to be this ongoing effort by the people creating these AI tools to add a greater level of critical thinking problem solving reasoning removing bias removing misinformation all the flaws we currently see there's somebody or teams of people working to remove those flaws uh and so it's going to be challenging and keep up with that but what is definitely clear is that the rot work of sort of coding is going to be reduced and the more sort of computational thinking work of break down problems or abstraction those are going to be increased uh even though code.org is called code.org uh as people who use our platform know that almost all the coding we teach is using blocks um using the blockly language which is how you learn the algorithmic thinking and ignore frankly or never even see the syntax because the syntax is going to be increasingly less important uh and So within CS education teaching how AI works and using that a AI to to solve problems is is going to rise in importance um the actual nittygritty of where did the semicolon go and you close your parentheses those are going to be less and less the things we deal with which I actually think makes programming much much more accessible uh and focuses on things like the creativity and the things that engage humans rather than the things that make it sort of nerdy and difficult yeah great insights thank you perhaps we'll see even kind of more block coding to your point there as as we get into to you know visioning to 2030 where the emphasis on introduction to computer science really leverages that even more as a a way to teach those uh computational thinking algorithmic thinking as well um and I like your point too hottie in terms of the impact on on teaching and software engineering and and and to to kind of build into that uh some of the conversations that have also come up that doesn't mean that that teachers and software Engineers necessarily are losing their job it's changing how those jobs are uh are working and that's I think an important point to to underscore as well um my next question is for Jeff um specifically and it's around just kind of if there's any early research just within your your work stream that you've seen uh into the use of generative AI in the highered space you know at the the maybe cs1 uh intro level CS courses where uh there's been experimentation with integration of of generative AI uh tools into those classes or any anything you've been hearing from that community of uh higher education faculty as it relates to lessons that that the K12 sector could could learn from yeah uh there're actually been a remarkable amount of work done over the past year it turns out uh and it's difficult because it is such a moving Target but I think some of the lessons that we get there was a uh uh working group at the international computer science conference and uh Computer Science Education conference excuse me uh and you know what did they find well you turns out these tools work right they work really well uh for introductory uh programming right so what do I mean when I say that they work well they help students uh complete the tasks they make sure they complete the task and their Solutions are better um they're of course able to do it in less time but what's also remarkable is that you would think well um they're not able to maybe understand as much as one might think but they've even had studies where uh they had a group of uh students aged 10 through 17 working on projects and half had access to uh AI code generation tools and half didn't um the ones who did have access to the AI uh generation tools of course you know did the assignments very well and did them quicker but also when they had to do things like code modification without the AI generation tool they did it just as well and when you ask them about uh doing the test not on the uh tool they did just as well in fact uh they in some cases uh did better especially if they this was a a camp that was in Python if they had prior scratch experience it turned out that that actually uh allowed them to use the tools even better now it is key that we think about how we teach in these environments right that it's not just about you know what we're teaching but how we teach and how we prepare to teach what the resources are that we're going to be providing students and there's been a lot of work on that and a lot of work also looking at how um faculty are trying to address these issues because as you can imagine there's a variety of levels of comfort with this right I imagine you all have to do an incredible amount to update uh a lot of the great tools that you already have out there that's asking a lot of uh curriculum developers are asking a lot of Faculty but I do think this is really an opportunity based on all the research that we're seeing that this does have a substantial impact um but it does appear that you still do want people to take these classes because the impact does get less the higher up the curriculum you're going right so now that may change because one of the things we're finding are the newer tools are better than the old tools but it does seem to be the case that you do want to learn some of these things because if you want to succeed in some of the later courses you do need uh currently at least uh to have gone through these introduction classes which have some of the same learning objectives before but now you're incorporating AI Tools in as one of the things that students and teachers are using yeah thanks for that Jee and I think kind of going up to the from highed to Industry there's actually been some interesting research that that GitHub has done related to the use of the GitHub copilot technology kind of code assistance technology uh leveraging generative Ai and they've found in their early research of developers that are using that tool that not only are they producing code more more quickly but there's also in terms of the sentiments of the developers that are using the tools that they're finding themselves more fulfilled by the work that they're doing because they're putting aside some of the more uh timec consuming menial tasks and able to focus their time on what really matters to them so kind of just building on some of the the pieces that you were seeing in the research at the higher ed space as well Jeff um curious to kind of zoom in like for this exercise of future of Cs in in 2030 and hotti I was particularly interested to get your perspective on this question of like if we're sitting in a in a computer science class you know seven years from now um what what do you think that would look like from a pedagogical perspective um you know what a lot of I think for most of us that have been in a computer science class or computer science teachers ourselves a lot of time spent students at their computers coding um do you expect that to to continue to be the case or how do you think uh things will will will evolve in that classroom setting uh in terms of instruction and pedagogy and just how students are spending their time I'm really curious to get your your thoughts on that I know you mentioned previously hottie in terms of like wrote work uh being reduced and there was a comment earlier from Jeff I think about like code reading more than code writing um so kind of pulling together a few threads curious to to get your your vision and thoughts there hottie um I didn't know this question was coming so I have to think about my answer and I also would say I don't want my answer to carry too much weight because I'm coming up with it right now this isn't like the sevenyear plan for code. Works work no worries any members of my team in the room this isn't like our our our sevenyear agenda um i' first say nobody knows exactly what things are going to be like in seven years I'm not sure at any point you could predict that but with this pace of change it's quite difficult uh so I can the things I'm most sure of are the trends I mentioned which is learning more about how AI works and learning more how to use Ai and learning less about rote repetitive stuff uh uh you know the reduction of rote and repetitive work in computer science isn't a new trend you know uh when my father was learning it computer science involved punching holes in cardboard you know and to represent ones and zeros uh and you know right before I went to college people were learning an assembly language because that was the the the primary way you learned and each decade typing code has become closer and closer to English uh and we're going to continue on that path um I expect blockbased programming will actually increase and you know syntactical coding will be will decrease because it'll be more like oh not everybody needs to do that um in fact I wouldn't be surprised if the generative tools for coding generate block looking stuff and you don't need to look at the stuff underneath because that's the part that the computer definitely has has done a better job of um uh one thing I think I mentioned a couple days ago I especially think HTML coding is going to drop in in sort of what you teach in a high school or middle school class because jobs in HTML coding are also going to just generally those are going to be things that tools like canva or other tools just automatically generate HTML for us uh in the same way that Assembly Language coding is not something people do um the the one thing I'd say that I'll probably you know every time I think about it slightly blows my own mind and I'm not sure whether this is in four years or seven years or 10 uh but if you if you try the current chat GPT audio like UI where you can speak to it and it speaks back and you're not typing it just it's speaking um that's already here today we're not very far from a point where your an AI teacher can be sort of a person that you speak to that looks like like a person it could even have the visuals of like it could be me you know somebody did a 3D scan of me in a in a measure of my voice or or you know any any celebrity or Tech leader or whatever that is your teacher and you speak to them and it speaks to you uh as it and this is not just in CS education all of Education there's this opportunity to have a real AI tutor not like a chat bot that types and you need to read what it says uh and I suspect we'll see things like that before the end of this decade how that impacts all of Education uh I'm certain that the role of a teacher will continue to become more of a facilitator and a coach and the role of a curriculum developer is going to be more of using this kind of AI to basically uh not just deliver information but deliver interactive teaching and coaching and that's going to be wild in its impacts but I think it'll increase equity and it'll give a a much broader set of people access to the best educators thank you yeah sorry to put you on the spot there with that one but I appreciate the answer and agree in terms of the the pace of change and how much that's impacting the entire education community and um how you know we all here in this room and and others other leaders in education CS education Ai and education really need to support the community in adapting to to these technological changes um to support our students um you mentioned Equity there at the end HTI I just want to kind of Bring It uh conversation to that that space for the the whole panel to respond to as as you choose um you know we saw from the state of Cs report uh that there's been improvements in there's uh in terms of equity and access um some some lags in some cases uh that were called out in terms of participation so obviously we're all well familiar with uh the the persistent e Equity gaps that have existed within Computer Science Education the technology industry at large um and just curious to hear from the panelists in terms of you know both both the opportunities that that are presented which I think you were just touching on hottie but also um there are risks to to equity um you know with past technological innovations uh that have widened Equity gaps and so uh definitely a concern of of everyone here I know um so just your thoughts on on the risks the opportunities um of AI as it relates to CS education and equity in CS education I can start on this one um I just wanted to um point to what hadti said about gener helping create access accessibility to um coding in terms of ensuring that students have more time for the deeper thinking and planning and computational thinking and less time on the more rotary tasks involved in coding I think that's a great Point um I'd add to it that we're starting to see the potential for genev AI in helping students who may face barriers to traditional learning methods um that that can gen can be a tool in helping individualize learning um in terms of risks um as as luden the question we already have um Equity gaps and Cs and an AI specifically our own data from LinkedIn earlier this year shows that in the AI field um it is still very over represented by men for example 70% male to 30% female um and it is so important that um these roles are diverse um to ensure that the impacts of AI Tech technology um that there are no negative impacts for underrepresented groups so this is a really critical point um the last thing I'll say on this is that our research at LinkedIn looks at um the overall impact of AI on the workforce um think Patrick you alluded to it in in the introduction of our report um and what we're seeing is that women and younger workers are over represented in jobs that stand to see the most immediate impacts of gen on their jobs um so it's really important that um computer science students and professionals who are working on this technology are also thinking about those impacts and that educators are thinking about how to um train and teach future Generations in the workforce on learning skills um as their jobs May evolve with Gen technology so uh yeah I'm very concerned about like how do we make sure this is going to narrow gaps rather than make them bigger and I think there are a lot of reasons to worry about perhaps the gaps getting bigger um prior to being at NSF I uh talk computer science uh at Duke University in North Carolina for 19 years and one of the things we saw is just the impact of Preparatory privilege right if you have prior experience in what that means in terms of what you're able to do when you get there and that could be become even larger with access to these tools and we're even seeing some places where uh there are things happening in high schools that really are making things worse for example at one school they uh cut off access uh to uh chat GPT so you couldn't go through the school's uh computers but then the students who had the ability to tether to their phones were still able to get access to chat GPT so instead of actually trying to level the playing field what they did was uh allow folks who had access to hotpots to be able to do more um so uh don't do that um and uh but I do think there are great opportunities as well um we are seeing work where uh one of the big problems on the University level is capacity right we don't have enough capacity in terms of teaching assistants and professors to work with all the students and some uh there are already some uh Educators who are creating really good like uh helper Bots that do a much better job than honestly our taas and faculty were doing in terms of giving high quality immediate responses that help people with the problem that they're working on so uh I am hopeful but I do think that this is going to require a real dedication on everyone's part to make sure that we're narrowing the gaps I similarly see sort of both sort of risks and also opportunities but I'm way more optimistic about the opportunities and that's much more because I think about the longterm not necessarily the you know last year schools ban chat gbt which was I think a a big mistake I I suspect when we look 10 years from now the rise of all AI tools but especially generative AI is going to be something we look back as having been one of the greatest equalizers in education uh and the reason I say that first first of all is the access is increasingly going to be anybody who has a phone which is uh and phones already reach a very very large percentage of the global population and and that's only going to increase I also would say when I think about Equity I don't just think in the United States if you think globally there are places that just the entire country barely teaches computer science for example but access to a phone suddenly will have will provide you access to a personalized uh tutor and uh if you think about not just where CS is taught versus it's not taught that's going to be easier with with these new tools and then there's places where it's taught in places where it's taught poorly the quality of of education is also going to go up because more and more the as the role of the teacher becomes that of a coach or facilitator everybody will have an much higher quality sort of uh content experience and we already see that with the work that code.org has done for example part of why access to computer science is more equitable is the money we put into training teachers but part of it is because we've created a curriculum that allows a history teacher to begin teaching computer science uh because the history teacher doesn't need to be a CS expert because our curriculum and our videos and so on carry some of that weight and that has enabled an equitable spread of access when an AI tutor does even more than code.org videos or curriculums do that will actually increase the equity Equitable access and the it'll widen the the gap between those who do or don't have access to basic digital Hardware but I believe the more value we put into that digital Hardware the more our e our global economy is going to spread access as we see with smartphones the more powerful smartphones get the more people end up having them yeah thank you just completely agree with all the panelists there in terms of just this broader theme of the the great opportunities that do exist and uh for differentiated learning personalized learning um to to Really extend that opportunity to some more students uh and and appreciate you calling out you know the global considerations as well they're hottie um but while also being very cognizant and mindful of the um the risks of of widening gaps as well I think we've got time maybe just for one last question here uh before we call wrap up the panel um I want to talk a little bit about uh responsible Ai and just the the the role that CS education has to ensure that um and this kind of has two two elements to it both the responsible use of AI um but also the responsible development of AI systems um and you know for future AI developers out there and just kind of what role um you know foundational CS classes should play in in ensuring that that's part of the the curriculum or um more broadly as we think about CS education and the the um interplay of responsible use of Technology maybe at large uh not just AI but any any thoughts or reactions there um so uh NSF we're respons responsible for uh trying to broaden participation of the Computing research community and I think that becomes more important because we really need I mean these technologies have a much broader impact than they used to but I also wanted to say I'm seeing that this has been a great opportunity in that the impact of technology was always like meaningful and not necessarily always like you know nice and with AI it's foregrounded everyone wants to have a conversation about it because it's real easy to see the problems and everyone wants to have the discussions about ethics that before I think we a little abstract but now I think these are things that are impacting students lives impacting their fam's lives and people want to engage so I really think this is a great opportunity for us as a community just going to say that um you know I think definitely students should be learning responsible AI in terms of if they're going to be developing these Technologies pointing back to the diversity Stat or lack there of diversity in the AI field so that's really critical but also I'd say WID spread AI literacy um the broader understanding of what is this technology what are are the differential impacts what are the biases that may exist and being able to comprehend that so whether these students will go on to actually design these algorithms or be on the consumer side using them as hadti mentioned in Salesforce or in other software where they will be um I think that's also really critical so first of all I agree with Jeff that you know teaching about societal impacts has been a part of computer science in the last uh couple decades you know pre AI uh you know the csta standards for many years have included sort of learning about the societal impacts of Technology as part of learning computer science you know with with great power comes great responsibility and we should be teaching students not only what a computer could do but what it should do uh and with AI it is a superpower for anybody who has computer science skills AI basically doubles those skills and so it doubles the necessity of making sure we teach students how to use it at you know for for positive social impact and as Educators I would say when it comes to responsibility our responsibility to democratize access to this education is even greater because the the abilities of somebody who knows computer science have just basically increased generative AI coding has always been a superpower but coding with AI is now like a double or triple superpower and that's a superpower that needs to be in the hands of everybody uh we we none of us want a world where a very small percentage of of the population are creating the tools and technologies that everybody else are just blindly using we should all envision a society where every human being has the knowledge to to maximize their own personal potential as creators and that's our our number one responsibility as educators of computer science what a fantastic note to end on because we are at time thank you panelists appreciate you all thank you audience for your engagement I pass it back to Hannah all right let's give a hand up for that great panel everyone well so while this is the last time we're all going to be together in this room don't leave yet we have two great sessions still happening this morning both at 1000 a.m. and 1100 a.m. um including some really great lesson demos so please stay and enjoy that um if you've not yet picked up a hard copy of the state FCS report I don't know what you're waiting for we've got plenty out there I'll be sad if I have to take a lot home I don't want that so please make sure to swing by and grab that we also have state handouts uh so please uh grab one if you want to grab one for a colleague um as Josh mentioned this is such a crucial tool to Advocate uh so please take it home uh to your home community and and use it to get more computer science of have a few other housekeeping things uh check out of your rooms by 11 a.m. please we do not want the hotel to get mad at us we do have luggage storage downstairs right by the escalators in the St James room so if you need to run up quickly and grab your suitcase you can bring it down there um and we have several lost and found items some stray glasses some stray cords so make sure to swing by the registration desk to grab all of that but thank you so much for a wonderful CS edcon
