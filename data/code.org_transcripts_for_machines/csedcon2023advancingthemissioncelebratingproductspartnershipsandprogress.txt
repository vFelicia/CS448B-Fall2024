my name is Karina I'm an international Partnerships manager at code.org I lead the work for Latin America where are the people from Latin America by the way Make Some Noise thank you so much uh this afternoon we are going to celebrate new product releases and organizations that are advancing computer science around the world please join me in welcoming welcoming sorry Sam shorts senior product manager at c.org to preview some exciting NE products hi every hi hi hi hi everybody I'm Sam Schwarz and I'm a product manager at code.org my team is responsible for ensuring that we have excellent free courses and tools for students all over the world and as the world thank you and as the world is being transformed by AI we want to make sure that we are properly preparing students for that new world today I'm going to share some exciting recent developments code.org has made to our products to advance this Mission code.org has deeply invested in AI taking a holistic cross organizational approach in addition to the T initiative which I know you all have heard a lot about we've been building curriculum and platform services that teach and leverage AI for our curriculum we aim to provide IND indry leading AI education for both primary and secondary schools on how AI Works how to leverage Ai and the ethical and societal impacts of AI and I am honored to be here today to share some of my colleagues work and what they've done to provide fun and engaging AI curiculum over the past several months as many of you may have seen this summer we launched an AI 101 teachers learning series with several sessions to help teachers understand Ai and how to bring it into their classrooms throughout these five sessions we've reached over 20,000 teachers across the globe this fall we launched a post AP Computer Science application module that offers high school students handson experience with professional software development tools including GitHub and GitHub copilot to teach Real World skills in computer vision and working directly with AI assisted code throughout this module students are getting handson experience with the same AI tools that the and processes that industry Engineers are using we also launched our how AI work series to provide classrooms with a set of videos and accommodating inclassroom lessons on how AI works these videos range from neural networks to generative images to algorithmic bias and the range of lessons give teachers a flexible approach to how they introduce AI to their students and this year we are going to be introducing these lessons in 12 different languages coming soon finally we were really excited for those of you who attended this morning to demo our pilot modules this morning as part of computer science connections which integrates computer science into other core subjects our English language arts module gives English teachers a way to introduce generative AI into their classrooms students interact with different chatbot personas to help in different parts of the writing process such as drafting or revising or copy editing in our history module we bring AI to students and teach them how to compare traditional research methods with researching using AI both of these modules are not chatbot specific but instead we built to be customized by teachers for their classrooms and their standards and their goals code.org is leading the way and introducing AI to every student in every subject for our platforms and services we aim to carefully leverage AI to close learning gaps at scale helping teachers to be more effective in the classroom and giving students powerful new tools for learning computer science this year for hour of code we're excited to introduce students to the power of creativity with AI today I'm going to give you all a sneak peek of how we are integrating AI into code.org dance party students will learn the basics of computer science by creative creating these cute interactive dancers but we'll also work with AI to create their perfect dance party effect right now you this group is going to get the first ever look at our new dance party AI Edition extremely hot off the presses Last Night Roll the tape students will be able to prompt the AI with their favorite emoji and while they're picking their emojis which I've been in a few classroom tests and this is like the most fun thing that they've ever done in their whole life um everyone's asking for more emojis they'll prompt the AI with their emojis and then they will be able to generate new backgrounds AI will watch or students will watch watch ai go through the decisionmaking process of evaluating which effects most closely associate with the emojis that they picked it's going through finding the best ones oh it didn't play the whole thing oh there you go once it's generated students will be able to view the code that AI generated as well as see a deeper view into why the AI picked what it picked based on the different emojis and then they'll be able to use the effect and use it in their dance party how fun yay we are super excited to bring this to classrooms all across the world because we will also be translating this tutorial into 12 different languages every year one of our top pain points we hear from teachers is that it's very difficult to assess student learning and again for the first time I am super thrilled to give you all a look into our brand new AI teaching assistant integrated directly into our code.org platform our AI teaching assistant will provide initial assessments of student work providing a starting point for teachers AI teaching assistant will decrease the time spent for repetitive assessments oh is it not playing oh wait a second it's very cool I promise and I'll keep going with my Spiel AI teaching assistant will decrease the time spent on repetitive assessments and allow teachers to focus on personalized feedbacks for students that need it the most just this month we released this pilot that eventually you'll see in a second um across the country and we're super excited to learn how this is going to impact both students and teachers in the classroom Casey can we play the video technical error uh it's not playing right now so we'll try to go back to it in a second Sam sorry okay that's okay it's frozen has everyone been having fun at CS edcon I have all right let's see awesome yay so this is our AI teacher assistant integrated directly into our platform it's evaluating the student work and giving teachers recommendations and confidence score of how confident the AI is on the recommendation but the AI isn't giving any student grades without teachers going in checking doublechecking what the AI has done um but we hope that this makes life easier for teachers when they're just doing like very repetitive tasks and make sure they can really focus on the places where they need to give personalized feedback to students awesome thank you yay lastly imagine a world where every student has an OnDemand judgementfree personal guide for their computer science courses um well I'm excited to announce that we are working on an AI tutor we believe that this will increase the sense of belonging and confidence among students and offer personalized learning support regardless of student need thinking back to my own experience being one of the only women in my intruded computer science course it was super intimidating to ask questions that I thought would make me look stupid in front of my peers but an AI tutor would have been the perfect way to make me feel confident in my computer science skills both inside and outside of the classroom we are currently in development so I don't have a fun video unfortunately but we hope to have a pilot by Spring 2024 so hopefully have something to show you next year's CS edcon thank you so much for your time and I look forward to seeing what we can create to increase the success of computer science learning for everyone hello again Amazon has been a crucial partner for us at go.org they sponsored our initial dance party and now the one that Sam just shared with you all we are glad to welcome haa Barbo and pedo mayard Jang to preview some of the new programs coming from the Amazon future engineer welcome hila and pedo hello oh it works awesome yeah good hi everyone I'm hila like hila uh and I yes I have to do that uh I come to this work as a former middle school science and computer science teacher I'm now a senior product manager at Amazon future engineer and I'm padrio a child of Jamaican immigrants I discovered computers in my nth grade Math Science History classroom where I taught myself basic fell in love with computers and eventually became a CS professor and AI software development engineer at Amazon now I lead research for Amazon future engineer so we want to start with a flash back to 2013 in New Orleans Louisiana who that anybody no okay maybe few yes right there let's go Louisiana uh this is a picture of my class as we completed the very first hour of code and my students absolutely loved it thank you code.org uh afterwards my students all wanted to connect with someone who worked in technology they wanted to figure out how they could follow in their footsteps the problem was that none of us in my class myself included actually knew anyone who worked in Tech or in software I was unable to make that role model connection for them and my students were not alone in this struggle as many teachers in this room know in fact 36% of students base their career aspirations off people they know only 1% base their career aspirations off someone visiting their school for students in underserved and underrepresented communities like my students this is grim news it appears that at times pursuing a career is more about who you know than what you know or what you're interested in at Amazon future engineer we aim to change this our team's goal is to leverage Amazon's assets people business technology to prepare all students especially those from underserved and under represented backgrounds to pursue the careers of the future we do this by funding computer science science education initiatives and by providing scholarships and internships in engineering at Amazon and in the past year with we been doubling down on a new Focus Area Career exploration and role model access so how have we been approaching career exploration so far well we are very much in the beginnings of this so please know that uh and one of the first things we decided to do was look for opportunities to directly connect students to someone who works at Amazon through externships career days and virtual class career talks to date over 200,000 students have directly connected to an Amazon professional through these free programs second due to teacher requests we've also started to build out a free virtual interactive field trip program that takes students behind the scenes at Amazon to explore the technology and the careers of the future students can Journey inside an AWS data center follow Alexa into space tour one of our robotics facilities and while they're there they get to learn about the careers that help make that technology possible over 750,000 students have completed a career tour with 86% reporting interest in the future careers after the tour as we listened to students and Educators and started piloting these programs a research question quickly emerged what career should we be featuring only software development Engineers or should we show the art side HR recruiters the management side what about technicians or equipment installers who may not have bachelor's degrees to answer this question we embarked on a research project and we're excited to share um to share a few of our findings from that with you we partnered with Gallup to create a careers of the future index we looked at the 529 different job description categories used by Census Bureau and developed a way to rank these jobs according to categories uh which will matter most in the future one salary two job growth three job demand and four resistance to automation we gave each of the 529 jobs a score according to these criteria and weighted them according to what we believe matter most based on student and educator discussions and the literature this is open data so you can access and wait differently yourselves as well so drum roll the top 20 careers of the future that only require a bachelor's degree woo there they are okay do a quick scan and you'll notice a trend here 12 of the top 20 are in engineering wow Amazon future engineer I get it cool awesome fascinating also probably not surprising to anyone in this room and if we expand that to stem skills more broadly we see that it's actually more like 18 of the top 20 if you're in here and you're in PR marketing for fund reason you squeaked on by great work and if we look at jobs that don't require a bachelor's degree uh we see the same Trend over half of the top 20 jobs of the future not requiring a college degree are in stem or stem trades for Amazon this reinforces our belief that computer science and stem literacy are essential ingredients to Preparing students for the careers of the future our research report dives into many other questions regarding these careers in the interest of time I'll quickly highlight two that we believe are important to our Collective work together first how do these care careers align to students career plans the answer is they don't in 2018 Pisa asked 15yearolds what careers they expect to pursue the most e economically viable careers are less popular Among Us teens computers and math architecture and engineering are some of the most viable with a CFI score of 90 plus but rank among the least mentioned among among students today students who rank entertainment and media so highly often do not even know they can work in these careers while in technology for example the tech jobs enabling Thursday night NFL on Prime our our research also looked at how representation by gender and race shows up across these careers here's just one tidbit for you the career with the largest gap in representation by race and also with a large gap in gender is software developer collectively we have a lot to do in this space to make access to computer science related careers more Equitable so now we have another question but this question is for you all what should we industry schools curriculum writers profits what should we do this with this data how should it impact the products we build the programs we run the policies we pass at Amazon future engineer we believe that new thought leadership is needed in this space from all our Collective organizations in order to unlock the careers of the future for all students and we are really excited to announce uh that a new partnership with the computer science teacher Association uh specifically dedicated to thinking about this question of career exploration but we challenge everyone in this room to please join us in this Quest if our Collective goal all of us is to change who has access to those CS jobs then we have to provide both the education to build the skills and the opportunities for career exploration and role model access thank you so much for joining us today uh the research we mentioned you can download at Amazon futur engineer.com resesarch uh you can also take a look at our newly published research around the impact of Role Models uh so we look forward to working with you all on this big problem and please don't be a stranger thank you so much
