I got my first computer when I was in sixth grade it just unlocks all these different possibilities we live in this time now where by solving relatively basic problems you can improve millions of people's lives and it's really inspiring so I like going for walks around I it's it's California right so it's that's beautiful and there were these few kids who they they'd ride their bikes and and every day when i' when I'd walk by this one um this one guy he'd ask me just like yell questions like hey um Mr Zuckerberg like Mr Zuckerberg what um I want I want to learn how to program what should what should I do a few days later I'd come back and like all right I got the developer kit and my mom says I I I I can get it um so now what's the what's the first thing that I should get started doing so I'm like all right well first try to learn this and then like this would just go on for weeks and I I can't say I didn't teach him how to program but um but it was really gratifying to know that um in some small way maybe I could help out um teaching the next generation of folks who are going to become engineers when I think about what we're going be teaching in schools 5 10 15 years from now I I definitely think that computer science or at least basic programming is going to be as important of a skill as um being able to do basic reading and writing um and I think we're going to look back and and wonder why it took us so long to get to that point
