this lesson is called the big event it's all about how we can control our programs and actually change the way a program runs on the fly using events like the push of a button or the click of a mouse for this lesson you'll be controlled with a paper remote control yeah it's just like a real live video game an event is an action that causes something to happen it's like when you click the button on a mouse and a webpage loads that's an event when you touch your screen on a tablet to scroll that's an event also events are a great way of letting the user direct your program whenever they need or want to you know they're there things that that that happened that we all respond to we we feel hungry and we go to the fridge we hear the mailman come and he puts our mail in the mailbox and then we go get our mail those are just like the events of pushing a button or moving a joystick they are something that happens that triggers us to do something most people who program video games there's just there's just one event that everyone calls update and it happens 30 or 60 times a second and so for video game programmers that's almost more important as an event than the buttons are the joystick because what we tend to do is the main event we're watching for is that tic happening and then we check the joystick in the tic so we say oh has somebody pushed the button this frame yes or no without events you couldn't you know the player couldn't move he couldn't couldn't your player couldn't jump you wouldn't be able to control what's going on the video game wouldn't be able to animate anything because it's only because of the events of time passing that we're able to to make animations things move
