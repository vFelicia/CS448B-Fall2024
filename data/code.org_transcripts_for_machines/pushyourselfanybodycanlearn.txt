I started playing basketball... Tennis. Football. ...futbol when I was a kid. Getting really good at something isn't easy. It takes persistence and hard work. It takes years of commitment. Success isn't just about training your body it's also about training your mind. Your body and brain get stronger when you push yourself. I didn't always know I'd be a basketball champion. You don't always know what your future will be. The winners of tomorrow will be the creators. The ones with the skills to make their dreams real. What do you want your future to look like? What do you want to create? Whose lives can you impact? If you can dream it you can do it. You can bring any idea to life. It's not going to be easy. It takes time and determination like anything else. You'll make mistakes, you'll get better. You'll get stronger and you will succeed. Push yourself (repeats) Anybody can learn. Just give it a try.
