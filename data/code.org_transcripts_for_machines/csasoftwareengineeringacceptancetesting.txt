hi i'm jessica i'm a software engineer at code.org hi i'm judy and i'm a software engineer at snap acceptance testing is making sure that the code that's been written and the feature that's been built is at a quality that is good for the user we never fully roll out a product unless it has been fully tested out first you never want your users to be the first people to test your code because it will be broken you write some code and you know the ins and outs of it and then the next day someone else comes in and looks at your code and adjusts it or makes something new without tests there's a very good chance that they will unintentionally break something that you wrote testing is a continuous process we do vigorous testing we have to make sure that it does what it's supposed to do and so every single day this code gets deployed to a test environment which is a clone of our production environment once the project is ready to get tested we make sure we announce that to our quality assurance engineers qa engineers are also software engineers but they focus more on quality assurance that's what qa stands for testing is done in a group it's a very collaborative environment the good thing about sharing that around to a bunch of different people is now a lot of different people know the way it's supposed to work how we decide on what to test is basically engineers work with product manager closely to make sure all the requirements are defined test cases are defined so that lqa engineers can follow finding a bug is you know really a process of searching something breaks someone will notice it'll affect someone's day we really have to give it up to our qa teams though because they're the ones who are literally testing every single day to ensure that our product remain at the highest quality that it can be there's this piece called beta testing as well we have an idea of something that we want to build and there's a set of people who are going to try it out first who didn't work on building it who don't know it so well as we do in that test sessions we're involved are usually the engineers building the products so they can answer any questions people who are testing have testing allows us to detect a lot of things like are the business requirements meant do we have good performance is it secure do we handle data correctly it's the only way to ensure a customer and users happiness if you didn't test everything would be broken all the time
