computer science is important to me because it's ubiquitous and if our students don't have the understanding of how it works how to use it or how to create with it then our students will be behind the world computer science is important to me as a state chief because I have the opportunity to Usher forward what our students need most now we know that it's important to educate students today for what they're going to be doing 10 20 50 years from now computer science is going to be the base of that Talent is distributed equally across my state across this nation but unfortunately access and opportunity is not and it is our responsibility as state leaders as District leaders as department leaders to ensure that we open up more opportunities for Access and not only have access but the outcome and what they learn in in the classrooms we need to make sure that it's of high quality that they can Implement they can see themselves moving on to postsecondary or directly into the workforce that's the beauty of it from the earliest days kindergarten on up if students are able to learn about coding and have an awareness of the opportunities not just for jobs in our state but jobs across the globe that they can be a part of that's our responsibility to provide them those opportunities when we hear excitement from principals and students and parents and we have responsibility to follow that passion I know it's hard particularly when it's viewed as added yet another thing on the table so to speak but I would argue that computer science could also function as a significant Catalyst to advance the system we're engaging students some who were not engaged before whenever we can get students involved in HandsOn and things that they really enjoy our high school graduation rate goes up to 98 from 84 percent computer science is one of those things where you can really put your state your districts you can put them on the map you can set a direction for the future and I think that's a great legacy for any of our state leaders if you learn a little bit you want to learn a lot more I would just really encourage State leaders especially to be inspired by that notion by that Curiosity that drives us all I don't think that there's a way you can lean in too far on computer science as a leader it is core to our competitiveness as a global leader a global space and computer science will will continue to push us forward and so it is time to be bold
