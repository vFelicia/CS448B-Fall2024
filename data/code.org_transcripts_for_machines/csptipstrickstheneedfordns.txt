at the beginning of this unit students address the need for computers to have numeric addresses in order for messages to be routed properly to the destination but when humans open a web browser and want to request web page data from a computer we fortunately don't have to know or remember the numeric ip addresses for the server we can just type in www.code.org and our computer is somehow able to request the data from the right computer in this and the following lesson students will learn about the domain name system or dns a hierarchical system and protocol that maps human readable domain names such as code.org to the actual ip address of the computer serving the webpage dns is considered hierarchical because not all domain name servers in the system need to know about every single mapping from domain name to ip address for example there are certain servers that are responsible for the.org domain which know about the dns server is responsible for the subdomains under it this lesson primarily addresses concepts that fall under the csp big idea of the internet the getting started activity for this lesson is a bit more involved than usual and has you and your students up and moving around here's your worksheet for today and here's your ip address as your students walk in hand them each one of the ipa address cutouts and instruct them not to share the number with anyone else to kick off the activity let students know that their task is to get a complete mapping of everyone in the class's name with their ip address everybody grab a pen or a pencil and we're gonna you're gonna walk and talk to each other and you each have an ip address your job is to figure out everybody else's ip address in the room so you can write down their name and the ip address on their sheet now you can talk to each other one at a time and when you do you can exchange as much information as you want so if one of you already knows somebody else's you can exchange a whole bunch of them but you can only talk to one person at a time all right ready go for it i have an ikea address 205.22 during the activity you will be covertly tapping the students on the shoulder one by one taking their current ip address and giving them a new one never mind this will cause their mappings to quickly become out of date and it will be difficult to get the latest information but i just gave it to like six people that is sorry it changes they change here's the new one it may not take long for students to get the point of the activity and reach an appropriate level of frustration once that happens bring the class together for a quick discussion the important points to draw out of the conversation are that number one ip addresses change all the time as your phone moves around with you you are constantly connecting to different routers and therefore getting a new ip address even servers serving up web pages like code.org can change ip addresses if its internet service provider changes number two having a centralized mapping for host names to ip addresses is better and more efficient design than having everyone keep a local mapping which can become out of date quickly having experienced firsthand the pain of not having a centralized system students will be well prepared to watch the dns section of the ipdns video to plug in the unplugged warmup activity direct students to the internet simulator for the lesson in pairs but have pairs split up across the room so they can't talk to each other in person so you should see your partner and a yellow dns node although pairs will be connected to the same router in this version of the tool students won't be able to see the ip addresses of their partner so you're here you're monica 3 and you want to send a message to brad ford but you don't know his ip address so that's there right right it's question mark we don't know it yet okay but you do know the ip address of the dns so what we're going to do is send a message to dns and we're going to find out from dns what his address is the dns server in the simulator responds to requests formatted with a very specific protocol so you have to put get and then the host name and host name is going to be brad's address is it red four brad four yep it's get and then a space and then the host name of the person and if you look in the router diagram over here you can see the hostname is madi9 the server will respond to the ip with the ip address of the hostname requested which students can use to communicate with their partner to fill out a basic questionnaire it understood you so it told you brad's address is 2.13 okay so now you can send a message directly to brad using that address however just like in the activity ip addresses are not forever if i come around and tap you on the shoulder i need you to disconnect from your router and then connect back to it so i uh i noticed that she left and came back so when i tried to send a message she didn't respond and i wouldn't ask the dns again and the dns came back and she had a different address that she had before okay great aside from getting to experience a basic dns request and response this activity is meaningful because it will be the first time that students actually have to follow a protocol precisely this is because there is actually a computer responding to the requests that only understand certain commands
