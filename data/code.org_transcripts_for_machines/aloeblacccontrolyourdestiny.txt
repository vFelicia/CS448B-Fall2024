any machine that you're using has code that was developed by human beings if you can figure out how to be one of those human beings then you're that much further in life you're in control of your your communication your control of your destiny my name is aloe black i'm a singer and songwriter and entertainer i grew up in southern california i started making music back when i was about nine years old went writing lyrics as a hiphop artist and over the years got more involved in creating music my first experience with technology was when i was very young about six years old my dad purchased the family computer it was a commodore 64. and he would also bring home magazines called egghead magazines and they had code in them and he would encourage my sister and i to code as independent artists we realized if you're in control of all of the music all of the content and developing all of the pieces that go along with it no one can manipulate it so we took it took charge of creating all the songs mixing mastering recording and when it came to the internet that was really more my forte i quickly developed the skill to you know build a website and get online and use my knowledge of coding to make it so that people could learn more about our music the internet and technology has changed what we do in our lives and what's possible in dramatic ways i think this is something that you can get into and once you have access to the knowledge then that knowledge gives you power
