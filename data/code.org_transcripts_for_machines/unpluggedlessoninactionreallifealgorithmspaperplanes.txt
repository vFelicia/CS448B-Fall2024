okay so um one of the vocabulary words that we learned last time was algorithm will you guys say that with me again and what does it mean who remembers from so long ago andy what does algorithm mean a list of steps that you can follow to finish the task okay the list of steps right i bet that you follow algorithms every single day and you don't even realize it is there an algorithm in this classroom that anyone sees a list of steps that you follow to get something done jack schedule the schedule right that's a list of things that you need to do all together at a certain time for this example is there anything else what do you think anya oh i wrote a step a list of steps for math that's an algorithm that you follow to get something done right i didn't i didn't i didn't even know that it's so awesome okay so i want you to think of a specific situation where you have to follow a list of steps to get something done so i'll plant the seed in your brain think about what does it take for you to get to school in the morning there's a whole series of events that happens right so if you were explaining your life to someone that didn't know you and you said well in the morning i go to school the person that didn't know you might be like well do you live at school do you eat at school do you take a shower or a bath and then get dressed at school or is school at your house like you you just go to school that's it aren't there a whole lot of steps in between yeah so who can start me off with a list let's do this together as a class let's make a list of steps we have to do to get to school in the morning arjun will you start us what's going to be step number one well maybe wake up and get out of bed okay let's title this getting to school getting out of bed okay so number one's gonna say get out of bed do you guys all agree with that you have to go from your horizontal position to vertical to get out of bed okay what's next ariane what's next and we can gen relax go to the bathroom a lot of people do that go to the bathroom or take a shower okay so there's our algorithm there's our list for getting from the morning time to getting to school there's all these steps did you realize that you were doing 11 steps before you got to school anyway some of you did yeah and if you break it down even further there's a million steps right so sometimes it's nice to generalize like with getting your supplies you don't have to list every single supply you understand that that's general term for what you're doing okay so what i want us to practice today is thinking about more steps and specifically i want you to think about the steps that you need to follow to make paper airplanes paper airplanes the steps that you need to make paper airplanes some of you are saying but i don't know how to make paper airplanes well that's perfect because we're going to learn how to make paper airplanes so i have a couple of things to hand out to you and in the first sheet you are deciding you're deciding the steps that you follow to make a paper airplane so you're gluing the six correct steps how many choices are there does anyone know can you do quick math how many choices are there on the paper scion nine there's nine choices and there's six correct steps so will there be x will there be leftovers yes okay so six steps right that's one one part and what are we doing with those steps are we putting them health or skelter we're putting them in order okay so in order and then what's next trade okay so we'll trade after that trade your finished algorithm with another person or group and let them use it to make an actual flying paper airplane dramatic gasp paper airplanes okay so you'll trade it and then your partner will make an actual airplane i would love to make an airplane okay so does this help you to review our steps right these are the important bits if this was model drawing math this would be our important important bits yeah so let's do this so for this activity it takes a long time for the kids to cut out the steps themselves so if you want to do this quicker it'd be worth cutting out the steps and giving each kid an envelope with the steps cut out that takes that difficulty out of it and you can get through the lesson a little quicker something else you could use instead of folding paper airplanes for this activity is planting a seed following steps to plant a seed or anything origami that is folding paper is easy to get if you could add anything to the list of instructions that we had what would you have added arjun what do you think i would add decorate because i mean might look better with this stuff okay so we could add decorate on that'd be a good one to add i can write that in a different color these are things that we could add to this to this list decorate what else would you add or change i heard some kids saying that it was difficult to make the paper airplane out of the same paper that had the instructions on it yeah would you change that would in your instructions would you say get another piece of paper to make the paper airplane yeah it is wasting trees you'd have to decide what's important so could i write get another piece of paper question mark yes okay okay those are some great ideas
