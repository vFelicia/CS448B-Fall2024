You're about to get the chance to play with a new type of puzzle, called the collector. These puzzles are a lot like ones you've already seen except for a few important changes. In each puzzle, the collector will look for items to grab. When she gets to them, she won't be able to simply run over the items to pick them up. Instead you will need to use the collect block to grab each pile. Be careful! The number of items that need to be collected to pass a level will change. Sometimes you only need to collect one pile, and other puzzles, plan to collect everything. Make sure you pay attention to the instructions to find out what the rules are before you start!
