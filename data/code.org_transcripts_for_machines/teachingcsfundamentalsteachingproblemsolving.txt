one important thing you can do to help your students succeed with the cs fundamentals course is to encourage them to develop their own problem solving process a metacognitive approach to tackling complex problems is something your students can rely on again and again as their computer science studies become more difficult at code.org we like to teach a fourstep problemsolving process which we call the puzzle solving recipe step one understand the problem when introducing a puzzle on code studio or a challenge in an unplugged lesson help your students deeply understand the problem before they begin to solve it this can be done by asking students to restate the problem in their own words or make connections to problems that they've solved in the past step two make a plan before your students attempt a solution have them create a strategy for how they will get there what steps will they need to take and in what order step 3 perform and perfect the plan now have your students put their plan into action while they're working through their strategy and encountering obstacles remind them to revisit their initial understanding of the problem let them know that it's okay to make changes to the plan as needed and don't let them give up persistence is the key to being a successful computer scientist step four check your work once they've solved the problem have your students go back and check their work then talk through the problemsolving experience with the class what did they learn about computer science from this specific problem and what did they learn about problem solving in general scaffolding cs fundamentals puzzles and lessons in this way helps your students experience success with the challenging content additionally these problem solving strategies are not just relevant to computer science problem solving is a skill that can be used to tackle challenges in any aspect of your students lives how do you scaffold problem solving in your classroom tell us on twitter at teach code
