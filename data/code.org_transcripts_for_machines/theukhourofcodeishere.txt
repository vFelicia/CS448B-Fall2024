here we are 2012 we all depend on technology and none of us know how to read and write code it's not this kind of geeky techy thing what you're doing is empowering yourself it's like a puzzle and if you like Puzzles and challenges you're going to love coding it's absolutely indispensable to so many of the things we're trying to do today whether you want to be the Prime Minister a vet or a social worker technology is going to underpin all of those jobs The Internet Is Now everywhere it's like water it's Transforming Our World in 20 years shapes are countries shapes are kind of social dynamics uh can innovate so much and so if you have that toolkit it means you have a lot of power to kind of come up with crazy ideas and make them real I got my first computer when I was in sixth grade I had a a zx81 personal computer I coded because I didn't just want to use the program I wanted to start writing them that's why I wrote a program to play tic tac toe you start small building something that you're interested in and you just learn these lessons and there aren't that many of them and you you just eventually can get to the point where you can do almost anything that you want you're able to launch something you know create it and deliver it across the world in in in no time at all it just unlocks all these all these different possibilities if you can code you can take the ideas in your head and make them happen so you can not just play Angry birds you can actually make your own Angry Birds or you can make visual effects in a film or you can design a jet propulsion engine it's all about possibilities and if you want to change the world technology is the best way great coders are to these we that's it
