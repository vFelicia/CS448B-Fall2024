good morning and welcome to the santa fe indian school can everybody please rise for our invocation given by frank loma santa fe indian school student from santa clara pueblo hopi and tewa um um know is you may be seated welcome students and teachers any of our pueblo governors and tribal leaders welcome all guests to the santa fe indian school and happy computer science education week about two years ago our sfis teacher kate salah invited me to a code.org teacher training where they had a oneday training for administrators this training allowed me to see that there are many opportunities to bring computer science to our school since then she has offered a four credit and dual credit computer science course last year two of her students from her class elias trancosa and terrell toledo won the congressional app challenge if you did not know santa fe indian school has been a leader of computer science education dating back to 1985 when we introduced our first computer programming course so it is fitting that we are the first high school to host this special event but students coding is not just a course you take in school or in college it is a way of creative thinking and problem solving so that you may find ways to improve our communities and maintain our languages and cultures so we are very excited to take to kick off computer science education week alexis um alexis will be joining us and she is alexis harrington harrigan excuse me up um she is the director of state government affairs at code.org she'll be emceeing today's show event thank you so much good morning how's everybody doing great thank you so much principal rosetta thank you to the santa fe indian school i want to send a special thanks to the pueblo governors of new mexico who are here with us today and all of the staff for coming out and giving us such a warm welcome to everybody who's partnered with us for this event thank you i would also like to give a special thanks to our extended community tuning in via live stream all over the united states every year we've done something very special for the computer science education kickoff week from opening the new york stock exchange being hosted at the white house by president barack obama and working with some incredible female leaders in tech in silicon valley so we were especially honored for the 10th anniversary of computer science education week to be able to be with you all here today at the santa fe indian school as principal rosetta mentioned earlier there's been a legacy of computer science dating back many many years here in santa fe so this year it's 10 years i think this deserves some collapse so congratulations for 10 years of computer science education week so in addition to being joined in addition to being joined by the santa fe indian school students we have other students from across new mexico here with us today and at code.org some of us have a very competitive spirit so i hope that you can join me we want to hear from each of the schools here today so when i when i say your school name and where you're from i would love the students teachers faculty that are here to stand up and give us a round of applause let us hear from you and let the folks online hear from you as well so we want to hear from cobre high school from jefferson montessori are you here in the house today thank you so much can we hear it from uh oh i'm sorry jefferson academy in carlsbad new mexico can you stand please hey great that's you okay sorry uh next six directions indigenous school from gallup all right you guys are being very quiet i want to hear from you like let's let's hear some whoops let's hear let's hear it there you go okay asekiah school from from madre elementary are you guys in the house let's hear it great and i know the santa fe indian school students are going to have an unfair advantage but i want to hear from you all let's hear the have live stream folks hear from you so please give yourself a round of applause thank you we're excited to hear from olive there you go we're excited to hear from all of you especially our students because computer science is our future and you are our future so we're kicking off uh in new mexico but computer science education week is happening everywhere just watch the video king william virginia philadelphia pennsylvania change the world so from santa fe to all parts of the world happy computer science education week everyone in this room and everyone watching live stream on the count of three i want you to join the students up here and say learn computer science change the world okay on the count of three learn computer science change the world as loud as you can one two three learn computer science change the world awesome thank you so much now i would like to introduce the csta president jake baskin to the stage so before jake was he jake was the president of csta he actually had my job at code.org so i took his job and now he's off doing wonderful things so thank you so much jake for being here thanks alexis wow so yeah thank you so much alexis it's it's really wonderful to be up here and thank you so much to sfis for hosting us and to everyone who traveled to be here today i also want to say a special thank you to many of the partners that helped make csta possible uh microsoft google and acm are key supporters and of course the csta members from around the world and most importantly i want to say a special thank you to all of the teachers here in the room and that are watching on the live stream you know it's pretty easy for me to get to travel around stand up here and talk about how great cs edweek is but the event only exists because of teachers all over that bring computer science into their classrooms because it's what their students are interested in and deserve and so i'd love it if every teacher in the room would stand up and let's give them a huge round of applause truly thank you teachers are doing the most important work so today we're here to celebrate the 10th anniversary of cs that week which was founded in 2009 it's a pretty incredible milestone and i i couldn't believe that i'd be standing up here when the first csi week was happening csi week was founded by a really incredible group of organizations and partners that knew cs education was important and wanted to make sure more students could learn computer science i want to give a special shout out to two folks that really helped lead the way chris stevenson who is the founding executive director of the computer science teachers association and cameron wilson who has done with acm and they focused on making sure that they could raise awareness among policymakers for cs education even getting congress to pass a resolution recognizing the first week and then someone figured out that policy is great and all but it's teachers who actually make things happen so in 2010 chaired by deborah richardson the focus of csi week shifted and focused on bringing computer science into more classrooms and to support more students and this continued into 2011 with uh 2011 and 2012 with ruth farmer taking over to share the event in fact i still have the first email i got from my local csta chapter announcing that csi week was happening in 2010. we celebrated in my classroom in chicago and i tried to get the city of chicago to recognize the week i wasn't very successful but they've caught on since then then in 2013 some guy made this video and responsibility for organizing css week was transition to code.org along with the launch of the hour of code has anyone in this room done an hour of code at least a few people hopefully everyone by the end of today which brings us here to today where i'm excited to share that starting with today's cohosted event csta is going to be taking increasing ownership in csi week moving forward ensuring that it continues to be a communitycentered and focused event that supports teachers across the country and around the world but that's not all i'm also thrilled that today csta gets to release our new standards for cs teachers these are standards that are designed to provide guidance around what effective equitable and rigorous cs instruction should look like excuse me and provide clarity around what cs teachers should know and be able to do in the computer science classroom i encourage you to check out these standards at csteachers.org teacher standards and i want to give a huge thank you to the incredible team of writers that spent this last year developing and debating to make these incredible guidance for teachers moving forward along with iste who partnered with us on this work so i just want to say one last time thanks to everyone everyone tuning in and everyone here in this room let's have one incredible css week thank you so much jake so as i mentioned earlier i took jake's job at code.org i want to introduce the person next on the stage who knows maybe i'll be taking his job next our founder and ceo code.org please give a round of applause to hottie partoby thank you i'm so excited to be here and i want to say again thank you to the uh sfis for hosting us here and for all the partners who are here together with us this has been such an amazing run for me since 2013 in the launch of code.org and the launch of the very first hour of code campaign i want to start by thanking all the donors who have funded computer science education over the years especially microsoft amazon facebook and infosys as well as thank you to the cs education week advisory committee that every year helps us put on a wonderful event so we launched the hour of code six years ago back then code.org was just about five people it was a tiny little organization and we had this idea that in every school in the entire country or even in the world teachers can take just one hour out of their schedule to teach computer science to students to basically to take the veil of sort of secrecy and uh you know darkness away from this new field that is changing the world around us in the six years since the hour of code launched we've had 835 million hours of code done by students in every city and in every country on the planet it's been an incredible success the hour of code has become by far the largest movement in the history of world education but one hour is not enough we don't do just one hour of math or just one hour of english we teach these subjects year round and and throughout a student's education lifetime and so the hour of code really started a movement to teach computer science in schools and since 2013 another thing that's happened is in the united states we've had all 50 states including dc have changed policies in the last six years to take steps to make computer science part of the core curriculum part of the academic school day to make it an actual academic field recognized in the school system alongside subjects like math and english and science and history every single state including here in new mexico has taken steps to make computer science part of the academic school day so this has been an incredible success thank you all and computer science is not just a united states topic this is a global movement globally over 50 countries have taken steps to incorporate computer science in schools these are countries you might expect like south korea and japan or countries you might not expect like saudi arabia or argentina on every continent countries are basically taking steps to make computer science accessible to every student to increase diversity in the field to make sure everybody has access to opportunity and speaking of diversity one stat i'm especially proud of for the first time last year for the hour of code an equal number of boys and girls participated in the hour of code this is a historically computer science has been a field that has been dominated by men it's been roughly 80 men 20 women but with the students that are doing the hour of code and also learning computer science as a followon course in schools we can completely flip that and get to a 5050 gender balance and last year we did it with the hour of code and each year we're going to continue doing this now one hour of code is a great start but it's really just the first step towards a complete computer science pathway and computer science is today still not offered as a real course in the vast majority of schools but that's changing globally because teachers have led the way teachers as jake said are doing the most important job in the world and i want to have everybody again join in giving them a round of applause for the work they're doing in classrooms so our theme for this year's hour of code and computer science education week is about computer science for good computer science can be used in so many ways to make the world a better place we can use computer science and software and technology to detect diseases sooner and even one day cure them our future cars and trucks will be safer and more energy efficient we can develop cleaner and more sustainable energy sources we can offer our children more equitable and universally accessible education and there's really no limit to what we could do with computer science but our imaginations you can also make really cool snapchat filters computer science is this generation's super power and with great power comes great responsibility and therefore it's our responsibility as educators to not only teach the superpower in our schools but also to inspire students to use computer science for good which is why we chose the theme of cs for good for the hour of code and i expect this theme will stick around well beyond this year we have a short video to play to introduce the theme for this year the world has some big problems but i'm little what can i do even when problems seem big we can tackle them one step at a time our generation can help make a more prosperous equitable and sustainable world i'm learning to code i'm designing apps that solve local problems i'm programming robots i'm learning computer science to make change happen because with technology we can build robots to clean the world's oceans we can program drones to detect forest fires quickly we can empower young women with digital skills and tools we can program mobile apps to streamline farming in poor rural areas we can use gene sequencing to diagnose diseases and create personalized medicine to cure them i'm little but don't look at my size look at my potential i can make change happen i can make change happen i can make change happen i can make change happen thank you everybody thank you hottie what a great video every year for hour of code it seems like we outdo ourselves and this year is no exception there are a lot of misconceptions out there about what computer science is that it's a niche just for the technology field that it just belongs in silicon valley but that's just not true and our panel that i'm introducing today i am so proud embodies so much of what the cs for good theme is all about whether it's the work that they're doing in their career professions inventions that they're making every day the apps that they're using or their creativity i'm honored to welcome to the stage some amazing people who will be joining us up here so please join me in giving each of those these folks a round of applause first i'd like to welcome to the stage shayna white csta teacher and csta equity fellow from gwinnett county georgia next i'd like to welcome to the stage emma yang student and creator of the timeless app a first of its kind mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to help those diagnosed with alzheimer's and dementia remember events stay connected and engaged with friends family and recognize loved ones from new york city thank you emma next i'd like to welcome to the stage jordan skypal strategic operations manager at pinterest and strong advocate for native americans in the tech industry she lives in the bay area and she's also enrolled in the colorado indian river river tribes next thank you thank you for joining us jordan next i'd like to introduce tara jose excuse me founder and ceo of technovation a global tech education nonprofit that empowers girls and families to become leaders creators and problem solvers who also lives in the bay area thanks for joining us and finally somebody who might have the coolest nickname uh mr drew dr wuhu trujillo who is the director of technology of meow wolf a local arts collective here in santa fe and local to santa fe thank you so much for being here um so i'd like for all of our panelists first to just kind of introduce themselves and maybe share something you're passionate about so we can connect with the audience hi my name is emma yang i'm a junior from high school in new york city and also the founder of timeless timeless is an app that i created that uses artificial intelligencebased facial recognition technology to help to empower alzheimer's patients to stay connected with their friends and family i was inspired to create this app for my experience with my grandmother and i'm really passionate about using my passion for coding to help and benefit as many people around the world as possible good morning my name is jordan i'm lakota and nes purse on my mom's side and hopi in mojave on my dad's side i live in san francisco i work at pinterest previously worked at facebook we'll talk a little bit more about that what i'm really passionate about though is that representation matters that it's important that our native communities are represented within the tech sector and that we continue to try to draw a connection between our communities and our homelands and everything that's happening in the tech world so i hope to continue to talk about that a little bit more today good morning everyone i'm really thrilled to be here my name is tara and i run a technology entrepreneurship program called technovation which is to empower young people to find problems that they find in their communities and to actually create technology to solve those problems some things that i'm passionate about i like to build rockets and i like to paint and so sometimes i paint rockets and then i shoot them good morning i'm drew i'm i work at meow wolf i'm very passionate about looking not only creating things with my hands but also creating tools via programming that enabled me to create something that i wouldn't be able to otherwise because those tools don't exist there's a lot of opportunities for that i'm also very passionate about outreach and helping students understand how they can stay and live within this beautiful state that we live in and pursue careers within computer science for the for the good of everybody thank you so i'd like to start our first question it's going to be for emma and jordan um what got you into computer science what was kind of the hook to get you into computer science yeah so i was introduced to computer science when i was six years old i started kind of coding with scratch was a tool kind of a block by block programming tool to help kids learn how to code um and so i started with that and i progressed kind of to making little websites and games but then actually it was not until i was doing 10 years old that particularly in technovation with a classmate of mine and i create an app that uses a mobile app to help to detect concussions easier and so that was kind of my bridge into realizing that you know my passion for coding was something i thought was really fun and kind of a hobby that i like to do was actually something that could empower me as a middle school student i could affect change in the world and i could really benefit people that even i'd never met but i could still create something to help them i originally started in actually nonprofit when i graduated from arizona state i moved back to the bay area and the first thing that i did was go to my relatives and say who can help me get a job and the first opportunities that came up were in nonprofit so i worked for the native american health center in oakland for quite a while until my mom actually who is from standing rock uh said and was working at facebook at the time said you know there's a lot of opportunities in the tech world that you should explore and you should come over and you should look at some of these roles and you should interview for them and see what happens and so really the bridge for me was her just as an introduction that she even said this is possible you know you should you should look into this you should think about this and so i did i interviewed took a long time it's hard it's competitive and it's challenging but i made a move from nonprofit into tech i worked at facebook for a little while and now i'm at pinterest so my journey is a little bit unconventional but it started from working from the community and now it leads me into tech awesome i love unconventional journeys especially as a teacher hearing from middle schoolers kids that i'm empowering in my classes today could be the next inventor of these apps that could do so much good for me people in the world so tara my next question for you is what are some of the problems that computer science can help us solve yeah so technovation has been running for 14 years in 100 countries and we see incredible technology solutions that don't normally come out of silicon valley or typical the tech companies because the inventors are people like you they are young people and young people have a very unique perspective so some of my favorite apps and there are so many was a team from bolivia this was a very remote team that lived in the mountains and they learned about this the technovation competition from amazing teacher and um they were very confused because they're like why would we want to create an app and put it on the market and charge uh um for for it and the mentor was a little surprised and then they realized like this town or this area was so remote that they don't use money they actually barter but they all had smartphones and so the girls thought a lot about what could be some problems that technology could help them with and they realized that they spent most of their time walking because this top place was very remote and so they created an app where you could scan a qr code how many of you know what a qr code is so that white and black image so they printed it on paper and then they put these printouts on rocks all over the village for like 10 miles and so you could scan this qr code and while you were walking you could learn how to code you could learn math because they felt that that was very important and they could learn the language that was their native language that was dying out and that app was so powerful because i felt that a typical engineer from silicon valley would never create an app like that and it um it is a representation of a voice that is small but a voice that is very powerful and that's what technology can do it can amplify one person's voice awesome drew would you like to share even also not only problems that can solve but how does cs look here in santa fe sure um in relation the problems that cs can solve one of the one of the most fascinating questions that i remember when i worked at autodesk was this question about how can design and programming for us basically uh help improve the world where there's 7.5 billion people and so in every project that we work on we always think about that question and so in relation to computer science and 3d printing there's so much room for improvement within 3d printing and additive manufacturing so that the the themes that we actually create are more sustainable for the environment and with a real focus on uh climate change and so within santa fe itself uh at least through meow wolf we we participate in a lot of different steam and stem different types of workshops locally in terms of the schools i think there's a lot of opportunities for during the summer time for you to look at like the community college in terms of taking courses for uh for computer science um and so yeah i think that's awesome good stuff um so my next question is going to be for jordan to piggyback off of your facebook comment um we always hear with great power comes great responsibility and we know with computer science it unlocks so many powerful things that we can do for the world and to change the world but there's an ethics piece to that and so i'm curious what you think creators should be aware of when they're building this new technology and they're creating this new technology for people to use um so does everybody remember when the standing rock protest was happening a few years ago um so at facebook um they have a policy um that requires you to use your real name so that people don't go on and use pseudo names like you could on myspace or like other platforms you know where you can have a username but when standing rock was happening there were a lot of people posting videos and live streaming right that they were protesting they were there and we were occupying and unfortunately because the politics were so strong you know during around what's happening there in the keystone pipeline there were a lot of other people on facebook who were trying to block those people from being able to live stream so they were reporting them for having an inauthentic name um and so on the facebook side what was happening was these accounts were being flagged as being inauthentic and the team who was responsible for going through every single name and making sure that it was real didn't actually realize that there are a lot of native names out there in the world that sound very different than what we traditionally hear in western in western society right so you know you know elk eagle and bear walks and you know all our relatives that have names that are different or if you're from the southwest and you have you know different sounding names that people are not used to hearing they weren't able to actually decide or identify whether or not those names were real because they didn't have that experience with native people so it was flagged internally some of us that worked there my mom included got involved with the team that was responsible for managing that and we worked with them to bring in somebody from the community who could help educate them on some cultural competency to say here's some examples of the kinds of native names that you may come across here also is a suggestion to add a tribal id as a form of identification that people can use to validate themselves if their account gets reported so now on facebook you can use your tribal id to to validate yourself the point being that what we did was we educated people internally we helped solve this problem a lot faster and the only way we would have been able to do that is if we had representation inside of facebook we were able to actually solve that problem so continuing my message that it's important that we're well represented and remember that wherever you work you come from the community that you come from and you can help solve problems that other people might not otherwise be able to that's awesome tara i'd love for you and drew to also kind of ask the ethics piece especially because you guys are dealing with tech innovations with um your mouth like how you're kind of getting the ethics um taken care of as far as people understanding wanting to build these things but understanding that power they need to be responsible with it yeah i think in our in our curriculum in the program we start with find a problem that you face and right away that prompt makes it a personal problem and sometimes um people don't mean harm right like you you create a prototype you create a solution and then because it's for the world you launch it into the world and it's an interesting exercise to see well what were the unintended consequences of what you just did so for instance um and we as organizers and an education nonprofit are also learning what types of tools should we provide to students so you're thinking about it not after the damage is done but a little bit before and sometimes these things can be very very hard because technology innovation means that it did not exist before so it's hard to kind of predict what's going to happen so one example was one team earlier this year created an image recognition system to help children with autism and and it was autism and down syndrome and um and right away it would it would look at people's faces and try to distinguish whether a person needed help or a child needed help or not and from the team's perspective it was meant to help but right away from if you were to hear about it you're like that doesn't sound right um and so there are many instances like that when you're trying to create so technology can be very powerful because immediately when you put it online thousands of people can use it a lot of data can be generated you have to think through a little bit about what are the good and bad things that could happen uh that you did not intend and so the best way to do that is to actually bring together a group of people from different who are not like you and to get their perspective even before you launch it because you will learn so much from that and it's simple it's really just you have some humility and you're just wanting to hear from people so that's a it's a it's an interesting and a fun way and will make your product so much better one of one of the fascinating things about um technology just in general is this attraction to innovate just for the sake of technology and just for the sake of innovation and that could be a trap if you're not thinking about just to re uh iterate what tara was talking about what kind of solutions are you trying to solve what's the good what is the bad in relation that and so for example when i was at autodesk we were doing a lot of research in relation to robotics and so i would hack into robots and try to find the sweet spot between what a person brings to the table and what a robot does the the the challenge within that scenario was does a robot replace a human and a job basically so that was an interesting thing to consider the other in relation to meow wolf and what i do on a very regular basis technology can we use it for lighting we use it for sound uh engineering tech fabrication we use it basically to enhance the story and enhance the emotions and so the most important question there really is what is the story that we're trying to tell what are we really trying to have people think about and question in relation to daytoday uh their daytoday lives and so it's not technology for the sake of technology but it's really there as a means to help you you know explore the world and try to find better answers than what we presented in the past i think that's a big um thing to think about is the good and bad and i even want to kind of ask emma with you developing your own app dealing with facial recognition and we understand the ethics behind facial recognition sometimes there's some boundaries that can be crossed what did you consider when you were developing your app as far as the ethics piece yeah so there's definitely a lot of you know data privacy concerns that we um that i as a developer and also you know the ui ux designers i work with we do consider a lot interesting how do we store people's data what kind of data do we collect actually in the latest release that we just had we actually released a kind of a more global release this weekend we did a soft launch in may and so we're kind of expanding out um we did take a look at you know when we have users register um do you want to take the patient's address because you know originally we think well with my own grandmother we write down her address for her in case that she doesn't remember and she can't find her way back home um and so we wanted to take into consideration and ask people out out there who would potentially use the app you know would you like us to take your address is that something that you'd be comfortable sharing with us and so thinking about those kinds of considerations and taking into account other people's privacy concerns and their level of you know their level of comfort with sharing their data especially because i'm working with an older generation that isn't as used to technology has been something that's been kind of interesting throughout my journey creating timeless so my next question to kind of summate as far as cs for good is what are you doing right now that is cs for good um before we kind of give a charge to the audience and the students because we want them to engage in cs for good what are you doing right now currently with cs for good i think my focus really is on empowering the populations that you know traditional tech industry might not have looked at um i think you know a lot of the time when we think of you know the older generation especially alzheimer's patients we think you know they can't use technology it's not really their world but i think that the meaning of technology and innovation is really accessibility and empowerment and bringing you know these benefits to not only the people who we see using them on a daytoday basis but also those who could benefit from them but aren't getting those benefits right now um and so that's why i've really been pushing for not only you know creating timeless and developing timeless but also in general pushing for people to take into consideration those around them who maybe aren't being touched by technology and really could benefit from it especially because you know right now people aren't designing for the older population and so what i really think about a lot is how do we design this so it's really easy to use and it's understandable to a different kind of population and so i think that's something that is really meaningful to me because you know my grandmother herself we are using technology with her but that's not something that's very visible outside in our culture and so pushing for that has been really important to me um yeah i mentioned that you know my mission in life is just to represent us as native people in tech and try to create some connections between our communities and what's happening in in the tech world i think two things are really top of mind for me right now one is i love participating in events like this just to come out and speak to other folks and say hey there's other native people in silicon valley or in other parts of the tech world so if you're interested you know there are there's a community of us out in other parts of of the country and so i love doing this kind of work and just talking about what we're doing the other is that you know i work at pinterest so right now my mission is to help us as indigenous people who work at pinterest we have a small community look at the platform itself and say how can we make this better how can we make our content that people might want to try to find on pinterest relevant and current so that it's not stereotyping us so that it doesn't look as something that is old or you know dated and so right now we're focused on trying to look at all of the pins and the content that's on pinterest and look at what people might actually be searching for and say how do we make this up to date how do we represent us as who we are today so that's what i'm focused on right now so i have a question for you how many of you have a smartphone how many of you think you can make an app for that phone you know so so if you go to technovation.org there's a full curriculum where you can just go step by step by step and you need to know nothing about coding but at the end of three months you'll actually have created an app that you can use your friends can use your family can use the world can use and you can think about what are some things that have been frustrating you and think a little bit about how can technology help ease that frustration and then you actually have an idea and that idea is completely you it's unique it's your voice and you should bring that voice to the world right now i'm at having grown up and and lived in new mexico for a large chunk of my life one of the things that's most important to me is being able to uh provide opportunity for students like yourselves and and build that bridge from not only kindergarten all the way through twelfth grade but into different vocational technical schools universities and then into companies like meow wolf and so not only myself but a large number of my coworkers are participate on a very regular basis in terms of different steam types of events we follow jennifer novaris on a very regular basis to help out in communities like zuni in terms of workshops for how to program with arduino and raspberry pi etc and so for me the good part of that is really trying to help educate students like yourself so that you have the opportunity like i mentioned before to be able to stay here within new mexico if you want to not have to move away from this beautiful state all right our last uh question is kind of a charge for our audience here and also our live stream audience is how would you encourage students to use cs for good i think you know in order to encourage students to use cs for good from a teacher side also people working in the industry to really embrace the change that students want to see and for students themselves to really push for that change because i think that you know myself when i was a middle school student i was you know 12 or 13 years old i just started emailing you know these ctos who you know worked for these facial recognition companies and asking you know would you like to be my mentor for this project i'd like to do and i think that the most meaningful mentors were the ones that i found who really believed in my vision and really also were passionate about it and also treated me as an equal and saw that the change that i wanted to create was something that was viable and that's something that if we all kind of put in the resources and he could you know guide me through the process with something that was tangible and really meaningful and beneficial and so i think that for you know the adults also to kind of really embrace this change and also you know take kids seriously and listen to what they want to see happen in the world and to help to make that happen i would say you know think about a problem that you care a lot about if it's you know the environment if it's politics if it's social media or connections or your community or people or health care whatever it is that's important to you it's unique to you think about how you can connect the technology world with that because there are so many problems yet to be solved and all of us have the ability to help solve them but what will really drive and fuel that is how much you care about it and so the more that you actually genuinely feel like you want to be a part of that change and maybe one day look back and say the legacy that i left behind is that i worked on this i was a part of that project or i met all of these incredible people who also worked on amazing projects that i helped support or that i knew or that i was championing from the sideline so think about what you care about and also support those around you who are also doing really great things so i would say that believe that age is no barrier if you're eight years old nine years old or ten years old if technology like harley said is a superpower so it enables you to make a change in the world that you live in so don't wait until you're a grownup or an adult or you have a job or there's absolutely nothing stopping you you can go online you can teach yourself how to build things but it really the power lies in you and you have to sort of wake up and say i don't need to complain i can actually fix this problem and begin to take steps towards that bring your friends bring two or three friends work in a team and it'll be the most powerful experience of your life so don't wait i love all that that's all super important and when i was your age computer programming basically meant we had these punch cards and i don't know if you've ever seen these punch cards but i would do something like two plus two i would program that on the punch card i would mail that out you would wait two weeks to be able to find out that it was four and there was one computer mysteriously somewhere and it was the size of a room right now you are so lucky in that you have uh access to be able to go to websites like code.org or you have tools like littlebits or you can program within scratch and if you don't have those the little bits go to your librarian ask for it if you don't have access to scratch or any computer science programs within your schools go to your teachers and ask for it because your demand and the demand for that they'll listen to that hopefully and we'll be able to uh make that much more accessible to you but in general you have so many different tools that are available for you to at least build that foundation to begin with and then the next steps after that are what kind of good can you can you use that new uh skill set for i'd like to thank our panelists um for sharing your brilliance and your wisdom with our live studio audits can we get a round of applause for our panels wow i feel like quite the underachiever after that panel one more round of applause for our panelists thank you so much now we're going to transition to our next segment our cs award panel so i'd like to invite hottie and jake back up to the stage please and shayna thank you would you please stay on stage as well and next page prescott who is our amazing computer science champion advocate teacher extraordinaire in the state of new mexico thank you so much thank you uh and probably one of the neatest parts of today i'd like to invite up our student high five tunnel to come up and get set up for for our awards today so as they're doing that the purpose of the champions for cs award is to celebrate students teachers administrators and organizations who have made significant impact to improve access to and the equity of computer science education this year we received more than 200 nominations from all over the united states we're inspired by the work of these winners we're celebrating not just them but the work of thousands upon thousands of computer science champions just like them all over the world before we hand out the awards i'd also like to take a moment and thank the committee the awards committee and especially dan bleyer a cfta school district representative from plano texas independent school district and vicki sedgwick a csta k.a representative from los angeles for all the hard work they put in to selecting these award winners and making today possible so give them a round of applause all right students is our high five tunnel ready i don't believe you are we sure all right well before i turn it over to shayna i'm going to test that five tunnel out so shayna thank you so much let's try it out thanks all right this year this year's champion cs organization award is presented to the mission economic development corporation accepting this award is mission director of social impact christina garza christina has worked to prioritize computer science and stem education for the entire city of mission texas she's arranged a partnership for mouse to train 100 teachers and 20 counselors in cs and she's prioritized opportunities for young women and nonbinary students by creating the crew internship program which includes summer coding camps and ongoing mentorship and business and professional skills congratulations to mission edc and christina paul foster is our champion of cs administrator a winner paul is the chief administ information and accountability officer at springfield public schools in massachusetts most of the students in paul's district have not traditionally had access to computer science education so to bridge the gap paul partnered with the university of massachusetts amherst to create computer science curriculum for all 33 of the district's elementary schools paul couldn't be with her be with us here today but he's watching online congratulations paul la janae walker is this year's champion of cs teacher award winner lajanet teaches computer science at the city college academy of the arts and over just two years login a has a full computer science department at the city college academy of arts the only department in the school that offers two ap courses her students went from receiving no computer science instruction to having coursework in coding languages access to a robotics team and a girls who code chapter more than 100 students have enrolled in her computer science classes and half of them are enrolled in an ap course the majority of logins ap students pass their apcs principals exam and a third has since moved on to apcsa congratulations and next is rachel robinson she is accepting the ap diversity award on behalf of her school audrey kell high school in charlotte north carolina rachel's school had the highest number of female students who took the ap computer science principles test out of schools using the code.org curriculum in 20172018 out of 344 test takers 117 of them were young women this is an amazing achievement and we're excited to honor the incredible work of rachel and her school's computer science program and next is axel toro he is our champions of cs student winner axel is a senior at dr carlos gonzalez high school in aguada puerto rico and he's our winner because he created a pair of smart glasses to help people with visual impairments navigate the world the glasses use sound waves to measure the distance between the wearer and potential obstacles and they also use artificial intelligence and a camera to identify objects for the wearer the entire device runs on a raspberry pi zero which is half the size of a credit card congratulations axel congratulations again to all of our award winners can we give them one more round of applause please thank you so before we wrap up today's events i would like to welcome to the stage one more very special guest howie morales was elected lieutenant governor of new mexico in november 2018 along with governor michelle lujan grisham prior to becoming the state's 30th lieutenant governor he served in the new mexico senate for 11 years on the legislative finance committee the first in his family to attend college how he put himself through western new mexico university in silver city where he earned degrees in education he also earned a phd in education curriculum and instruction from new mexico state university as a classroom teacher for over a decade and a successful coach of high school basketball and baseball teams howie is an outspoken advocate for students educators and classrooms please join us in giving a warm round of applause to new mexico's own lieutenant governor howie morales wow good morning what a wonderful energy what a wonderful crowd i'm so excited to be part of this with you because this is the reason why i chose to get into public service how you can connect the public sector and the public service aspect of it with education so i'm so proud to be here with every one of you i want to congratulate all of our awardees thank you for coming to new mexico you know i'm very proud of this state i was born raised and educated right here in new mexico and i always say no matter where i travel across the country that new mexico is a land of enchantment the land of hot air balloons the land of hotter green chile but the coolest people that you're ever going to meet and i hope you've seen that those are to visit us before i begin i just want to just just acknowledge some individuals who are in the audience with us today you know education has been at the heart of what i do and today brings so many memories of my journey to get to the point where i am but i always want to make sure that we continue to advocate for our educators across the state of new mexico and across the country and across the world and when i talk about educators i'm not talking just about teachers i'm talking about educators teachers educational assistants bus drivers those that work in the cafeteria custodians counselors and the list can go on and on because if you have an impact on that child's life you're an educator and i ask today that all educators here in the auditorium please stand and be recognized thank you so much and i have to say when i drove up i was at the roundhouse this morning doing some work uh preparing for for the week and i drove up and the first bus that i saw was about a bus of cobre high school there's all my cobra indians right there i had the opportunity to work there for many years and to teach and to coach in that district and so it made me very proud and kind of brought those memories matter of fact our superintendent of the schools that we're in right here mr roy hidetta or mr roy are you still here i saw him a little while there you are thank you so much for all your efforts for education across the state on behalf of the governor michelle lujan grisham and myself we're so grateful that you are here with us today that you've made computer science education week a possibility and having new mexico be part of that and so we're grateful i'd like to personally thank all the folks at the computer science teachers association code.org where i got my cool pin today thank you so much heidi for that i want to thank the computer science alliance the santa fe indian school hottie jake alexis and paige thank you so much and i want to give a special thank you as well to a person who i'm so proud that agreed to join our team at the public education department dr gwen warden thank you so much just wanted to just say thank you for that so much is taking place when you talk about the movement for computer science and having that opportunity brought back those memories like i shared a while ago i can remember back in 1989 1990 being in that high school classroom where my computer science teacher mrs uh peggy back then we were on the apple two e's where we still had the floppy disks and we learned a little bit about using the computer and a little bit about coding a little bit about what that meant for communication and fast forwarding and i shared the story of covre high school i can remember when i would go to the library or go somewhere usually in a school setting to utilize a computer and to get to know that a little bit more i can remember when growing up we didn't have much money and my father was a minor my mother was a teacher assistant but i remember the day that my father bought me a computer he saved up money and tried to assist me along my journey as i began my doctorate work and i sat there with that computer and i went over and over and over and actually a logo that i created for the baseball program took many hours learning exploring the potential of communicating with that computer and so when i look and see the impact that that's had on my life it's personal to me and i share that with you because my father passed away less than two months ago but the gift that he was able to give me and to share has been so impactful that i went on to get my phd not only in curriculum instruction but in the powers and uses of learning technology and assisting special education students many of you have a same story and give a round of applause for those stories that have brought you where you're at today so as you know in new mexico there's a lot of momentum and we're excited about the pathway that we're taking in education because we understand that everything begins and ends with education and fortunately under the governor michelle lujan grisham administration under the direction of public education department what we've seen is that new mexico has established a computer science education task force made up of more than 40 individuals bringing people from all sectors together to ensure that we are going to provide recommendations to include a statewide strategic plan this is significant because we recognize the importance of computer science within our daily curriculum and i can tell you that many times there's a lot of myths that we hear in our society we laugh about those myths we don't think twice about them you remember some of those myths you better not cross your eyes why not they'll stay that way you better not eat that watermelon seed how come it'll stay in your stomach and then some of you and you didn't get home when you should have you know that lady that walks the river right there leorona she was going to come and get you we laugh about it we don't even think twice about some of those myths but there are some myths out there that could be harmful and i share these myths that could be harmful because we have to make sure that not only in our state are we addressing it but across the country and across the world one of those myths says that to be good enough is to be good enough or to be average is okay the reality in our society is that many times it's not that we aim too high and that we miss many times is that we aim too low when we hit and we stop growing stop challenging ourselves stop pursuing the things that can make us great and i think in the state of new mexico even though we've done some wonderful things in this last legislative session and years before that that we've seen some movement taking place we can still do more and i believe that we can do more and get to be great by ensuring that we have the support for all of our computer science educators across the state of new mexico that we can offer stipends that we can offer training that's so necessary to bring that expertise and to build on the expertise that we already have one of those other myths out there that could be harmful is when we hear the myth that we have to focus on reading and math because reading and math is what is measured reading and math is going to be on those standardized tests well i have to believe that not only does computer science need to be part of our daily schedules and our curriculum we have to recognize that it is a component an added component that is going to be instrumental in expanding our learning opportunities and capabilities you see for too long in our country we've been chasing the elusive student achievement scores when in reality we should all long be chasing student engagement computer science gives us that opportunity to have student engagement on areas of interest right there that'll increase the opportunities to continue to grow and to learn you see when i question as a high school student why do we have to take algebra why do we have to take chemistry why do we have to take these subjects i'm never going to use them and it was explained to me the reasoning behind that because the development of the brain the critical thinking those aspects that continue to be developed are the same exact ways that we see the improvements and the connectivity and the critical thinking and the exploration pieces of our brain that comes with computer science and the last myth that i want to share with you that probably is the greatest myth of all yet gives us the most power and when i share that with you i think it's important and critical because the myth that says to be loving or kind or compassionate in our society is to be weak you can't be kind you can't be loved especially in the business setting for sure in the political setting because you're just going to get run over and the reason and the truth behind that is that's a myth because to show love kindness and compassion is the most powerful thing that we can ever demonstrate in the society that we live in and how does this tie in with the potential that we have just this last weekend we had an opportunity and it was so inspiring in las lunas high school we hosted the first ever governor's stem challenge where many students came with their ideas of how they can make new mexico healthier and safer and it was great to see the talent that we have all across the state of new mexico and it was inspiring to see all that took place by giving you the opportunity and sharing with educators the resources and the support what we want to make sure that we do is to provide the curriculum opportunities to assist every single one of you students to explore to imagine to create to utilize your computer science research you utilize your computer science opportunities into making this world a more kind compassionate and loving environment that is the goal of each one of us and the responsibility that we all have and what a wonderful way and a wonderful opportunity to join in together on this possibility with each one of you thank you so much for joining us here in new mexico we welcome you all and wish you the best of luck thank you so much one more round of applause for our lieutenant governor of mexico thank you all right to close us out today i'd like to welcome back to the stage principal rosetta and sfis senior vernon tenorio vernon will be giving us our benediction today so please come on to the stage thank you audience thank you panel and awardees and at this time i'd like to welcome vernon tenorio from santa domingo pueblo please stand and remove your hats for our
