hi welcome to session five of the AI 101 for teachers professional learning series now that we've made it to the end of the series you may be wondering so now what how can I bring what I have learned into my classroom in this session we will explore resources that you can use in your classroom tomorrow we will also discuss topics for ating new AI tools resources and curricula let's get started as we start thinking about bringing AI to the classroom it is essential to distinguish between teaching with AI and teaching about AI when we teach with AI we are using AI as a tool to enhance teaching and learning when we teach with AI we are often also teaching students how to use AI as a tool when we teach about AI we teach students what AI is and how it works as with any technology we want students to move Beyond simply consuming the technology we want students to have the knowledge they need to be creators and critical evaluators of the technology you might be thinking if I want to teach about AI how do I know what I should be teaching what do my students really need to know we are in the early stages of AI in education although Comprehensive High high quality curricula may not be plentiful at the moment it is available and new curriculum will become more widely available over time these are some things to consider When selecting the curricula you will use with your students does the curricula provide teacher supports like lesson plans and Student Activities is there a focus on what AI is and how it works will students have the opportunity to think critically about the societal impacts of AI in a field often surrounded by hype and misinformation the curriculum should strive to dispel common misconceptions about AI clarifying its limitations and demystifying the fears around it always remember that teaching AI is not solely about the technology itself but also about cultivating critical thinking and informed judgment in students regarding its applications and implications let's take a look at an example of curriculum designed to teach students about AI hi my name is Anita dbar laen I taught artificial intelligence and machine learning to high school students for the last two years from the how AI Works page you'll notice a series of videos that c.org has put together to clearly explain different components of artificial intelligence though these could be Standalone videos each is supported with a comprehensive lesson plan with various components designed to make a learning process streamlined and efficient these elements are organized to provide both Educators and students with a cohesive and engaging learning experience let's take a look at the first lesson as you slowly scroll through the lesson plan take note that each lesson comes fully equipped with a complete set of resources to Aid in teaching including slides and activity guides clearly stated objectives warm up activities and guided notes accompany each lesson in addition to high quality videos you also find helpful teaching tips to enhance your delivery and a list of additional resources for further exploration all of these elements are meticulously designed to provide a rich wellrounded educational experience take time to become familiar with the material as you navigate through the lesson as we dive deeper into the course material it's important to highlight that some lessons come with interactive and engaging widgets these aren't just eyecatching elements they're designed with a pedagogical Focus to help simplify complex AI Concepts and make them more accessible to students to give you handson experience let's jump into our first activity recognizing fish this exercise is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of machine learning which is a subset of AI here we'll be training about distinguish between images of fish and those that are not fish allow me to demonstrate as you can see I'm providing input data to the bot by categorizing their images so how does the AI bot use this data essentially it takes the information we provided whether an image represent a fish or not and looks for patterns that it can use to identify a fish over time and with enough data the bot becomes increasingly accurate at identifying fish thereby giving us a simplified but impactful glimpse into how machine learning algorithms work based on the training provided the next step is to test the AI to see how well it is learn to identify fish this will involve presenting the bot with new unseen images and evaluating its ability to correctly categorize them as fish or not fish your students will be able to analyze the results of the training and how the opportunity to continue training the bot to increase the accuracy the second part of the lesson is a more openended as students explore their own ideas and feelings about the implications of labeling data let's check out another interactive lesson on how neuron networks work just as our brains have neurons connected by synapsis neuron networks have layers of mathematical neurons that process information and adapt based on patterns they find allowing them to make decisions or predictions in this lesson students watch a video introduce producing neuron networks and then experience a gget simulating a video recommender system that makes recommendations based on certain input once they understand how the widget Works they have the opportunity to customize a widget in this recommendation similar to how a newer Network can customize its recommendations on popular media sites they also examine how the recommendations they see are limited by the data that the network uses leading to a discussion on how they can gather more data to make sure diverse opinions are represented let's check out another engaging lesson that uses the unplugged activity in the computer vision lesson students start by observing and evaluating optical illusions after watching a video that explains how computer Vision Works and how computer process visual information they design and test algorithm that uses a network to decide what number is shown on a seven segment display we recognize that not every educational setting allows for extended periods of instructions for those who are pressed for time we offer a optimized alternative how AI Works in a day this is a condensed version of the course specifically tat for educators who have who only have a single day or precisely 65 minutes to dedicate to teaching AI this compact lesson ensures that the essential topics are covered efficiently without sacrificing educational impact throughout this professional learning series we have learned a lot about teaching with AI artificial intelligence has opened up extraordinary possibilities for revolutionizing Education changing how we approach teaching and learning it promises to deliver personalized adaptive learning experiences for students while providing Educators with tools to optimize their teaching strategies and reduce their workload like any tool generative AI tools have strengths and weaknesses one significant consideration for teachers is whether the generative AI tools meet the needs of their classrooms when considering which AI tool you will use you may want to consider the following was the tool designed to be used in an educational setting does the teacher have visibility into how students are interacting with the AI tool what guard rails are in place to ensure student safety let's take a look at a tool that is designed specifically for use in K12 education greetings excellent Educators my name is Michelle with KH academy by now you've seen the tremendous benefits of using artificial intelligence to supplement your teaching in the classroom well I'm here to introduce you to cono KH Academy's AI driven teaching assistant and student tutor it's built on the latest Cutting Edge artificial intelligence it's it's supported by all of our trusted and standard aligned content and it's Guided by humans and classroom teachers like me here at Con Academy conmigo has many exciting features and activities this video will showcase some of the ways that cono can transform into the teaching assistant that you've always wanted features like the class snapshot it's like a thermometer for your students progress get realtime feedback from our reporting tools on where your students might need a little extra help and what they should be celebrated for are you teaching a subject that's new to you or something that may not be in your wheelhouse the refresh my knowledge feature will help you fill in your own gaps so you're ready to teach your students lastly with the cocreative rubric feature we can help you customize your rubric to go along with your style of teaching so you can keep your students engaged with goals that interest them kigo is already being used in classrooms and school leaders are already seeing the benefit it's just another teacher a a assistant that is going to try to help them succeed and that's what I love about it it's just a beautiful tool again teaching assistant tutor what more could we want in education so let's get right to the magic of kigo I'm going to go ahead and select the class snapshot button and then I'm going to let kigo know which class I'd like information on and with one click of the button kmo is going to give me a highlevel overview of my students performance ments the last 7 Days highlighting key areas such as recent activity course Mastery progress assignments and skill development kigo then gives me additional prompts which tell me which students I should celebrate what students I need to check on which students are 25% to their Mastery goal and kigo will also group my students for me based on their recommendations which is so helpful I love to celebrate my students so normally I select this first option right here here today I really think I need to check on which students need additional support kigo gives me a list of students I should check in on and suggest that I view my student skill report and it even provides me this link so it's super accessible thanks for giving me a heads up about Douglas could you help me draft a progress report that I can send to his family oh this is great oh wait I forgot Douglas's mom speaks Spanish could you please translate to Spanish oh this is wonderful wonderful wonderful integrating kigo class snapshot into my classroom routine definitely helps me support my students by providing me with data that I can use to help drive my instruction thanks so much kigo if you're like me you've moved around a grade or two or maybe you've been asked to sub for a subject that you're not exactly comfortable with maybe this is your first year in the classroom let's jump in and ask kigo to help us refresh our knowledge so the first thing I want to do is I'm going to select the refresh my knowledge button and cono needs a little bit more information so how about Romeo and Juliet ninth grade great once I've provided that information to kigo it gives me the option of do I want kigo to quiz me on the topic or would I like to learn through conversation learn through conversation please great um kigo gives me a quick overview of five major Concepts in the play how about a character analysis so kigo is going to ask me a question that I may have to answer for my students you know what no I cannot that's perfectly okay thank you kigo is so understanding and so kigo is going to break it down for me so I'm able to refresh my knowledge on Romeo and Juliet therefore I'm able to teach my students better thanks kigo now with all this we're going to want to make sure we assess where our students are with what they're being taught so we'll need some helpful rubrics to figure that out good thing that's one of K Migo's Specialties once I select the cocreate a rubric feature cono requests the objective for for the lesson and wants to know what I'm planning to grade if I know the standard I can include that as well my students are going to be writing a research paper for the science lesson that we just finished kigo will then ask me a series of questions throughout this process so that we're truly collaborating to cocreate the perfect rubric that I want once I've answered all of K Migo's questions the Magic Begins and cono creates a rubric that is detailed and specific so my students will know exactly what they're being graded on this is awesome thanks so much for saving me so much time kigo pretty cool right as you can see incorporating conmigo into your classroom is going to be a game changer kigo insights and suggestions will enhance classroom instruction and learning while saving you time and energy so you'll have more time to focus on what's important your students check out kigo for yourself at con academy.org or in our con Academy for Teacher social media groups full

are you able to identify Trends and spot areas of improvement to adjust teaching strategies accordingly promote active dialogue does the tool promote active dialogue between you and your students let's take a look at an example of an AI assisted assessment tool for writing hi I'm Mandy Figaroa the product owner for the Criterion interactive prototype and I'll be giving you a walkthrough of our application this product provides examples of how AI can help but not replace teachers in the classroom by providing Time Savings and structure but it still relies on the teacher for HandsOn guidance and coaching for their students the Prototype is built around this user flow but we'll be focusing on the places where AI offers teachers and students the most benefit scoring and providing feedback on student writing to begin with the teacher creates the assignment and then the student will work on planning their essay and writing their first draft the main focus for the first draft is planning and executing on that plan the focus of the second draft is revising the essay to ensure it closely aligns with the standards of a specific genre in this case persuasive writing teachers will be able to review the AI generated provisional scores and feedback before the students begin revising their essays the focus of the third draft is editing the essay to improve spelling and grammatical correctness teachers will again be able to review the AI generated provisional scores and feedback before students begin on this phase teachers who tested the protot type liked the structure of the app to help them manage writing assignments in their classroom we'll start our demo with the setup and planning phase which will guide teachers and students through getting started and creating their first draft the first step is for teachers to create the assignment for their students in the teacher application we guide teachers step by step through the creation process they can choose the genre the student will be writing in the learning objectives the assignment will focus on and then they can choose which writing prompts will be available for the student to respond to we're switching to the student application now research shows students often struggle with how to plan their writing but the more time students spend planning their essay the more effective they are at writing and the higher quality their writing is so we scaffold them through the planning process students brainstorm main ideas prioritize their main ideas and generate supporting details related to each main idea using a validated instructional strategy after the student has completed the planning phase they can use that plan to write a first draft for example here the student is writing their first main idea paragraph and has access to to the main idea and supporting details that they generated during brainstorming after writing each paragraph students can request AI generated feedback from the system we use AI models to do analysis of their paragraph to identify how closely their paragraph aligns with the supporting details that they included in their plan and to identify if the paragraph is too long or too short and if the student is making good transitions between their supporting details as students are working on their first draft teachers may want to review the system generated feedback with them to help their student incorporate more of their main ideas and supporting details into their essay after the student has finished writing and adjusting all of their paragraphs then they can submit their first draft at this point the teacher will be able to review the essay and the AI generated scoring which brings us to the revision phase the next step is for teachers to use the teacher application to read the students essay that they've submitted and then review the AI generated scores that we we have given them based on the rubric the scoring is built around teachers have the opportunity to view the rubric at many points during this process and a planned future feature would allow teachers to customize the rubric to allow align with their state standards and classroom scoring policies once the teacher reviews all of the scores and overrides any that they disagree with then they are able to move on to the next step which is reviewing the revision tasks that we have generated for the student these are based on their rubric scores and give the student system generated feedback in the form of a praise a question and a suggestion to help them improve their rubric score the teacher has the opportunity to prioritize this feedback and they can edit or hide any feedback that they disagree with as well as creating additional feedback messages after teachers see how their students are scoring on the persuasive writing rubric they may decide to teach a lesson about how to identify and address an alternate position in an essay for example but they won't need to individually add that feedback message to each student essay who needs it the program has already done that for them once the teacher has finished reviewing the student's first draft they can send it back to the student to make changes based on the feedback they received after the student makes those changes they'll send the essay back to their teacher and the teacher will go through that same process except that instead of looking at the revision tasks to align with the genre the student is writing in they will be looking at editing tasks which are related to the punctuation capitalization usage and spelling of the essay once the teacher is able to see which grammar errors are most common they may decide to pull aside a small group or individual students for further instruction on specific types of errors after the teacher has reviewed the second draft of the essay the student will have the opportunity to work on it again to create their third draft in the student application at this point they can read their essay and choose which of the categories they'd like to work on capitalization usage punctuation or spelling we show them all of the errors our AI models have detected they can choose to make changes to their essay to resolve an error or dismiss any error they disagree with before submitting their essay at every step of the process teachers can reinforce their students critical thinking skills they are receiving AI generated feedback but is it accurate how should a student react if they disagree one of our Middle School teachers summed it up this way the AI can only go so far you're the critical thinker here I need you to decide is that the word you meant or like that's a s fragment once the student has submitted their final draft of the essay the teacher will be able to review it one last time in the teacher application teachers will be able to see the final AI generated scores and make any necessary adjustments before the students see their score as you can see there are many steps in this flow where teachers will get the benefit of AI scoring and feedback generation to help make the review process faster for a whole classroom of students the insights report is available to help teachers once the assignment is started and will help them track class progress and begin to see patterns of common problem areas for their students a middle school Ela teacher who tested our prototype summed it up this way I mean it can grade papers in minutes where it takes me two to three weeks right this will help free up time for teachers to spend more time coaching their students based on how their students are performing and that's where teachers shine thank you as an educator ready to delve into the exciting world of artificial intelligence you're poised to add a valuable layer to your teaching experience learning about AI can initially be intimidating however effective AI education is significantly enhanced by an Educator's personal enthusiasm and dedication to Student Success joining us for this professional learning series was a great first step but your journey does not need to end here with ai's momentum and popularity continuing to increase more and more information is available online as you seek out professional development opportunities in artificial intelligence consider these four components for impactful teaching and learning knowledge and skill development a robust AI training program should deepen your understanding of AI and its various aspects from the fundamentals to more complex topics it should not only enhance your know knowledge but also equip you with the skills necessary to integrate AI into your teaching understanding capabilities risks and ethics the program should help you grasp the potential of AI as well as its limitations and potential risks it's also crucial to explore ethical considerations in AI such as privacy and bias knowing these aspects will ensure that you can teach your students about the responsible use of AI Community relevant AI Solutions AI has the potential to solve real world problems a valuable AI program will enable you to identify and explore how AI can address issues within your student communities this approach will make learning more relatable and impactful to your students practical engagement in AI creation theory is only half of the battle a good training program should offer practical ways for unior students to engage in AI creation this could include projects activities or sandbox environments where you can experiment with building simple AI models there are increasingly more professional development opportunities available let's learn more about one of these opportunities well at one point AI was in the distant future right well that future is now so as Educators we need to prepare our students to interact with AI in in safe thoughtful intelligent ways most of the time when people hear artificial intelligence especially a teacher you are a little intimidated so you're thinking I can't teach that I'm not that techsavvy I don't know that much about artificial intelligence but after going through the AI Explorations course I gained way more confidence even as I was going along the course so there were sometimes where there might have been a term or a concept that I was totally unfamiliar with but by the end of the lesson then I knew more so to become the learner first that is what really empowered me as an educator AI exploration provides a variety of free opportunities and resources from Educators from our online PD course to the HandsOn AI project guides to our webinar series and our pln community the AI HandsOn guide and the isty course that I took about artificial intelligence really gave me everything I needed to teach my fifth grade class about artificial intelligence I'm really inspired by the fact that they're able to grasp onto these Concepts and I've even had some students realize I could be that person to create something using artificial intelligence I think learning about AI is really fun AI impacts Our Lives cuz you use the Google search you use robots like Alexa and Siri and Google you use all sorts of things if I did create things in the future with AI I would make a robot that brings you snacks when you can just watch TV and stuff I really hope that students who experience this program most of all walk away feeling empowered feeling like artificial intelligence isn't just something that happens to them but it's something that they can control something that they can design something that they can influence something that they can bring their values to that brings us to the end of our journey together hopefully this Series has provided you with the knowledge and skills you need to start exploring and forming your own opinions about Ai and education visit the ai101 for teers website at code.org ai101 to revisit the videos in this series and explore additional resources from code.org ETS IST and KH Academy thank you for joining us I'm excited to see how you will transform the face of Education using artificial intelligence oh
