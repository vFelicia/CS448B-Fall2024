There's so many computer science jobs out there that are not being filled. So the more computer science teachers we have in our school systems the more students we will be able to reach. And getting past that initial fear of what computer sciences is, is what's gonna change the whole field of computer science. The curriculum is very accessible to firsttime teachers. I think it's also accessible to experienced teachers. If you didn't have any background knowledge of computers, technology, computer science whatever the case may be, you can successfully teach this course. So it's great. Having lots of teachers in the classroom will give us the ability to adapt to a future that frankly none of us can predict. The workplace has changed. Education has to change. And this is all part of helping to prepare students for the world that they're going to work in. If you have an interest you need to go for it! And you need to do that really not just for yourself but certainly to benefit your students. They need stuff that is relevant and this... I think this is it. Yeah.
