hmm um do uh bad foreign hmm so ladies and gentlemen the session will begin in five minutes thank you so hmm do so over the years i've come to realize how impactful and influential ai is as a technology and it's so important to understand the different ways in which that technology works to make it less intimidating to make it clear that it's a series of human decisions that we can control rather than um this futuristic scifi uncontrollable thing that is out of reach in terms of us being able to change where do you think you're going well i'm not going that way so i think that there's a lot of benefit there's a lot to gain from involving yourself and really understanding the details of how this technology works is something that will influence your life and the life of everyone that you love and the life of everyone around you and that's why i would encourage young people especially to even if they don't want to be an engineer and do it for the rest of their life uh to to really just properly engage in in getting an uh a sense or an understanding of the basics of what it means for uh the technology to work if you're someone that cares passionately about people and you have an interest in computer science the field definitely needs you there's so much that we can learn from you and learn from your empathy and learn from your attention to the experiences of other people we desperately need diverse perspectives in this field to shape a future vision for ai that is inclusive that is impactful in the right ways and is attentive to the concerns of those that are most vulnerable in our society i think that's it good morning everyone oh we can do better than that good morning i'm jackie smalls i'm the chief programs officer at code.org and i'm so excited to be here really it's kind of personal because when i joined code.org 18 months ago in march of 2020 it was announced that we were in a pandemic and the world shut down great time to start a new job right but there are many challenges but i just knew that there was challenges that i was facing was not like the challenges our teachers were facing so before we began today i really would like for everyone to join me if you could push away from your tables stand up i'm not going to make you do anything crazy i promise and let's really give the teachers and all the school systems a round of applause for all that they've done to make sure and keep standing because i also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone that made this happen for us this week hasn't it been great all right great great stretch break you may be seated thank you so much for that i'm also excited today because eight years ago i shared the stage with my friend and colleague steven pruitt i came on to the stage and it was my responsibility at the national teachers association conference to introduce steven as the keynote speaker and we were so excited when i looked out into the audience it was filled with teachers but not just filled with teach they were lined up on the walls they were in the aisles the room had reached capacity because that day stephen announced the release of the next generation science standards and so that was an amazing opportunity and here we are today to listen to the lessons learned from that process and how it might be applied to the cs movement so without further ado i'm going to ask stephen to introduce himself good morning oh very good it's so good so nor so i've been able to speak in public now a couple times since you know everything's shut down and normally i pretend i'm on mute for the first couple of sentences but since i'm having to wear the mask i couldn't do that because you wouldn't know what i was doing so yeah it's i think it's a protocol now so i'm stephen pruitt i am president of the southern regional education board um i guess it's sometimes i don't know that i need to say southern because as soon as you hear me talk you're kind of clear that um he's not from here um but uh we i'm president of the regional education board uh former commissioner of education for the commonwealth of kentucky uh i was the the lead for the development of the next generation science standards and most importantly i was a high school science teacher that was always my most important job but i've had a i've had a lot of luck and a lot of great opportunities in my life one of them was to work with this wonderful person to my right who she hates it when i bring this up but i'm going to anyway so jackie was in the army and chose to go work to teach elementary um and that's i mean and when i say she was in the army i mean she you know has a brilliant science and engineering mind and where most of us that have that kind of training go into high school she chose to go into elementary and i don't know about you but once they get under 14 they got to be somebody else's um because i i i can't do that so i always loved to brag on the fact that jackie had a mission and she worked on that and a lot of kids got a lot of benefit thank you so much for that all right well let's get started how about that so i have a bunch of questions but we really want this to be interactive you can ease drop in this conversation or you can participate so we would love for you to come up to the mic at any time not just wait until the end you know that awkward pause does anyone have any questions please come to the mics and we'll make sure that we recognize you during our conversation so the first question i have stephen in terms of you just spoke of the next generation science standards what a small project we worked on together small project what can we learn in the cs movement from that journey like what are the lessons so the journey i know you can go on and on for days about the journey but what about the lessons what would you have done differently well you know the i would say that the first thing that comes to mind is you need to recognize that any type of movement in education is going to take time um you know no great education idea ever died in the vision phase uh you know it always it's it's about implementation um and so you know when you go into this you have to know that this is not going no matter how dedicated how committed you are to a particular issue it takes time because you have to make a case you know i like to say that education is not rocket science because rocket science is actually easier um now given i'm a chemist so maybe i'm not the best person to make that comment but you know the point is you're dealing with human beings so it takes time to build that that understanding another lesson i would say is ownership um we uh one thing i think that we did a very good job of in that room that you talked about you know we had people stand up if they were part of a writing team if they were part of a review team if they were and at the end i mean there were there were about 5 000 people in that room and at the end more than 95 of the people in the room were standing because i can tell you that states do not like to have things put on them they want to feel that ownership and so finding a way to help people become what i call shareholders instead of stakeholders you know stakeholders kind of comes from that time of ringling brothers when somebody held a large stake while somebody else swung a really big hammer near their head a shareholder somebody that now owns it and they invest in it um and then i guess you know the thing that that you know i'm not sure completely what i would do different but i think there would be some things that we would push harder and one of the biggest ones is clarity around what the initiative is and how it fits into an overall educational scheme i think we did a pretty good job with that but the connector we didn't necessarily make as well as i thought we could have was around workforce um we'll talk a little bit more about that in a little bit but you know in the world of science and in the world of computer science there are people who don't know what those things are so you have to find a way to talk their language and help them see what you see but how it's in the context as a former commissioner of education i can tell you every day there was somebody that had something that i needed to do every day it was like oh you got to do this oh you got to do that and it becomes really kind of white noise and you end up making decisions based on you know your advisors or whatever the people that got to me the most were how the ones that could show me how what they were pushing fit into the overall educational context and i think computer science is a particular one there that that would be a good focus no questions yet don't be shy all right i have another question for you many states have adopted cs standards and we've been working towards ensuring cs is accessible to all students which comes with many challenges as we all know what should we consider as we reach the milestone of 51 of high schools now offer cs and we applauded that this this week but we still have a long way to go so what should we consider in the next mile well so there's a couple of things i think obviously the push to continue to offer the opportunity to be a part of computer science but i think you're going to have to make that case of why that's going to be important for that student's future and not just that they take a computer science class you know we'll we're going to be living in a world where if you don't understand the thinking involved around this you're not going to be a viable member of the economy so that would be one part but the other part that i would push already even in those 51 percent is equity and the equity here is this there there are lots of things listed on a course of study in schools across our country that doesn't mean students actually get to take them so one of the things that that i've pushed even in accountability is that we lessen the amount that we rely on statewide assessment and look more at what we're providing opportunities to do so example here would be if you offer computer science fourth period of course everybody knows fourth period is the longest period because that's lunch period but that's also the same time that you're offering remediation courses for students that need to be caught up because it's the longest period and you're offering band that same period because it's the longest because it takes them a while to get out to practice and you're offering ap courses that period you don't actually have opportunity to take the class or what i would think opportunity so one of the things that i would push for in the next mile is how many students are actually getting to take those courses are we giving that access to each student and not just you know and i'm very particular about saying all because all is a way to mask things but are our students of color students of poverty uh are are females being able to to be actually in those courses or is our master schedule actually prohibiting it so you brought it up so i'm going to continue with what you said about access and actual participation because we know that there's a difference so what do we need to do to close the gap that we know that exists in cs for black students young women hispanic students native students what do we really need to focus on to really close that gap well i i think that part of it is the folks that are making decisions about education in at the school and district level there have to broaden their perspective beyond math and literacy and we we tend to get very caught up in the accountability aspect of this and it's one of the reasons why i've been proponent of actually making those changes to accountability systems so that people i'm not saying math and literacy aren't important they obviously are but if we really want to educate a whole child to let them have access to what eventually will be our workforce part of that focus has to be re the recognition that while i'm trying to catch kids up those kids also deserve opportunities but when it comes specific to our students of color you know we have a little bit of a chicken and an egg issue here in that they aren't seeing people in the industry that look like them so we got to have very specific strategies on how we're recruiting starting in middle school students of color students of poverty into career pathways that are central around computer science cyber security i.t all so that eventually students it becomes just more normal that that i i say okay because i mean i think there's some truth in the fact that if i don't see anybody that looks like me doing it then i'm not supposed to do it so i think we've got to work on both levels we've got to work on the recruitment at the workforce level but we've got to increase the pipeline it's not a leaky pipeline there's no pipeline or there it's a trickle i guess but we've got to really do a better job of identifying and recruiting students at that middle school level just to make them aware of what's there you know i mean um the opportunities that students are afforded in the workforce of actually especially in a postcovered world of being able to work remotely that's going to be something that this generation of kids are going to like so we should promote that so i'm going to push on that a little bit because i could say for myself i didn't get support or see myself in a stem field until it came to college and i went to historical black college south carolina state university i know there's somebody from south carolina in here however what you said middle school and high school what about the k5 why don't we start at k5 because many of us that's what we're doing and actually we're focused on because we can see if we get them early and can see themselves early maybe they might stay and continue beyond high school because they think it's an opportunity so i absolutely think k5 should be engaged in work around computer science my comments were more around the fact that about middle school is when you start or when you should start exposing students to potential careers but why would i do something in middle school for a career of something that i've never had experience with before that so having students engage in that in elementary school is i think is a really important thing i think that to do that there's got to be an investment in our teachers though because and frankly an investment in the understanding of our administrators because again if i'm more worried about math and literacy i'm not having time for computer science science social studies and all of those things are actually important for a student to be a whole student that becomes a member of a society by which they can pursue their version of the american dream so having a k5 experience in uh in computer science that is able to be communicated to people who don't and again this kind of goes back to what i was saying earlier about communicating it to the general populace i think an unfortunate aspect at times in elementary school is parents look at what kids are doing with computer science as fun and not necessarily learning and i think we have to find a way to reposition that that they are yeah they're having fun but i mean let's face it in science i mean you know one of the reasons i decided to teach was because i could blow stuff up legally you know i mean you have fun but we've got to figure out how to communicate that to the parents there then when they get to middle school they're able to look back and go okay i've had a little experience with this coding thing and a little bit i understand about what this could be and then we can start to let them explore what careers are out there in middle school by the way you would have been a great elementary school teacher because the kids would have focused on your socks yeah i i you know my wife won't let me buy normal socks and it's partly because i'm colorblind so i really don't know what i have on right now and we could talk about why ngss are the colors yeah so we have victoria i think i don't have my glasses on but i think victoria has a question for us hi hi good morning thank you so much for being here you've mentioned really important shareholders in the education of our students you've mentioned teachers administrators parents how can we get school counselors on board especially in the middle and high school when a lot of times students have to go through them to figure out what classes should i take what can i take yeah that's that oh man that's a tough one yeah that's a tough one um you know the so i'll start with a more basic comment and then build it a little bit i hope one thing is we probably should start letting counselors be counselors and not test administrators in fact i'll never forget i was walking into the kentucky department of education and i'm seeing all these tweets from counselors saying they're at the state assessment conference like why in the world are all the dang counselors at this test conference so i walked in the room and and i knew a lot of them and i said why are y'all all here and they're like well we're the the building assessment coordinator i'm like okay i want all of you right now get out your phones hit a hit two and put your principal's name in there and say commissioner pruitt said i should not be here you can imagine the emails i got later but um but i think that's you know one thing is we need to give counselors the room to be counselors and not duties as assigned that's one another one is and i i've always been a little bit of a proponent of having additional support in schools either through community partnerships or through an actual fte employee that whose real focus it is is to connect students to careers especially in the immediate area but that are in high need um i mean so i have a degree in chemistry i know in general well a little more in general i know what chemists do but your average high school counselor probably couldn't really communicate that very well because they never did it and even as a chemistry major and with a chemistry degree i couldn't necessarily tell you all the stuff that's out there for industry to do because i was a teacher i didn't go into industry and then come come back so i think that it's somewhat of an unrealistic expectation to have to think that our counselors can automatically make that connection to workforce and to computer science so that means that we've got to do some investment in either extra people or helping them understand in the area that their school's in or as a country what our highest high needs sectors are and certainly computer sciences is that it's a tough nut to crack because let's face it the other again i keep going back to accountability a lot of our counselors are focused on how do i make sure kids get into courses that are going to meet graduation requirements and that are going to help our accountability scores and the first one i can get the second one yeah i think we got to do a better job and we have another question um over here i believe our friends from code crew that's correct uh good morning former commissioner and um and my name is maker egg i'm the executive director one of the founders of code crew which is based in memphis which is in your region and i am i'm actually asking this question because we've been very active in tennessee around computer science education policy um and i wanted to ask based on your experience as a former commissioner in kentucky our neighbor to the north um what would have been the most effective way to lobby or persuade uh you as a commissioner of education to increase access to computer science education uh as the commission of education and such as like high every high school offering computer science classes and other important initiatives that's a great question so i um you wouldn't have to do a lot for me to convince me of it so i'll tell you i'll tell you a little bit about what um what i think helped my colleagues uh who may not have had that i think the first thing the first advice i would give you is recognize the amount of um people who are trying to convince you to do something okay so what's going to distinguish your position over those that everybody else has i mean uh you know my good friend kirsten's here she'll tell you here this too i mean on a daily basis i'd get i'd get anywhere from 100 to 300 emails a day just to tell me hey you need to do x when i was doing the standards in georgia the science standards in georgia i had a lady i don't know what her name was to this day her name but i just called her the folic acid lady because she called me every friday morning at 10 o'clock to tell me how important folic acid was you know and i'm like yeah i get that folic acid is very important but what do you want me to do with that well i want it in the standards like well what do you want in the standards to say i understand the importance of folic acid you know and and i mean i'm saying it's partly because it's a little bit funny but partly because that is also very typical of what a commissioner deals with you have people that are coming with these dis with something they are very passionate about and it's possibly very important but it's disjointed from the bigger picture that i'm trying to create as a commissioner so in doing this my first suggestion would be connect it to something that they see as value and give them a path forward so you know one of the things that that you know i give hottie big props for with code.org was you know there was a time when everybody's like we got to make this a a graduation requirement we've got to make our graduation program we all everybody wants to make everything a graduation requirement you know in most schools you got you know you got 24 options because there's four there's six periods a day four years right you can't make everything a graduation requirement so you have to figure out how to get there and what heidi did really well was he started saying look let's just get it in schools to start with because at that time we didn't even have it in schools so what he and then of course now we're seeing where states are making a high school graduation requirement but what i think he did well was gave people a path forward so when you're doing your work with the commissioner it's how do you help move this you know so this is where i want to be but this is a path that you could go to get there then the last thing i would just share is you've got to talk about it in a language they understand and it's um i mean for me in kentucky you know especially in appalachia you know you the familial bond was so strong in eastern kentucky that a kid was would not leave eastern kentucky because of their family even if they could have a better life so one of the reasons why computer science became a big part for us too was that we could see how students could still continue to live with their family unit but be able to get a degree that would actually be able to make for a better economy so when you're talking to legislators policy makers they understand workforce they understand what it means to have a workforce but you've got to sometimes help connect those dots we have another question hello my name is becky muller and i'm a code.org facilitator csf and csd but i work at a stem school and we have adopted the ngss standards um as soon as they came out but colorado did it later on and but what i'm asking is can you kind of go back and tell me how did you put how where where was your concept of being able to include those engineering standards within ngss and and is there some way that we could attach some kind of computer science standards in the same way or through those crosscutting concepts as you introduce them to students yeah absolutely in fact i even said back when we were developing in gss if you don't do computer science within gss then you're actually not fully preparing students for 21st century so there's a practice you know of of computational thinking and and we were a little limited uh i mean i'm just going to be kind of blunt here um you know the ngss were developed based on the framework for k12 science education which came from the national academies and the decision was made at that committee that we would stay with the natural sciences so that's because we got a lot of push to to do computer science standards too and it just wasn't in the scope for us to do the standards for computer science and that so we tried to give entry points and i think that there's a couple i think that you know obviously the practice of computational thinking is there but the engineering standards are most definitely there but y'all the instructional part is wide open for computer science so i was actually sharing this with kirsten earlier when i was in kentucky we worked with collegeboard and code.org to take the computers ap computer science principles course and we offered it as a science course that a kid counts toward their graduation we train science teachers to teach it and in apcsp you know students do six to eight projects well what we did to justify it being a science was we said we trained the science teachers to help the students create those projects that prove they know science now they weren't doing a traditional science class they weren't standing at the board they weren't necessarily even doing labs in the traditional way but the stuff that came out of it was incredible i mean we had kids that were able to predict glacial movement that could predict weather because they were able to actually construct the computer modeling which by the way is another practice so the instruction was actually wide open and it fully aligned to ngss it fully aligned to csp but it was an instructional technique more so than a standards technique does that make sense yes it does thank you thank you welcome thank you for that i don't know if you recall stephen i know yes i'll make sure we'll get to the question i don't know if you recall but we had this one time when i said why do we have to label things life science earth science a student doesn't necessarily especially at elementary need to know that they're working in life science and that to me is speaks to the integration right because they're actually engaging in the content if they're using the science and engineering practices that's what we want students to do across all disciplines not just within science but in computer science and in ela so i just want to bring and we're going to get back to integration at k5 level yeah yeah because i would like to talk a little bit more about that because it it's uh yeah it can be an issue we'll talk about that hi good morning my name is dr marlo barnett and i am from chicago illinois so i have a question i wanted to go back to connecting the dots and so one thing the pandemic has brung out is the digital divide and so in connecting the dots how do you get your colleagues to understand that the digital divide has become greater and how computer science plays into that especially when we're talking about devices internet connectivity so how are you getting your colleagues to understand the bigger picture um and that all of this um is a part of affects and impacts computer science as well yeah you know i think we've got a great could y'all all hear the question okay i i i should have been asking that question all along um so i think that we've got a prime opportunity because that's because the digital divide has been on people's minds i mean i meet with the the chiefs in the south or the commissioners in the south i meet with you know i'm still connected with ccsso and i think there is a realization that the digital divide is a real thing what i'm not convinced of is that we have made the jump from the digital divide because we need to help students who are behind to actually this is a wave of comple of the future where we're going to have this recognition that the world will never go back to the way it was right and then i would actually go even one more step to say to recognize the digital divide is to also recognize the limitations placed on a student for their future um the the reality is that i that working in computer science is going to afford students greater autonomy and greater opportunity in that field exactly and that field is going to be at home they're not going to report to an office so you know there so there's a i think where everybody is is we realize there's a digital vibe i mean look you can have fiber running underneath your building in downtown atlanta but if i can't afford to get to that then it's just cable running underneath the building so i think there's the recognition of that part i think that people realize that the world is not going to go back and actually it affords us the opportunity to and much to the chagrin of children across the nation snow days may not be a thing in the future exactly and but i don't know that we've made the next jump to say we're going to have a remote environment for the most part so we might need to help make connect those dots yeah that's what needs to get out yeah thank you hi hi i'm samantha i'm a regional partner with iowa and my question is if you have any tips around the different aspects of computer science that are bubbling up now similar to science where there's life science and earth science and all of that we have ai and data science and cyber security and um i think we're starting to see some confusion at least in our area of where the focus should be and i think most of us know that that's all part of computer science but how do we have a clear messaging to our states our regions and our districts and how do we deal with that so you want to go ahead go ahead all right this may be a minute so here's the picture i want to lay out for you and this this goes to the connecting dots and it goes to your question sreb we we've done we've done several things over the last several years in 2016 under the leadership of governor hutchinson in arkansas we did a commission report on computer science and pathways in 2019 we released a report called unprepared and unaware and earned 2018 2019 we followed that up with an economic impact of what will happen and let me just give you the short story here this is obviously was prepandemic and what we found was that there are people who are currently in the workforce who you know they're they're they're owning their homes they're going on vacations with their family life is good they're making money these folks also have high school diplomas or less all right so ages 25 to 35 is who we looked at and what we found was the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on the workforce over the next 10 years would be significant enough that a large majority of the current workforce in the south would be impacted by automation nai so we further looked and said what are the ages of these people's kids and we found that that they actually would be graduating around 2030 well those kids are 10 times more likely to go into the same line of work and have the same level of education as their parents so we followed that up with this economic impact and what we found was in the south alone now i understand how we did we defined the south sreb is from delaware don't laugh delaware yes you cannot buy sweet tea in the restaurants in delaware but we love them anyway okay but from delaware down to florida over to texas back up to arkansas kentucky okay 18 million unemployable adults by 2030. now not unemployed unemployable which means they do not have the skill to be involved in an environment or in an economy where food service already in the south is roughly 67 percent automatable by 2030 100 is going to be automatable you can already go to wendy's in some parts of the country and order and a robot prepares the food and it kind of shoots out of a little vending machine kind of deal so you think about 18 million unemployables that doesn't count their kids who if we haven't done the work that they learn in stem won't be able to be a part of that so advanced manufacturing welding carpentry and building the things that we've traditionally thought of as as kind of blue collar you know working with your hands not anymore they're actually going to be done using computer science i walked into henry henderson county high school in kentucky and you know when the commissioner comes to visit you know what they do is they strap roller skates on the person and they drag them all over the building you know and i love that i always did it after legislative session because god knows i needed to be out of the capitol and with kids after the legislative session and so i walk in and and um they were like we got to get you to the welding lab i'm like okay so they took me a few places and they got me there and i walk in and the kid's like oh thank goodness you're here i got something to show you i'm like okay great he said come here and push this button i said dude i'm from the south you know how many jokes start that way i'm not pushing this button and so so he says no no this is going to be safe i said okay so i'll go over and i push the button and he had put he had made this design to cut my name into this giant piece of metal on a plasma welder okay so i'm standing there talking to this kid i'm like well tell me a little bit about because you know it didn't happen immediately you had to cut it i said tell well tell me a little bit about this he said well you know the first thing is you know i had to select a metal because i wanted this to be something you can keep a long time so i'm thinking okay science structure and properties of matter awesome he said you know what took probably the the longest though was to code the machine i'm like okay all right so tell me more about that and he starts telling me how he had to learn to write lines of code how he had to calculate the angles of the r and the circle in the middle of the r and all that and i'm like man i bet your math teacher loves you he said i hate math he said i'm not very good at it i'm like dude i like the word dude if you hadn't figured it out dude you just talked about trigonometry you actually said sign sin not sign okay he said yeah i just did what i had to do to make this piece relevance matters and so if we're going to actually do the things that you're talking about with we do have to recognize artificial intelligence automation are going to be a significant part of our workforce and that covet accelerated dependence on automation by five years so we're not looking at 2030 anymore we're looking at 2025. so hopefully that that answers your question i mean like i said i'm sorry you had to stand there for that long but i'm really passionate about this we are going to be as a country in a world of hurt by 2030 if we have not significantly changed how we're approaching k12 and postsecondary and adult ed to upskill our populace to be able to work in this environment in which computer science is a key part of that economy darcy you have a question yes thanks that's actually a perfect segue to my question too so hi i'm darcy i'm from sacred heart university the regional partner in connecticut and i want to go back also to the description that you had about um the course scheduling right that okay there's access but is there really if this is scheduled at the same time as that and you know i have a lot of compassion for principals who are dealing with the real world and these real choices that that are that students are faced with and that they have to organize around and so i'm wondering if you have any strategies or thoughts about kind of just broadly breaking through the log jam of this idea of a zerosum game right that more space is less space for someone else um some other area and thinking about you know creating those whole students um you know at the at the secondary level we see that with these course offerings at the elementary level that often comes down to this conversation about minutes of instruction time for one thing or another so i wanted to know if you had any thoughts about kind of working through that um and so for example in ngss my background is in science education as well you know i know that there was so much care and attention done to identifying those standards in literacy and mathematics that related to the next generation science standards and i wonder if you feel that that attention to the potential for working across areas has been reciprocated by those other content areas and if you were seeing some progress at breaking through the zerosum game and if there are lessons that we can learn for computer science from that great question um big question but great question um so i i guess let me start with your second question about have other content areas reciprocated not as much as i would have hoped you know that there's a people are scared of the unknown and teachers by nature want to be the expert in the room and and i get that i mean i was in that room i i get it um so to just kind of throw stuff out there and hope that it sticks won't work now i will tell you this i have seen incredible science education instruction in elementary and i've seen some really bad instruction in high school okay and here's why i think i think that from the day we started the framework and then once the we started in gss everybody was worried about those poor elementary teachers you remember hearing all that oh they don't know the content oh they don't know this i don't know what i tell you what they do know they know good instruction and they know how you can integrate things um not that they always do but that how they can and i saw some so the rule when i was commissioned was you had to take me to at least one nontested science class which freaked out the superintendents because they were sometimes they were like i'm not sure if we have any and so but i saw incredible stuff in elementary school because because as a state before i became commissioner they had invested lots of training on how to use math english and science together but then you go to high school and i'm a former high school teacher so nobody get offended i'm talking about my own people here you know we just know how to do it just ask us um and and i mean i you know i'll never forget this one teacher telling me how if we don't teach the four phases of mitosis and won't be prepared for college and a college professor sitting six feet from her said i wish i wouldn't even teach that because we usually have to fix it you know and so but there was not an investment in high school like there was in elementary because the assumption was they knew the content and the reality is and i think this is true in computer science it's not about just the content it's about the thinking that goes into the content and the thinking of how instruction has to be cultivated the second part of your ques or the first part of your question you know i think that there's a big part of this that industry partners have to play if you're going to find room in the curriculum for for computer science um bill even building career pathways that start in high school that have dual enrollment and all that kind of stuff is not enough if you don't have industry partners at the table that say we need these kinds of people okay or these trainings so having i mean georgia has just uh we've been working with them they've just finished a pathway on nursing and there's nursing pathways cross country but the reason i think this one's going to work is wellstar who's the biggest healthcare provider in georgia has guaranteed every kid that graduates at every level an interview well guess what they got kids that are taking those courses now and i think we've got to do a better job of of local districts and states finding ways to partner with industry to give a a reason for that because i the biggest problem i see with k12 is we still look at things as a course code and a course name and not what they can the full collection of knowledge needs to be back by 12th grade to be successful at the next level thank you and we have two other questions i think but i just want to add we're focusing so much right now on k12 but what about teacher preparation if we're not changing what teach how teachers are learning we're still doing the same thing that we've done years ago and still teaching teachers that teach the same way we're not going to see change in k12 oh that's absolutely true right that's absolutely true absolutely true but we'll go to the next question okay hi dr pereira i am sherry mcguffin i'm stem coordinator from advanced kentucky so thank you for your work in kentucky we appreciate it always good to see you kentucky absolutely and so what my question revolves around advanced placement ap computer science principles apcsa and what is potentially seen and sometimes seen as a conflict with the dual credit courses and that's been one of the issues that we've had in kentucky getting in computer science into some of those schools where it does not exist is that it is seen as a competition between dual credit and sometimes in that mentality dual credit and computer science don't coexist because teachers aren't seen as qualified enough to teach those so i would ask what your advice is to alleviate that idea of competition and how we can help it to be seen as something that works with dual credit rather than a competitor yeah so i you know i i think the first thing you've got to realize is it is a competition it's unfortunate but it is and i don't believe that education made it a competition i think that parents and communities sort of did the idea that i can go and take a dual credit course and immediately have credit on my transcript and not have to take a test i think had a big allure to people i my advice is and you know we tried to do this when i was in kentucky is to try to lower that temperature about around the competition in fact even allowing the ap courses to count as dual credit i think that it's a lot of it's a lot of work on the front end of case making especially to parents and to administrators because let's face it to them it's also easier because you know there's usually a little bit of money involved especially if it's being taught on campus there is a lot of um uh i think perception that it's a little bit easier to do a dual credit because you don't have to deal with test security you don't have to deal with the perception of having to stop dropping tests kind of deal so my advice to you would be show people how those two things coexist and not just that they can but that they probably should because there are some things that kids do get a better benefit out of taking dual enrollment because ap doesn't offer it but there are also things that especially i mean you know we have one state in the south that has started requiring the ap test at the end of dual enrollment courses if there's a a match to verify that the dual enrollment course was actually at an appropriate level because there's people at the policy making level that are skeptical of dual enrollment too um but i think that making that case i mean i had parents when i was in kentucky that would come up because i you know i i'm a former ap teacher um and i had kids that would go down the road and take chemistry even for my first year class not even counting my ap class because they knew they had a better chance of getting a higher grade in there than they did in my class well they could make a high grade in my class but they have to work for it and um i'd have parents come up and say well why in the world would i do that when i can just go take that class why would i want them to take that test and i think we've got to figure out how as a school in your case as a school to communicate to the community how those things fit together and work together i don't know where it is now but you know one of the things that we worked on when i was in kentucky was a career pathway in computer science that included ap and dual enrollment so that there's actually a model there assuming it's still there that you can actually show to parents and say look there's value here for both of these and then you got to make that case thank you you're welcome and you know the cats are playing ut this weekend um i don't know where my tennessee guy went but there he is so um we have another question tuesday yep hi good morning uh thank you for all your work and i just want to say thank you for acknowledging that teachers bring so many strengths to the table and that we need to build off of those strengths and not just consider the deficit model my name is lee and eliza i'm the executive director at cs for all and we've been talking a lot about what schools and states can do but i want to shift the focus a little bit in the other direction we know that we have a local control country with regionality around state policy for education but in what ways can the federal government think about empowering accelerating supporting the great work that our states do and getting out of their way we just did a report on ai and data science education with ostp and the department of labor how did you see in the science education work the federal government could be supportive in the national policies they're allowed to enact not requirements but supportive policies to make the work go faster so um you're probably not going to like this answer i did everything i could to keep the federal government out of anything with science you might remember that when we were doing the science standards there was this little kerfuffle going on around math and english called common core um i wasn't going to say their name but yeah and and so i mean i would beg the department do not say the word science i mean i mean i literally remember having a nightmare of watching of me watching the presidential debate and seeing the ngss brought up on the on a debate stage i mean it was and i guess that was one of the nice things you know it was nice to be the second group that walked through the minefield you know um i mean at the end of the day i don't regardless of politics i don't think states like being told what to do by the federal government and and look i i mean i as commissioner i was an equal opportunity offender i had my fights with with both administrations because if i thought they were wrong i told them sometimes more loudly than i needed to but you're seeing things like ies money yeah there are many people here who have received scaleup grants from the institute for education sciences you spoke about bringing industry partners to the table labor is a very good way so i'm not talking about like putting a flag in the ground or somehow enacting policies around the politics but using and leveraging their particular network i totally get it that what i was telling you is kind of the preamble yeah okay i i think that you've got to when you're taught i mean the thing is when you go in and you have cs for all on your business card and you're trying to get them and you're talking to them about industry partners they've looked at your card and said cs for all okay so you need to develop very deliberate messages of things that obviously support cs but don't necessarily make that the primary because because one good way to kill things in a lot of states is you know i mean look my number one job at ng for ngss was to make sure nobody said no right away i mean they said no later that's fine but you know i i wasn't but i didn't want them to dismiss it out of hand immediately so knowing full well what is in ice ies grants what are in uh i mean there are i mean snap grants you know have opportunity for upskilling adults in computer science um in fact a lot of people don't even realize if you write your your program the right way while you're up skilling those those uh adults snap grant will pay for meals for the students for their kids while they're getting trained i mean there's ways to do that so i think that the lever to pull is being fully aware of what's offered by the federal government in terms of funding and having a message is deliberate that allows the federal government to give options for use of that money but without having the federal government say you need to go do it for this reason does that make sense a lot yes and i think i love that advice and i think that's probably super useful for all of our state leaders too so thank you you're welcome so it looks like we're bringing the planet plane in for a landing and i have one more question to close with and you were worried we didn't have enough questions great participation on a friday right all right so let's talk about gender parity currently women obtain more than half of u.s undergraduate degrees in biology 60 chemistry and mathematics yet only earn about 20 percent of computer science undergraduate degrees the gender parity in biochem and mathematics wasn't the case just a couple of days decades ago what do you think this is why do you think this is and what changed in k12 to help us usher these changes and what can we learn from that movement for cs so it's a i think there's a lot of there's a couple reasons there's some that maybe would be more valid in terms of research and then there are some that i just think um i think that we have seen especially more females in the areas of biology chemistry and physics because those have been promoted better the part that's probably less rooted in in research is the people who are usually the decision makers in college are biology chemistry and physics people um you know a lot of your provosts are physicists uh you've got a lot of that but also it's what gets taught in school so earth science is still not taught in high school you know why would it be i mean you know we only live here um you know but but for the most part we we finished teaching um earth science in eighth grade well you know i think the same parallel could be made with computer science if if there's not an attention to it in k12 um we're not going to be able to feed the pipeline into more people taking those courses and subsequently becoming employed um so you know i mean and and i think it's just i mean we were laughing about this earlier you know if you watch the big bang theory they make fun of the poor earth science guy all the time and and unfortunately it's kind of it's satirical i mean it is there's some truth to that now the people that are they're doing chemistry physics and biology are great people too don't get me wrong i got a really good friend back there somewhere gay that's a great physicist um but i do think that when we start to shortchange students um uh experience in k12 there's no way to think that they're going to get to college and just somehow miraculously find this so things like earth and things specifically like computer science we've got to do a better job of and i think we've done that with biology chemistry and physics and that's and and i think we've worked to lift the stigma of that girls can't do science but when you define science as only biology chemistry and physics that's where we see the increase well i think we've come to our time to end the session so can you please join me in thanking stephen for being with us today well i'll say one last thing you know if we don't get our act together then all the opportunity we have will just go up in flames [Laughter] well here you go thank you so much thank you i'll give you honey thank you thank you guys thanks pat well that's exactly what i uh was hoping that we'd get folks um i've been following uh what stephen pruitt has been doing for many years now i remember when actually some of the advocates in this room uh were reaching out to the science community during the time of the development of the framework and the ngss we're wondering hey where does computer science fit in folks and what we heard back and you know stephen would say this as well in fact he might have already mentioned it that they were kind of handcuffed by the framework given to them in the development of the standards and then he did allude to certain things that were included things like computational thinking computer modeling etc what i hope to understand from stephen was how we can learn lessons from the science movement even though the you know the science world is still struggling to include signs in all elementary schools but how we can learn from them rather than just repeat maybe the same mistakes so again thank you jackie thank you steven let's give them another round of applause if i can get the slides showing please so i wanted to uh be open with you guys about something i taught computer science at the high school level actually i was a high school computer science teacher as well and then i switched to computer science taught computer science for a number of years now i've been at code.org for eight and a half nine years now so probably been in the computer science game for 15 to 20 years now and much of the conversation has been around the capacity of the system now we have about 33 states with computer science state supervisors when just five years ago it was basically a couple people in anthony owen um and now even arkansas has like eight to ten uh state specialists focused on computer science but we've been talking about capacity for a long time we've been talking about just access for a long time like just just getting it on the menu and steve talked about that just just schools just put it on the menu kids will take it and we're seeing that we've been talking about participation how can we just get you know representational participation i'm so eager so eager one day that the discussion around computer science will be about the experience that kids are having now i know that we do i know that we do talk about that and there is some research around that experience but i i look for i look forward to the day when the majority of the conversation is around the experience that all of our students are having that cs4 is not about necessarily just all schools offering it or all students represented but all students having an amazing time and learning a lot and doing something with it so i know we're on the the edge of that now folks and that's why the state of cs report was all about accelerating action we're there we are really close there are states right now that are basically our lighthouse states our successes they're still early on but you know what we're at a point where we can really say doing this or doing that really does change the game right now they're you know i think nationally the the percent of women in computer sciences in at the high school level is something like 30ish percent maybe i mean that's still far away from the 50 percent we're looking for but there are states where it's like 46 48 at the high school level that's amazing so this can be done and i look forward to the time when all of us are gathering together maybe next year maybe the next year after that and much of our conversations around the experience of students so how do we get there well like i told you before when i uh was talking on uh wednesday this cut this conference has been designed around engagement and interaction and i so appreciate jackie calling you up to ask questions during the presentation during the uh during the conversation in the same way we've set aside time for you all to have strategy sessions from 10 30 to 11 30. now if you don't have a date or a plan during that time after i finish talking i want you to make a plan some of you are from california say woo a lot of you all are from california right you're going to have a specific state session just for california following this uh presentation during this time if you're not from california you can go to your regional room and have a conversation around a table or two and just bring people together uh alternatively maybe there aren't that actually many people from your state here and maybe you just want to meet with people from another state because you heard about their successes and you just want to replicate them you want to ask questions you want to you know learn the lessons that they learned and not make the same missteps maybe that uh they share so you can meet with another state in that regional room you can also meet with a speaker or other cs edcon participant remember you have a a link to everyone who agreed to share their contact information that was emailed to you this monday it's towards the bottom of the email in case you missed it and feel free to reach out to those folks and just ask them hey can i you know while we're here at the conference can we just talk about x y or z maybe there was a speaker that you just wanted to talk a little bit uh more to and uh you could also meet with a code.org regional partner code or regional partners if you could stand up so these are these regional organizations are doing a lot of the legwork the groundwork in their regions if you're a district in their region certainly you can talk to them to find out more about what they're doing in the region to support you uh additionally you can meet with some of the state cs supervisors i mentioned them if they could stand up we can give them a round of applause you could also meet up with some of your state computer science supervisors to understand what's happening statewide and be part of the statewide movement lastly feedback uh imagine that that y is next to the e uh so go ahead and take out your your computing device your uh your your phone or your laptop or your tablet do you know why cs edcon is the way it is this year we did a number of things different compared to 2019. for example rather than state networking we did regional networking rather than just one reception we included a happy hour as well you know we do these things based off of feedback so if you at any moment during this conference thought you know what they could have probably done this or that better unfortunately i can't read minds so please type in this link bit.li cs edcon 2021 survey it probably takes about five minutes four to five minutes sorry gotcha jackie will take care of it yeah and hopefully that link is not to the actual uh the editable form it's to the the view form it says view okay you know sometimes when you uh do these forms they have that default where it's like locked to just the organizational users yeah anyway um thank you for trying you'll you'll just refresh when jackie gives me the thumbs up yeah it's working now oh jackie thank you um yeah go ahead and refresh again we really appreciate your feedback we do intend on doing cs edcon again and so we want to use your feedback to make it even better for you did you like the whole concierge experience where folks like emailed you and tried to connect you with other people do you want more of that do you do you like the food did you not like the food do you wish there was this do you wish there was that uh do we do you wish that a certain topic was was covered go ahead and uh provide that feedback again we're going to use it again thank you on behalf of the conference team we're going to be moving to strategy sessions now uh starting at 10 30 to 11 30 and 11 30 we'll be back here for just some quick words and um and lunch if you do have to leave early at 11 30 and you can't just sit through lunch we're actually gonna have some box lunches that you can just grab and take on the way to the airport that was based off of feedback as well so again thank you on behalf of the conference team my name is pat my email is patco.org you can always personally email me as well um you are dismissed thank you one two three you
