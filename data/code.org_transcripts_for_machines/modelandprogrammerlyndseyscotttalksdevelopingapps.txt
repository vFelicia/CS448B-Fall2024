I have two apps currently in the App Store there's educate it's an app for sponsoring Uganda news and there's Al also iort an app for models and actors and other uh artists to show off their portfolios how does it work uh well it allows the user to have a customized portfolio you can customize the table you can customize the book and you can edit the images in your portfolio so that you can have multiple portfolios and and show multiple portfolios for different castings how do you make money there is some advertising and there's also um an an inapp upgrade for $4.99 you know what I want to know is how do you reconcile M the obvious difference between the two things that you do with your life on the one hand as a model you're an object right and on the other you're clearly somebody who's got some brain power who puts it to use developing apps as a model I've never felt like an object there's an artistic aspect to what I do uh you you put on these different outfits you become these different characters and you try to convey these different emotions and there's a creativity involved in that that's similar to the creativity that's involved when I'm making my apps matchmaker is your next project as I sit here across from you I think the last thing on Earth you need is a Matchmaker tell us out I don't know where your sources are but I I I like them a lot if they think that I'm I don't need this product uh it's hard being in New York and going out and meeting people who are like you it's very difficult so with the Matchmaker hang on a second a model like you re truly honestly you're having a hard time meeting somebody who's like yourself now I'm sure you're not looking for a male model who happens to be a computer geek in his spare time but mean really you're developing this app Matchmaker out of a sense of partly out of a sense of personal frustration when it's not easy in general but it's not just for love it's also for friendship and also for business so say you're at a bar or a business mixer or even just walking down the street you set your match criteria your profile information and your search radius and it will notify you when there are matches who are compatible with you in your IM mediate area how's that different from Tinder um for one it's more targeted and it'll notify you when there's someone in your vicinity so it it checks your personality and it checks the other people's personality in your area and it'll notify you specifically when this person is someone that you should be talking to so basically it's a way to promote real life social networking and prevent misconnections from happening it seemed like it would take an extraordinary amount of coding to create this app what went into it um I I'm very focused when I could so it took me only two months for this first version to do this particular app it relied heavily on some of iOS 7's new capabilities uh and so I had to research what io7 was capable of and incorporate that into my app I needed to put together a proximity algorithm I needed to put together a compatibility algorithm and I needed to um have a backend server to help support all this did you do all the coding yourself yes why is it that you think there aren't enough women coding we watch Rush masani and her girls who code initiative code academy is trying to attract women why don't more women want to Cod I think in general in our country we have a major issue of making computer science accessible in the first place it's only taught in one out of every 10 high schools right now and computer programming is actually it really is a lot of fun and I challenge anyone who doesn't think that it's fun to try code.org hour of code and they have a drag and drop interface which will allow you to basically make your own program it's super important right now computer science jobs are growing twice as fast as the average job in our country and the fact that we have so few women and people of color involved it's a huge detriment to our society
