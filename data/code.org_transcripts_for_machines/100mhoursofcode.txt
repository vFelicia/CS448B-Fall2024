Okay, now you're gonna to press run. Next week millions of students across the country will try their hand at an hour of computer programming. The WHOLE school will be doing an Hour of Code! Take an hour to learn more about the technology that touches every part of our lives. Computer science can unlock the best opportunities in the world, no matter where you are. If you can change technology, you can change the world. We've seen tens of millions of kids learn how to code. I'm so excited that all of you are participating in the Hour of Code. On it's face, it looks like it's this daunting, scary thing that you don't know how to do. But it can be learned. The Hour of Code isn't just about one hour of one week, organizers are hoping it has a more lasting effect by motivating schools to change what they teach in computer classes. So your traditional computer class that teaches you just how to use technology is increasingly irrelevant. Computer programming, computer science, and how to create technology, that's what we need to be teaching our kids. In 2014 alone, 60 million students tried the Hour of Code 1 in 3 U.S. students have tried the Hour of Code Over 1 million girls and over 1 million African American and Hispanic students enrolled in Code Studio courses Your generous support helped make the Hour of Code possible Thank you for supporting Code.org!
