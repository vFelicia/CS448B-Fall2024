(Brina Lee Instagram Engineer) A function is pretty much a sequence of instructions to perform a specific task. Basically if you're building a car, what you want the car to do is what a function is. Turn right, you want to turn left, you want it to drive, you want it to stop. All those could be functions. Now that we're back with our farmer, we're going to start learning how to define functions. You'll notice in your workspace that there's a block that has a star in the corner. This is a function definition. At the top line of the block it tells us the name of the function. The blocks inside of it tell us what it does. This definition sits in the workspace, but our farmer won't do the actions inside the function, until we drag out the function block. To do that, we need to click on the functions category in the menu and drag out the "fill 5" function. Let's put the fun back into functions!
