so a loop is a repetition of activity so going into a hive to inspect I look at a frame and then I put it back and so I repeat that same activity multiple time so it's looping around doing the same activity multiple times this is the repeat block whatever you put inside this block will repeat those actions the number of times that you tell it to for example and this level rather than drag out move forward and get nectar three times we're going to just drag them out once each and repeat the action three times that made it easy
