importantly our youth of color around culturally relevant engagement thank you sabine before i do my introductions i would also like to take a moment to recognize the indigenous and native presence here in austin texas here we are on the land of the tribes of humanos tonkawa liban apache kuala tekken and the komachi tribes i would now like to introduce my comoderator our last panelist in ceo my copanelist dr sabine thomas is a naturopathic physician and an infant and early childhood mental health practitioner with degrees from mount holyoke college bestiary university and a tenure from ada developers academy she blends her skills in community engagement user experience socioemotional learning to support parent engagement and teacher recruitment around computer science education in the northwest region our final panelist dr brown is a professor of teacher education at stanford university and author of the book science in the city cultural relevant stem education his research explores the relationship between student identity classroom culture and academic achievement in science education he focuses on the social connotations and cultural politics of science in the classroom as well as how teacher and student interactions serve to shape learning opportunities dr brown's work in science education in urban communities focuses on developing collaborative curricular cycles and classroom pedagogy and dr brown's recent work explores how race language and cultural impacts students learning in urban science classrooms lastly i would like to introduce our code.org ceo heidi petrovi who will then share his welcome address heidi is a tech entrepreneur and investor born in iran heidi grew up during the iraniraq war he did not his school did not offer computer science classes so he taught himself to code at home on a commodore 64. after immigrating to the united states he spent his summers working as a software engineer to help pay his way through high school and college heidi graduated from harvard university with a master's degree in computer science and pursued a career in technology starting at microsoft before creating code.org in 2016. today hottie leads a team of nearly 100 members to ensure access to computer science by every student welcome hottie thank you so much good morning i'm going to keep my comments really short so we can get into the panel on behalf of code.org i want to extend a warm welcome to our panelists trish rashad and dr brown at the current representation of black students and black teachers in k12 computer science although it's been steadily growing for the last eight years is still far from balanced and the gap is there not only because of the unequal access to computer science courses but also because the challenges of recruiting and retaining students and talent in the field of computer science at code.org we're committed to ensuring access to computer science to all students with a special focus on closing gaps and broadening participation among unrepresented youth as we hopefully and i'm going to knock on wood as we hopefully start closing the chapter on this terrible pandemic we all recognize that the pandemic has widened the digital divide among marginalized populations making this work more important than ever and so if you think about what school year 2022 is going to look like what could we do to not only make back the ground that we lost from the pandemic but then do more to even close gaps we're so delighted to have you here with us i'm eager to hear more about your insight on this important topic so once again welcome to our panel and thank you leoland and sabine and i'll let you all take it off from here thank you so much hattie for your welcome and panelists like we said before thank you all so much for being here as sabine has said the aim of this first panel is to continue to explore the why for recruiting black students and teachers into computer science education so recently our chief academic officer shared a gallup study stating that 78 of black parents and guardians agree that learning computer science is important however our data also shows black students who represent 15 percent of the national student demographics account for only 5 percent of those taking the ap computer science exam these numbers are important place to start and display the reality of the representation of black students in high school cs education parents are clearly curious and engaged but this interest is not reflected in the numbers of students moving forward with ap computer science so trish we'll start with you can you start us off and share why we should be concerned about this disparity shared in these numbers and how has this impacted your mission at taft well yeah i think we should care about it i think the the important thing though is for us to realize that our public school systems were never built for black students and so we are trying to fit black students into a structure that was not designed for them period so when you look at schools that offer ap classes it's hard to get students black students into ap computer science right i mean ap world government and english and all those things so we certainly are not going to get them into ap computer science because they already know that those classes are not meant for them so but when you look at a school that's majority of students of color they don't even have that array of classes so it's about availability when i look at the work we do what we focus on mostly is around giving kids those core stem skills that they need um critical thinking problem solving being able to ideate communicate um and uh create community for whatever it is they do and the way we introduce computer science is um is through projects so we're a projectbased learning model and so all of our students so it's not if you want to it's all of our students take those classes right that's one of the the issues that we have we have some classes for some kids and some from other for others in our traditional public schools and the way we get around it is saying that this is a requirement for everybody and if you actually like programming after you've taken it through your math class if you actually like it then we provide a mechanism for you to even explore it further but the whole goal is to get everybody's feet wet in it and not make it an option dr brown our brother's brother feel free to jump in as well i'm happy to to to add to that idea and i i want to point to the infrastructure meaning what are we really talented at the us is leading the world in basketball the u.s is leading the world in football you can find someone to teach you how to play basketball there's a basketball court in every school a ball available at any time if i'm interested in learning about code if i'm fortunate enough that my school offers something i need a computer that has the access to engage and i need the expert so we're suffering from real infrastructure so let's start at one level we need the teachers and i'm not talking about the teachers in school because we have an irrational expectation that an elementary school teacher who's teaching because they love kids is now going to be a expert at science math history english and oh by the way let's add computer science yeah we need to train an infrastructure that gives us a wealth of computer science educators now here's let's live in the real world if i know cs and i can code i can go make 60 000 as a as a teacher or i can make 150 working for some company or well beyond that right so what's the incentive to to embed a structure that provides students access this is the last thing i'll say we have an opportunity in front of us um those of you have children like i had children um the way that our work system is structured is we're working until 5 30. our kids get out of school at 3 15. so you tell me what are we doing between the hours of 3 15 and when parents are available to to to pick their kids up you know there's an entire opportunity there in between those hours to embed after school structures that really empower young people to learn and learn early but it requires us to teach the teachers and dr brown man you you hit right on the head i was just gonna add my um my way of engagement and what i've seen in the schools as well i remember being in a particular school in washington state and walking through and having to go and um give information around the college that i work for and when i'm going into these classrooms i'm seeing nothing but um our white and asian students and i see none of my black and brown students but in the lunchroom during lunch when i was there they're all around sitting around but they're not in that college going um classroom where i'm introducing what programs and so forth we have at the particular college at highline and and while while i'm in there i go and ask the teacher i said man where's my black and brown students at and and i asked her like did they get the invite as well and she tells me that you know she gave it to all the seniors the senior english classes that's who she invited so then i go back and i said well well you're telling me that there's no black and brown babies in the senior classes in english classes and then she actually shows me the report from her school and shows that none of those black and brown babies were in senior english classes none of them so i'm still thinking like men how else are we getting the information to our black and brown babies if they're not even in particular classes that are getting all this information pertaining to certain fields and certain programs so i go to the students and i asked him hey why are you not in senior classes senior english classes and one of them said this and it hurt my heart and they said well i don't need a foreign language and i said no no no no young man that has nothing to do with this like for you to even why are you even answering this question like this what why how does this answer come out and we still allow you to just pass through these quantities school without you knowing that you need senior english like this is so this is a tragedy that we're having right now in these schools and sister trish is right on you know we're we're trying to put a square in a circle you know that's just tough it wasn't meant for us in the first place so now we're trying to say please not just not integrate let's collaborate let's do that now and that's a whole different step that's that's a whole tear down and we build it together you know what i'm saying so now we're talking about collaboration right now we're talking about integrating and just helping us put some program in so we just got to be real with this this is going to be a tough uh the tough feat but you know i think it could be do it's doable and i i love your idea dr brown you're right i think we need to make our own institution mmhmm yeah you're not wrong are not wrong i mean we're trying to put a bandaid on the system that needs just to be torn down and rebuilt uh with the focus on on voice and choice of students all the students um right now it's just you know we put one bandaid in after another first it was math everybody needs to be better at math so let's bring in some google fancy online math programs like that's gonna make a difference right now we're talking about everybody needs computer science well what we're doing there is we're actually widening the gap national science foundation about six or seven years ago i was at a conference there and they were talking about how the previous 20 years of work to get more kids of color and more girls um into computer science actually widen the gap because people were afraid to talk about we are specifically targeting kids of color specifically underrepresented kids of color and so then they would just open up the programs they had to everybody and now who's going to come the same people who always come right because they're the ones who get the information first they're the ones who have the family structure and the income structure that can get them there first and so now we're widening the gap so this whole thing in washington state and i don't know if it's true anywhere else about this computer science for all is widening the gap because there's no money mandate behind that that says every single school needs to now have enough equipment um to brother brown's point enough equipment enough infrastructure and all that to make it happen they're just saying make it happen i didn't sign on to that you know i mean that's just crazy we need to think of a better way to do that to add to that i think we need to kind of in the spirit of wisdom look backwards to say well if people are thriving in new industries where are africanamericans thriving in industries that are emerging so if i take engineering and say well where are those who are getting the most degrees in engineering coming from well that answer north carolina's a t university historically black college and university so it's not that they have some secrets off the question is what is happening in that institution that's producing these outcomes if i go to look at biomedical research um the leading institution right now and graduating phds or seeing posds one of those is the university of maryland baltimore county where freeman hebrowski has created a specific program to empower the students and here's one thing that they that they share in common this is part of what my research works on is if i'm at north carolina a t and i'm in a classroom and i'm learning code i am not questioning whether or not i should be here whether or not people like myself are involved in the the uh in the coding community and why that's important is the psychology of performance there are studies that say if i have doubt about who i am and i encounter something that's difficult i'll then say you know what i shouldn't be here if i have a history that says i i'm not supposed to be part of this group but the inverse is if i'm no i'm supposed to be part of the group it's just difficult and i will get through it because i will get through it so the question is when you think about building a generation of computer scientists where are those schools that say all right we're going to focus on computer science and give early access to african americans and understand understandably saying let's focus on getting them teachers who look like them let's make sure we have access to computers unless do often do well meaning this it's not complicated any skill that is mastered is one that is practiced every day for years at a time so we're over complicating it by trying to change an infrastructure well we don't need permissions to take over one institution one school and we need to look historically at where that success was found and it is found in institutions where the identity politics are reduced because we affirm who people are and this crosses gender if you want to look at women physicists the majority of them at large volumes are coming from female only institutions and we need to look at that kind of focus and say how does this translate over to computer science i will offer a critique and here's a critique those in computer science have failed to even delve into the education research to find out what have educated educational researchers in schools done that works and let's translate this over to computer science go ahead i'll let you asking that's another question because that's not gonna be just about to be stuck for me no go ahead go ahead because i had somebody go ahead go ahead go ahead really great um i will make a comment as you all are talking about um where students are coming from that are succeeding and the importance of seeing yourself in these roles i will share a story that i always tell when i'm on panels talking about my experience with computer science i went to university of illinois in urbanachampaign which is a wellknown uh engineering school and i won't say it with the year but i'll just say that was the year that those really cool mac computers that had the color on the back those big ones first and my mom i was a freshman my mom was like huh i think that computers are going to be a big thing you should maybe you should major in that and my first thing was like mom that's for white men i'm not i'm not doing that and went a whole different different pathways so it wasn't about me i knew i was smart i was at this great school but that little thing of i didn't see myself in that world and i made that quick decision to just not even not even think of going into it so thank you um dr brown you have started talking about it already so it kind of leads into our next question that we had what the conversation is happening already and specifically those um that data that we shared at the beginning how can we create the sense of urgency or what can we do um to help with teachers and getting teachers educated who may not be already in this field i'm not sure if you know but for code.org our pd are for teachers who have no experience in computer science so those are those teachers you're talking about how do we get them um set up for success well let me let me offer a paradigm redirection um i don't pretend to be normal in that sense that i think a paradigm has to shift and here's the paradigm i don't want a teacher to add it to the curriculum i don't want a school to add it to the curriculum i would love code.org to say you know what we're going to offer free computer science training from three to six from grades three to eight for every elementary school in the state of washington and when that works well we'll move to california and we'll move to texas like do it for them because the fiscal infrastructure of schools doesn't provide teachers with the opportunity to make a reasonable decision so think about it i don't know the data of a person who's who learns a coding language i do know people who learn coding languages as second jobs switching careers inevitably they have moved out of schools into the professional world of tech companies and this is a bay area phenomena so i love the idea of training the trainer but we need to rethink the paradigm all together because adding something to a school is adding an additional burden now going to the questions i'm trying to answer the question the question is how do we build this generation of teachers well we have to build an infrastructure that supports them because people teach because they love kids they don't love subject matters and i think that's where that's that is the thing that i think is lost often a person who loves kids is going to spend their career teaching and they may teach computer science because they think it's interesting but i don't think a person who who loves computer science will do that work so let me offer the other i'm a proponent that providing kids opportunities to be producers will change the paradigm right so the minute kids shift their their thought from saying hey i'm a consumer of technology too i get to produce my own i think then you'll see a huge shift and we're seeing it now kids making their own games their own websites their own businesses i'm actually more encouraged than i am discouraged about how africanamericans are engaging in computer science and and let me add to that because you know um dr brown you make a good point you said something earlier around athletes and how we're entertainers and so forth and you know i read this interesting um statistic around black folk um in america taking up maybe i don't want to i don't know the percentage but i know it's a high percentage of social services jobs like a lot of our kids do see us doing social service jobs always trying to help somewhere around that line so you know i i continue to to to ponder and just think that you know you could you continue to see those type of positions and you see us in the way that we come in those positions oftentimes is almost like you know sluggish you know not wanting to do it either you know we we we're trying to get them go to another position that we don't see ourselves in you know so if i don't see nobody who is in cs programming or don't know how am i trying to put somebody to tell them they should go do this as well especially if they're seeing you more often than than anybody else that you're you wanted them to go and be so i would take it as far as saying that some of our coaches a lot of our coaches we need to expand our athletic scope and we need to span the holistic scope of that athlete and start to include some of these things inside these practices even if it's not a true practice may be included on a day that you work with your student athlete and let them know the importance of expanding their scope of wanting to be and and the skill set that they have to be successful in fields like this so i think that there's multiple ways that we can go at this and i think there's different agents that can play a part of it and i think that it will work if we just start to expand the way we present this information to our young people and let them know that this is a possible field for you to go into and most of my outreach skill sets and the strategies that i use you know it comes from edward nichols and he talks about the philosophical aspects of cultural differences and he talks about how we as black and brown folk we need to see images we need to see some type of there needs to be a rhythm with what you're giving me there needs to be something that i i can fill it inside i can see it i can feel it it represents me and not only do i see it that one time but i see it quite often so it needs to be something that's repetitive and it needs to be consistent so that's where i became successful in the way that i do my outreach with young people so i'm always trying to present them new information and i keep trying to bring people in and let them see people that look like them who are in these fields so it's important that we just expand the way that we already are connected with our young people through all the other social social services that we have created or we are part of and start to infiltrate it by saying you know what let's bring in some other people from the community that are in these other programs and show these babies that this is something else that you can do besides this right here and i think you do that at school early right i mean i'm gonna go back to our kids spend six and a half hours a day in school and all these other this is the reason why taft moved from the outofschool space to being a school because in the out of school space you can only help the kids that can get there and that's great but you get to all the kids if you change their school environment and that's our whole focus is getting kids hands on early building up their confidence early bringing in people who look like them to work with them get them used to working with adults it starts in kindergarten and then as you work up and you get older and you have opportunity to do job shadows and internships it just becomes a part of what you do what we're talking about right now is something completely separate we're talking about computer science as if it's its own entity but you've got if you're going to make change in the school environment you actually have to change the environment so you know what we do because we don't have teachers who can teach computer science at the high school level we merge it in with math and we have a partnership we used to be with microsoft nails with amazon in our teacher scientist partnership program and they come in and they teach and they show the teacher what needs to happen when they're not there so the kids can continue moving on and it's in context of a project so now i'm interested in coding because i have an end goal that's tied to my grade right but i also have a project that i helped define and i'm interested in yeah you take that and then um for our younger kids it's more of a an elective or um just experiential learning and it's a little smaller scale but they're still working with external people that way we're not having the number one add a whole nother class that not everybody can go to right and and we we don't segregate kids so we're not adding another class we're not trying to um retrain teachers or anything like that we're bringing the experts in who know how to do this and who also want to teach so they get paid their big old salary from their company and then they volunteer their time with us and you know that's something that could be scalable um is scalable because we do it in seven schools right now um but we all i don't want us to lose the fact that the school structure is what's killing us here and then the other side is the corporate structure because nobody ever really talks to them about creating an environment where i feel welcome as a black woman programmer right it's always about pipeline pipeline pipeline well i can get to your company and if i feel like the environment is not welcoming to me i'm going to leave come on i have personally counseled a number of mostly black men who were trying to leave industry and i'm trying to get them they're young trying to get them to stay to make enough money so that they can come out and volunteer or maybe work in a nonprofit or something but they can at least have that experience but look i don't care how many people of color you get i don't care how many black computer scientists you get it's never going to be a critical mass enough for them to feel like they are welcome in whatever company they work for so i think the onus needs to be put on these companies and you know maybe the big companies like microsoft amazon facebook they may be too big to change but all of those companies have people who have startups and what do they do they hire the same people who look like them who they're comfortable with and then all of a sudden somebody calls them on diversity it's like oh we never thought i needed to hire somebody right now that's always the excuse i needed to hire somebody right yeah so i went with you i'm gonna fall for that crap otherwise don't even say you care about that for real you're about people look all stop lying yes right i'm gonna jump trish i'm gonna jump in and i can't thank you enough because i'm just like leolan way back when my first computer science class at mount holyoke college way back when when we still had those the max that new holland described yes yes it is a women's college therefore there was immense representation around the presence of women in that computer science class but as i look to the right and to the left vivid i was the only one that looked like me certainly the only one that also sounded like me and so representation is is incredibly important and so until we are able to um replicate and i hope this happens very soon an opportunity to replicate institution lacked half um what what arguments can continue to be made and you've made several and i'm curious if we can expand on those um until we are able to get to this incredible representation where arguments can be made in favor of focus recruitment for black teachers in cs education this is the first part of my question what focused arguments can be made around recruiting black students in cs and also for the purpose of leoland and i including our team here at code.org which one should we focus on first recruitment focused recruitment of black teachers focus recruitment of black students in computer science education yeah i really am that those are bandaids right now so um when i think about washington state we don't even have enough money you're talking about bringing in computer science teachers um we don't even have enough money to do a portion of the things that we should be doing as a state there are a lot of mandates with no funding right we got mandates on class size we got mandates on you know where there isn't one on bringing in teachers of color there needs to be one right so the teaching industry is just as bad or the education industry is just as bad in terms of recruitment um taff runs the martinez fellowship program where we bring bring teachers of color into washington state we don't really is we're not we're pretty agnostic in terms of what they teach we want them in our classrooms but it's really difficult because now you have the issue of teachers of color not feeling welcome in their own day up on school because they're one of one two or three and now they're new teachers right coming into the space and um of course new teacher regardless of your race the the experienced teachers are going to poohpooh any idea you have because they got a kind of comfy and cushy there and they don't want you rocking the boat they certainly don't want you rocking the boat if you're black right and then what they're going to do is send you all the black kids that they don't want to deal with because under the guise that you can relate to them right they never cared about that before but now that you're there you can relay to them and so now you're a new teacher you got your own responsibilities you got all these kids that you know you're not going to abandon because you're going to love them right and now you're you're saddled with a black tax you can no longer just be a teacher you got to be all things to black kids right you got to be all things sometimes to all the kids of color and you got to do your job so bringing in teachers is not enough again the environment you got to change the environment that they're coming into regardless of whether you're talking about teachers of computer science or or engineers and computer scientists in their field the environments are not made for us and it's very discouraging they're they're very discouraging too um um sister tradition you look at how they do our babies they they either put them in iss they label them with some type of um behavior disruptive um issue a problem and so they don't even like the school setting and let me just tell you a story about my own son you know my son was almost diagnosed with some adhd where the teacher is not even a clinician to even do something like that but wanted to tell me and my wife that my son had an issue because he wanted to stand up at his desk to do his work so i tell her move the desk of the corner so then if he stands up he ain't bumping nobody he's doing his work still just adjust yourself a little bit so did i ask her again i said and give me your one reason give me your biggest issue that you have in my son that you showing me that he has some type of adhd behavior problem and she tells me that one day she asked him to go to recess and he gets up very quickly without grabbing his coat and just runs to the front of the line i said you better not put down in your notes you better not that is that's that is crazy that you have the opportunity to do that so why do i say all that and i had to also advocate for my son let me just tell you this how to advocate for my son and i had to hold him back a year get him back into an environment where he was getting encouraged to go to school and then put him back into the school system where now he's thriving because he's now encouraged to stay in school and want to be in school so you are so right sister trish around what these schools are doing to our kids mentally it is discouraging for them to even want to be in that building so when you talk about recruiting our black teachers and getting our black students dire my environment is so toxic that you first had to adjust whatever places these babies are learning from that has to be straightened up that has to be fixed there's no way that you're going to put the our black and brown babies in this environment and think that just because you put a black teacher in there that's gonna be all good and you're right such a trish i go into these schools they send me right to the iss right to the iss for shot go talk to these babies or rashad we got men do you want a mentor or should i go talk to these babies and they're all in iss they're just sitting there and those teachers who are those individuals who are sitting at iss they're not even teachers or para educators there are people who are just coming in saying that i need a job so let me just make sure that i can sit here watch over our babies and at the same time they could be finished share their credentials to be a teacher yeah and so can you expand on iss just for the audience that's the end school suspension that's a black room it's it's just it's the prison it's a schooltoprison complex that's the that is the gate keeper of putting our babies inside that prison to school um um complex because those rooms i'm gonna tell you right now most of them don't have no windows the the curtains usually are closed it's very dark it's not it's it's it's not even a classroom setup it's it's very it's it's very discouraging for a student to know that they're in a room where they're not even learning any content to get themselves ahead but they're sitting there because their behavior that's what that is so it's very discouraging for us to think that our babies are in environments where they want to learn that there's some type of programming and they could get into and not even be in a proper classes to even get themselves to be in such a program like we're talking about right now and behavioral classrooms are pretty much the same as well that's under the guise of special ed yep that's exactly what it is yeah so i know we sound discouraging i'm sorry but you know we don't sound truthful we just disagree we sound truthful but i know they want to come out with something but here's the thing 90 of teachers in our public schools are white i don't know how many people know that and out of that 90 i would say probably 85 percent of them are women right we lost all our black teachers and yeah because they were not allowed to have jobs in the integrated schools and so we've been working hard as a society to get it back and then you got the other side that says and this was a personal challenge for me when we started tap is you know i know we need black teachers but i'm trying to get you ready for a tech job right and how can i tell you to go be a teacher when i know you can make generational changes within your family and your community by getting a job in computer science and then i'm also sending you to the wolves because i know they don't want you right so it's like god you know but but you keep doing it and i don't know what the role is for code.org in terms of changing um you know changing what you want you want to get more black teachers you want to get more black students um into computer science but it's the infrastructure has got to change it really does and until that changes you're going to be you'll have success here success there you know maybe find a school that has um already has a high percentage of black teachers and see if you can wrap code.org stuff around that school and what the possibilities are but but um there is no no nationwide strategy to do that kind of thing and honestly i don't know if we need to be scaling like that right it's like we need more depth than breath and so this is going to go slower and i know you young people want to go fast but you know it it has to you've got to get depth and build relationships right now what's happening is very transactional and it doesn't last right and so you need to have those relationships that are deep with with teachers with students with families with community for change and people are finally starting to come around with that we used to get poohpoohed for that all the time right why don't you scale why don't you scale you can't cause learning you just can't so what we can do though is to really build a systemic structure so that people can maintain it without having to have tap there all the time right let's get people started let's build community together and that's what how we're going to win so we need to get away from those majority population methods and move more to what we're used to as a community can you expand a little bit on and i couldn't agree more with you and i will take and accept my my designation as a youth that's good all y'all i'm 63 years old all you all are babies come on now we'll take it okay thank you all right i'm i'm curious if you can um expand on the the importance of of steady desert right really the importance of being able to to create this this relationship locally originally and dr brown uh once trish is able to take it there i'd love for you to touch a little bit on what does this look like as you are yourself working and and and and essentially growing growing teachers how are you instilling quite a bit of what we're talking about here through your lenses as we're working with with teachers so trish take us to i'll just quickly summarize it's about building trust it really is you know one of the things i talk to people about particularly um uh young folks getting into leadership and all that is that you need to show up as yourself every time so that people know what to expect and it's the same thing when when you're partnering with schools and students and families they need to know what to expect they need to be able to trust right they already have been um marginalized so much and told so many lies and and so for us it's really important that um they know that their kids are our kids that they understand exactly what we're doing we're not hiding anything we're actually sharing with families what their kids are doing right that we we as an organization are majority people of color so that helps a lot right and so they know and most of us well it used to be not anymore but most of us came from washington state and from this area in particular right and so all those things together really build that trust and we stay with the kids until they understand it right it's not like for two weeks we're learning this if you don't know it we're sending you over here to the kids you know to remedial learning it's like however long it takes you yeah we're going to stay with you because you got to learn this standard and and your teammates will help you and every right so it's that whole community um so we shy away from that timeline of by the end of this school year you need to know these 20 things you know you might know 10 of them and i can see you're emerging on another 10. i'm not going to fail you right we we see you're growing right that's the kind of stuff i'm talking about all right it's not that quick um oh you failed your state test in third grade we're gonna change your entire life because of that one data point all right and we're not changing it for good yeah thank you thank you dr brown well you know along those same lines i think teaching is always about culture uh and and this actually addresses the the not the computer science world as well uh culture is not your idea of what people are but it's your decisions about people so dealing with the institutions the the businesses uh if you look at your leadership team uh you've made a decision just look at the pictures who is your senior leadership who's your hr department uh who's your recruitment team uh who are your middle managers just look at the pictures and that will tell you about the decisions you've made about culture and that speaks volumes far far louder than any diversity statement the hiring of a diversity inclusion officer your decisions are reflected the culture is reflected in your decisions so as a teacher right the decisions i'm making is what am i teaching and where does it live so for example we've tried to build out a culturally relevant curriculum uh in computer science and engineering so the question was what do i teach that the kids will take great pride in and it's not complicated we go ask the kids what are you interested in right what is the thing that you're you're most curious about and that's what we teach them the code yeah so quick examples and i'll move on is we had a group of elementary school kids who wanted to build a robot but here's what was interesting they wanted to build and program robots to carry groceries for the grandparents right so it was about the abuela the older kids were interested in gentrification so we were we were helping them build websites to tell the story of the city of oakland so tell me the the pride of your community so the thought is that the actual instruction sends a message it's a decision what do i value and so again i'll go back to the same point we don't teach anything you don't teach computer science you teach people you have to start understanding what they're interested in and that's where you're that's where the coding language should be taught and so that's the big thing is a real focus on culture students yeah yeah culture is big i i teach that you're you are totally correct um dr brown and and you know when i when i connect with my young my young people i'm always trying to bring in the history you know james baldwin you know someone that i look up to he said if you don't know what happened behind you you never understand what's happening around you so you have to bring in you know this this structural context to these babies so they can see it and they reach and they they receive it i i'm so amazed that when people think that oh some of this stuff can be boring no it's your delivery it's how you deliver the message uh how are you and how consistent are you with the message you know it's just not no black history i don't call black this is black excellence this is not history this is excellence all around you that you need to see on a daily basis so when you do when i do my outreach and engagement i'm always trying to bring the excellence regardless of what month it is so they can see that this is something that's yearround this is your history this is not this i mean this is your excellence beyond just your history this is you look what's around you that is part of you that you had no idea that you had no idea so it is it's been bringing me joy to be able to bring individuals such as yourself i've been working with sister tris she opened up path i was probably one of the first mentors that came into that school to meet with some of those students and really talk to them so and i i have nothing but the utmost respect for what she did and i still love that school what she's doing and so um you know the the outreach and engagement piece is very important we cannot go and recruit our babies we have to do engagement and outreach with them it's a big difference when you recruit you're going for numbers and then your your your mindset is set with that western civilization mindset where we're looking for numbers and measurements where you need to get to our way of interacting and engaging which is more relational so you have to go in wanting to engage you wanted to do our outreach true outreach i'm not trying to recruit you i'm trying to engage with you so that means that you have to bring in all types of different information that represents who they are so they can see it yes yes these are no i don't know well listen i and i we knew this would happen one hour is not enough it's not nearly enough um i will say this these these are we we are consistently rerethinking our outreach um not just leona not just myself but the entire outreach team rethinking outreach rethinking outreach with being with having incredible level of mindfulness um what i have gathered what recently have gathered collectively is dr brown talked to us really thinking about student empowerment psychology of performance trish you highlighted the importance of creating a structure that is welcoming that is grooming that is creating that foundations for students to see themselves in this curriculum and also specific around community engagement right growth steady slow um dr brown you also highlighted the importance of codesigning as we are bringing not only teachers but students engaging them into the process of what it means to be able to be part of this curriculum um brother rashad you definitely talk to us about thinking a little outside of the box so certainly we go into these um into computer science into tech what does it look like to bring it back to the community what does it look like to be able to think about access to those advanced classes how do we normalize and to certainly demystify what it looks like um and and culture you took us home dr brown in terms of rethinking what what culture looks like so i i certainly these are a few of many gems that you shared with us trish you are very right this is just the beginning we are appreciative of of your time being here with us and um aqua moderator leolain it's gone actually before we wrapped up i just wanted to give you all just um do have a couple more minutes if you if there's anything that you feel like you wanted the audience to hear that you haven't got a chance to say or we haven't asked um here's the perfect time we would love to hear anything else you all would like to close us out with um i would like to see everybody that says they care about black students and all students of color to actually go on a personal antiracism journey we don't need allies we need coconspirators and in order to be a coconspirator you need to also be antiracist so it's not enough to say i don't condone racism uh you got to take that next step further and it's going to be painful as hell and they're going to be some roadblocks but it will say a lot about whether you're true to it or not if you push through it and i always like i i like to end just saying that you know um we we come through this month of february we say black history but like again i like to say black excellence and a lot of dei work wouldn't even have started if it wasn't for our black plight or black injustices that happened then are in and continue to happen to our babies our black and brown babies in these schools so um just like such a trish you know she i like her as coconspirator i say accomplice you know i just say you know what help me build the whole plan and help me tear it down too so if i get caught you right behind me saying i helped them and so you know i don't want you to talk about some oh i knew i heard about the plan but no no no i don't want you hearing about i want you to say my hands was on it too and so i love it um but i'll just say that you know there's so many babies out here that we we cannot forget i work with incarcerated youth and this is the shirt that i represent today with them and i told them that i'm gonna give them a shout out and it stands for um making a difference every day made men and these young young fellows who are getting out of the prison incarcerated system and they're becoming part of our community again so even implement even introducing to this type of field is something that i'm i've i've been doing so this is good so i just want to give a shout out and then also say thank you to you for inviting me for this um this excellent panel with these esteemed guests with these doctors thank you so dr brown i see your twitter handle on your background um brother rashad and trish where can the folks find you on social they want to

just i'll watch the recording later so i really appreciate you all time um like sabine said an hour definitely isn't enough time to discuss this topic but hopefully the audience you were able to gain some knowledge and action steps that you can take back to your school districts and classrooms when we close the survey will pop up please take a couple of minutes to complete it as will provide us valuable feedback on this panel as well as help us to ensure that the next series of panels will be as valuable to you as this one is if you're a school or a teacher or school administrator and are interested in code.org computer science professional development applications are now open across the u.s and yes scholarships are available for teachers who meet the requirements please visit code.org apply for more information so this panel is a part of a series of panels on recruiting black students and teachers to computer science that we will be hosting throughout the next few months please follow us on twitter at code.org to stay up to date as these are scheduled thank you all so much again for watching and we'll see you soon byebye thank you take care everybody y'all be good be safe stay healthy thank you
