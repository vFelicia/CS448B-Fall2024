Hi everybody! Last year, students and teachers across our country celebrated Computer Science Education Week with an Hour of Code. They learned new skills, programmed games and apps, and realized that while no one is born a computer scientist, becoming a computer scientist isn't as scary as it sounds. With hard work, and a little math and science, anyone can do it. For this year's Computer Science Education Week, more than 48 million people have already participated, and we're hoping even more of you will get involved. Don't just consume things, create things. Take an hour to learn more about the technology that touches every part of our lives. That's how you can prepare yourself with the skills you need for your future. And that's how you can help prepare our country for the future as well. America has always been a nation of tinkerers, builders, and inventors. We brought the world everything from the lightbulb and the telephone, to the iPad and the Internet. So whether you're a young man trying his hand at programming for the first time or a young woman who is already hard at work on the next big thing, we're counting on youAmerica's young people, to keep us on the cutting edge. Thanks everybody, and happy coding!
