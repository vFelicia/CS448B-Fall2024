welcome to computer science connections coding a time capsule this module makes connections between social studies Ela and computer science specifically it can introduce reinforce or extend any student learning related to a specific historical event or time period if you're teaching about historical perspectives current events selfexpression or just want to get your students coding you've come to the right place in this module students will learn the basics of sprite lab a blockbased coding platform the main computer science Concepts in this module are Sprites and events a Sprite is something you interact with like a character in a game or an object in a scene Sprites can have different properties like its costume size and location en coding there are cause and effect relationships we trigger with events an event is an action that tells a specific chunk of code to run events allow us to change our programs in real time for example by assigning a spin right Behavior with a mouse click event we can command this hamburger to spin right when it's clicked there are four lessons in this module in lesson one students will learn the basics of sprite lab by coding the mood and imagery of a short poem written about a specific important Moment In Time students will set a background set text effects create Sprites with behaviors play sounds and Trigger events that correspond to certain lines of text notice this drop down menu of poems above the play Space we provide a unique poem for each level but students can also choose which poem they want to illustrate by picking one from the list or entering their own in this unplugged lesson students will plan and write their own time capsule poem about the world they live in today in lesson three students use their poem from the previous lesson to create their personalized Time Capsule poems they will use block codes to animate and enhance their projects in the final unplugged lesson students will present their project to the peers they will discuss the importance of curation and what elements are essential in retelling history this module is focused on finding the mood or tone shifts within a poem to illustrate those shifts students need to to code new effects to be triggered when a particular line shows on the screen however waiting for each line to animate just to check your code can be cumbersome we suggest you show students how to try out different effects under the win run event when a student is satisfied with their code they can drag that chunk of code under the corresponding win line shows event a student might encounter a bug if the sprite's costume selection are inconsistent have students double check that they've selected the correct costume to call the intended spray in this example the coder wants the Sprite with a girl costume to grow when line one shows however the coder mistakenly assigned the basketball Sprite to grow because there is no basketball Sprite in the play Space nothing will happen to debug change the basketball Sprite to the Sprite with a girl costume in this block if students struggle to enter their own poem model how to use the drop down above the play Space to select enter my own in every lesson plan discussion questions are coupled with discussion goals check for understanding and promote student Reflection by incorporating these discussion questions into your teaching review the concepts of mood and imagery with your students use the provided slides show to introduce these Concepts and teach the vocabulary within the context of the lesson explain to students that mood and imagery can be illustrated by the code students write students can illustrate mood with visual effects this module is aligned with the college career and Civic life framework common core Ela standards and the computer science Teachers Association standards in order to align to the concepts you already teach to help you think of ways to integrate ask yourself how might this module support the content I'm already teaching and should I use this module to introduce reinforce or extend student learning on this topic don't forget about the hide and show feature for each lesson it's best practice to only show the lesson students are currently working on if you do not hide the following lessons students will be moved on to the next lesson automatically before teaching this module try the lessons and review the lesson plans and additional resources code.org provides resources like slides student handouts and helpful hints to help you and your students get started
