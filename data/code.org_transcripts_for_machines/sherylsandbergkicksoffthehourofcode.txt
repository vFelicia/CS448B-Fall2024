about 12 years ago I was looking for a job and I was looking at what I thought mattered in the world and what I really think matters in the world in so many ways is our ability to communicate when you build technology you can build something and put it out there and so many people around the world can use it and use it at the same time and that makes our world a little bit smaller in a way that I think no other Industries managed to do I think for a long time the world thought that some things were for boys and some things were for girls and everyone understands now that boys and girls can have equal opportunities when girls are given equal opportunity to study computer science they're just as good at coding at Building Products as boys are I did not learn to code when I was in school because I didn't have this opportunity really no one did which is why I'm so excited that all of you are participating in hour of code and getting exposure to computer science
