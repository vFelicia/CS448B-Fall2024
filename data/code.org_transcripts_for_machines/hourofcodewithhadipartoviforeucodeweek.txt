we can switch this way so we can see ourselves oh there i am hi there uh and we're here to kick off at one hour during eu code week of streaming to teach a little bit of uh coding and computer science to folks let me turn off our zoom background because it's distracting a little bit uh no background yay there we go all right um i wanted to ask everybody if you're uh joining us there's a number of ways you can chat with us but the most important one if you're not already familiar with it is the little chat button in the bottom of your screen if you see that there i'd love to see where people are calling in from so if you could chat and uh just type in the country or city that you're participating from so you can see where folks are we can see stuff you can you read some of these um songs from romania sounds from sweden greece germany abu dhabi denmark paris austria belgium portugal macedonia wow myanmar that's pretty far away croatia i've seen a lot of people from romania rhode island okay we have some folks from the united states even uh well folks are calling in from all over the place at an eu code week is one of the first weeks of the year where uh folks from all over the world in europe are basically participating in computer science uh sophie and i wanted to spend some time showing coding at to folks uh using the code.org platform you know the hour of code is one of the things that kicked off basically this idea of onehour introductions to computer science and since we started it uh eight years ago we've now had over one billion hours of code done before we jump into this i want to get a sense of what grade level folks are in that are coming in so if you could type in what grade you're in and a number from 1 through 12 for the folk for the students who are in school so we could get a sense of what grades everybody's in grade six one to six that's lots of grades elementary school one to seven one to eight one to eight it sounds like these are classrooms uh dialing in elementary thirteen to fifteen and i also wanna get a sense of how many of high school mainly all right so we have basically students from all all ages teenagers elementary school students we're going to have a program that is basically kind of targeting all ages but we're going to start at the easier stuff and then get progressively harder over time so if you're more advanced it may take a little bit of uh you may need to be a little bit patient with us and if you have questions at any point please type it into the chat room we have some folks from code.org will be able to respond at and if you have questions for us to answer you can also use uh you can basically raise your hand you see a button that looks like this to raise your hand to ask a question although the chat is probably the best way to do that all right so sophia are you ready yeah so sophia is going to be doing most of the coding during this uh except for the maybe the most advanced stuff but what we're going to first do is a little bit of coding with a tool called artist and what we're going to learn about is algorithms sophia what's an algorithm you're not sure an algorithm is when you give a computer a set of instructions or a series of steps to solve a problem of some sort oh i was thinking of something else oh you were confused about what an algorithm is all right well it's one of those words that we learn in computer science and sophia is going to make an algorithm to do some drawings so let's first share my screen can everybody see this i hope so what we're looking at right now is the code.org artist tool and sophia is going to use this but what we see over here is the little artist he's going to be making the drawings over here are the commands he can use and over here is where the code is going to be that we're going to create so she's going to basically use these commands to make some code so sophia can you start by getting the artist to move 100 pixels to the right and then hit run to see what that's going to do all right so the artist moved 100 pixels to draw a line that's not super incredible but it's a first start so next what we want to do is have the artist draw a shape so sophie can you have the artist turn right after his little move command and then move again and now hit run all right so can you drive so can you uh basically copy that basically multiple more turn and move commands so maybe three or four more as as she's doing this i want people to uh to basically type in the chat area what they think this is gonna do when she hits the run button next keep going one more move and one more turn all right so what do you all think this is going to draw so eric says it's going to be a square so if you say can you hit run and reset again all right that's the square that's pretty simple so one thing we want to do is show the repeat blocks so if you take out most of these except just to move forward and turn right if you look it says move turn move turn move turn move turn so instead of doing it that way we can just repeat it four times so four times we're going to repeat this move turn this does the same thing so if i type the number four here and you hit the reset it draws a simple square now let's make every square make the square a random color and repeat and draw many many many many squares so basically drag another repeat block and put put it up there and put the first one inside there and now repeat like a hundred times not three thousand one hundred one hundred times and now each time the square gets drawn make it a different color so before you draw the square set color to random color so now we're going to draw 100 squares hit the reset button and start it over again and you can make it faster if you want okay stop that's getting boring but what you're seeing right now is a very simple algorithm where we're basically using the repeat command telling it not only to draw a square but to repeatedly draw a square but all those squares are right on top of each other so what are what are the things we could do that we can make so we can see every one of those squares individually maybe we can put another turn command so after each square there's a little bit of a turn not 90 degrees yeah pick a smaller number like maybe now you can use that angle thing to turn just a little bit a tiny little turn yeah that's good 11 degrees okay now hit run and see what happens so after every square it's doing a turn and it's going to keep going because we said 11 degrees so it's going to do 100 different little squares each one slightly farther apart from the other so what's cool about this do you want to see truck do the same thing by using triangles instead of squares so instead of doing the if we want to change that from a square to a triangle remember when we said repeat four times move forward and 90 degrees change that to move three times and then turn it two and oops three times and then turn right by we should do 120. yeah let's make this a little more too here and you want to change the turn okay so you just play with the numbers and then you can click run and make a different shape and now these are triangles yeah the other thing we could do is make stickers so why don't we make a sticker all throughout this square so drag the draw sticker shape and put it into the middle of that square or the triangle that's going to do it at the end of each one yeah do it like many times inside the triangle yeah something like that and let's choose a sticker so can folks type in the chat what sticker they want what shape should we put in there we have like an alien ghost a wizard a wizard somebody chose zombie okay which one of these is the zombie i don't see the zombie there's the zombie can you pick the zombie so now every single time that's drawing it's also going to draw zombies all over the place so hit the run button let's see what happens oh there's a lot of zombies everywhere we've created a monster all right so this is a very simple algorithm we just made and that was basically zombie apocalypse and one thing i want to show is anytime you write code on code.org and we're using the code.org hour of code right here do this when you hit the finish button you can see your creation you can share it and you can also send it to your phone so there's a qr code that you can actually scan with your phone and if you have your phone camera ready you could basically use that if you want if you want it so i'm gonna use my phone camera to scan that and it'll actually then show me how to go and then i can then get the same zombie apocalypse the same zombie apocalypse is now on my phone so it's really easy to build something that you also then send to a phone and play with i have zombies all over my phone so moving on let's do something different i want to now teach something else in computer science we learned about algorithms let's turn about let's learn about events so events sophia do you want to explain what are events in computer science event is not really like a run command but it's something that it can be played many times if you press something like for example a one if you have the code under event every time you press one that code will run yep so an event is when the computer is reacting to something that happened so instead of you just giving it the commands to do over and over and over you can say when the mouse is clicked or when a key is pressed or when when somebody taps the screen or if there's a very loud sound when something happens you make something happen that you you react to it so we're going to do something involving events but using dancing we're going to have sophia is going to do some dancing for us and we're going to program her using events and the events are going to say when you see the letter a and when you see the letter b and when you see the letter c and sophia are you ready to do the dancing is that gonna be better finally ask the audience so they can decide who's gonna do the dancing so why don't you all decide by chatting who should do the dancing sofia or hottie or dad if you don't know how to stop me people are saying howdy howdy come on let's have some folks ask for sophia oh come on all right i'm gonna do the dance yeah well wait eula says sophia it sounds like it's a tie most no see most there's a bunch of people who said sophia should do this two out of like five okay fine i'll do it so sofia is gonna hold up different letters a b and c and we're going to have three different dance moves for when she holds the letters but we want to have the audience choose what the dance moves are so the first is when the a is showing what should the dance move be the choices are let's say a kick or a clap uh kick or clap yeah what should we do on the letter a kick or clap okay it sounds like people are saying clap right so we're going to make the first command be that when the a shows we're going to do a clap all right the next dance move is going to be when the b shows hold up your letter b when the b shows we can choose between a dab or a floss so can folks type in what would you like on the letter b floss okay floss is like a really hard move so if you don't make me do this too often all right and then lastly when the letter c shows uh we've done a clap in a floss shall we make the third one just be a dab yeah all right so we're gonna have here's our code when the a shows clap when the b shows floss and when the c shows dab all right i'm gonna get my code ready so i don't forget what these commands are and sophia is gonna and if you're watching at home and the students who are younger you can follow along with sophia yourselves to get up a little bit to get moving a bit um and sophia you hit this play button to start the music right is everybody ready and sophia is going to show the letters and i'm going to quickly do a is clap b as floss c is dab right you're so tall ready sofia yes go right so that was a little bit of exercise for me but what we're going to do next is show how you can actually do this on a computer using coding and sophia is going to do the coding this time yes sure okay so i'm gonna go into the code.org dance party so we're gonna share our screen again here's the code.org dance party and so let's do the same code that we were just doing uh but using i mean basically the same dance so that everybody helped us decide so why don't you first create a world and choose a world background should we ask our audience what background to use so choose from the different backgrounds should we do a firework or a laser dance floor um let's do the laser dance floor oh somebody said neon disco choose neon disco disco ball all right now put a dancer in the middle and you probably wanted to be a cat because you love cats okay well and you want to put some dancers in the all around it as well so make a group of dancers you can make it be a cat because i know you love cats and then make like 20 of something else 20 and let's ask the audience what we want this one to be so should these be dogs or ducks or pineapples or robots somebody said aliens let's go aliens okay aliens aliens is i think pretty popular all right um and then what do we want these these dancers are going to do different stuff when we hit the keys so see where it says events and that's what we were learning about is events so click choose when the up arrow key is pressed but instead of the up key click and choose the letter a and for letter a we're going to do a clap i don't remember what they are you'll need to look it up okay okay so now go into the dancers and make everybody do a clap and then choose you can say when the b letter is pressed what's the b again b is false yep okay i always mix these up okay last one and then the last one when a c is pressed and have it do dab forever all right so you're going to use the little keyboard to make the dance work and for the song we have this thing here the ode to code we could choose all sorts of songs here uh but because it's eu code week we have the ode to code song that's been written for eu code week all right are you ready for this and sophia you're gonna man the keyboard ready and so you're gonna do a b and c you want to shout out as you're doing hey and can you do it faster like um okay all right so we could do lots and lots of different things somebody said stop for a second it's laggy for me but there's all sorts of different dances you can make this much much more complicated with different key presses and different moves and then this too you can also once you've finished your dance you can also send it to your phone as well but i want to now switch gears and do something a lot more complicated we're going to actually make our own little app and this is also going to use events so we're jumping into code.org's app lab if you're in elementary school you'll still be able to follow along but the coding we're doing even though it's drag and drop is going to be in a programming language called javascript so maybe a little bit harder to follow along but then we're going to jump into something easy afterwards again so don't lose us um so the app that i want to make is an image tutorial you know in apps like instagram or snapchat if you take photos you can basically draw on your photo we want to make an app like that so you can draw uh we're gonna have you pick a photo that you draw on as well so um so we're gonna have you pick a photo from here we're gonna go so here's app lab and here you have we're gonna be able to design our app in design mode and then write the code for it so the first thing we wanna do is drag an image that is the image that our app is gonna have that's kind of important yes and for the image we're gonna choose a cat this cat which is sophia's cat and i didn't have sunny so this is our previous cat right so here's our little cat and we want to write the code so that sophia can doodle on this cat and draw all over it all right sophia are you ready yes so what we want to do is make it so that any time the mouse moves you're drawing so can you drag an on event block from over there and say on events that on the screen you see a mouse move event so on the screen when you get a mouse move event and then we want to move and draw to that location so go into the turtle drawing commands and say move to but instead of moving to zero zero we're going to move to event dot x and event dot y and that's the location that the mouse move event brought us to so now click run and then move around oops click run again oops we have an error hold on i need to put a little event here okay try it again and so the as you're moving the turtle is moving but it's not drawing anything so how do we get it to draw now we're doing something called debugging this is basically a bug that we found in our code that i drew yes sophia drew this little ladybug so hit the reset button so the problem is that the turtle isn't drawing at all because his pen isn't down so what we need to do is drag this pen down command to the very front and the very top of your code and while we're there let's check the pen color so make the pen color white yeah you can click there and choose the color for it oh no you can't i'll i'll type it in we'll make it a white pen and do you want to choose the pen width as well sure and we'll make that five okay now hit run so is it drawing i don't think so that dad i have perfectly good way i can see it's not dry it's not drying hmm do you need to do the pen color before no no this is correct i'm only wondering if it's not drawing on the image because it's drawing on the screen ahead of it i think we need to let's go to design mode and hit run again oh it is drawing all right so i'm just going to get rid of the cat so we write the code without the cat behind it okay so you're doing this image doodling so let me change this green color though so we'll we'll debug that later but for now all we're going to do is is continue doing this code so hit the run button one of the problems right now is as you're moving around can you stop the drawing i don't think no it's drawing all the time the reason is right now it's always the pen is down remember how we said pen down so we need to have the pen sometimes be down and sometimes be up maybe when you're clicking okay so hit reset we can use other events remember we're learning about events all right so click out go into ui controls and choose on event it's at the top on events so we want to figure out that when the mouse is down the pen should be down so in the screen gets a mouse down event then say pen down go to turtle pen down and also let's also make a move to command right here as well so we'll say move to and over here event dot x and events dot y what about the pen down at the top of the screen oh you don't want it to this one you mean yeah you want it to no longer start with the pen being down how should it start pin up let's start with the pen up okay so now what's this going to do hit run and see what happens yay so now it's not drawing until you click now can you stop wait it's not stopping the drawing stop the drawing you want to make a smiley face okay so you can't do it because now we did what we said when the mouse goes down but we didn't do anything when the mouse goes up so now go to ui controls and then say on event screen one thus up i think yep that's a good guess when the screen has a mouse up event what should we do you don't need that okay maybe and up yeah all right so now i think you have a full image doodler so now you can draw whatever you want lift the mouse up yay so do you want to add some more stuff to this image doodler to make it slightly more powerful okay stop let's let's add some stuff because this is kind of simplistic but the other thing is see this little triangle that's moving around with us that's the little turtle and we can have him hide so we don't see him as we're writing our code so basically there's a hide command to hide the turtle but what i want to do is add some buttons to basically let you choose the color so click design to move to the design mode and drag a few buttons to either the bottom of the top of the screen maybe three three buttons you're not gonna be perfect they don't need to be perfect okay move them around a little bit okay okay let's name these different buttons after different colors and let's ask the audience what colors should we use for the first button we can choose red green blue wow everybody's choosing red so red okay so the first button is red and we can even choose the color of this button to be red is that kind of reddish it's like an orange artist but it does it's close enough right what color should we make the next button blue green yellow blue what somebody said violet blue and green let's let's do the next two buttons blue and green so this one is going to be blue and then this one the text of it will make green and so if you want to help me choose green that's good all right that's good red blue and green are our buttons so how do we make the code so that depending on which button we press the color changes will be another event we need to use events that's right so go into ui controls again and then say on event and now we need to choose when the buttons are clicked so on event where the button is clicked which button i think button four how do you know just pick button four and then hover over them to see what they are that one's button four that one's button five thousand six so when button four is clicked what should we do go into the turtle again let me change the pen color yeah scroll down and see where it says pen color and it's already set to red okay and then now bring another ui event on event and instead of id you want to choose button five and then oh no that's that's correct okay and then you want to do a turtle command and choose the pen color blue click on the red you do all right and then last last one for green you're way ahead of me now there we go turtle no don't forget to choose the id for your button we still have the turtle issac called turtle by the way you always want to know why is it called turtle yeah that is a great question like python or something no python is internal or differently named by different people a long time ago there's a basically an mit turtle drawing was started out early on it actually was a little turtle that moved around on the screen so you could see it moving and you could give it command oh right so now you hit the run button can you choose the different colors click to make different colors so now you make blue now you may choose green and you can choose red now you can draw all sorts of stuff so do you want to also let you change it to make it a thick brush or a thin brush sure this is also one of the fun things you could do so go back into design mode and like and pick a slider see that slider put a slider at the top of the screen and we need to choose what the slider goes from what to what right now it goes from zero to 100 let's make it go from like one to one thousand fifteen yeah okay so it goes from one to fifteen so now this is also really easy to do we'll basically make it so this slider chooses our pen width okay so drag another on events blocks how many we're using events all throughout this lesson that's good and then on event choose the slider it's called it's slider one and the event this isn't a click event it's a change event so when the slider changes what we're going to get is now we want to change the width so go to turtle and when you what what you want to do is pen width but the width we're going to need to do it's not like the number three we we need to know what's in the value of the slider so the way you're gonna need to do this is go into ui controls and get the text of what's inside the slider so instead of setting the width to three we'll get the number that's in the slider so now hit run change the slider it looks slightly the same and now it's thin now it's super tight okay wanna make a big red thick thread line yeah it's a thick red line yeah you can i bet you wanted the slider to make even thicker lines didn't you do you want to show how to make really thick lines go to go into design mode and change what the slider can do so right now the slider was going the minimum values from 1 to 15 where would you want it to be 50 okay you're going to break it one of the fun things about coding is trying to break the computer so that's a small slider you would do red red and thick okay behold oh super thick line all right so let's finish off with this um can you show our audience how to share this so that i can get it onto our phone and so we can do this right here maybe the share button click the share button and then hit send to phone and any of you if you have a phone all you need to do is then scan the qr code that shows up on the screen and open it and i'm now going to stop the share and show you this app that we made basically has everything we just did in an app so i can hit the blue and make it small it's kind of hard to show an app while using it on the screen but basically the app that we made is now something we have on our screen as well it's the qr code i went too fast all right so now let's move to our third and last section of today's lesson what we're going to learn about is something super important called artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence is something that's being used everywhere around the world we're not going to be coding the ai right now we're going to be doing what's called training so artificial intelligence means like when computers are like magically smart but we're going to learn about a specific type of artificial intelligence called machine learning and what machine learning is is a computer basically is learning from what we tell it whatever we tell it it learns and so the training we provided is very similar to writing code but instead of writing in code we're just giving it data and when the computer sees enough data it learns we're going to start this with something really simple to using code.org to teach the computer the difference between fish and garbage and this is something that we could use later for having computers learn how to clean our oceans and this is actually important because lots of things like problems like cleaning the ocean and many other world problems are problems that we're going to need machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve so i'm going to share our screen and this is going to be using the code.org ai for ocean's tutorial okay is the fork are you ready so what we want to do right now is we're going to be training the computer and training the ai um so this says is this a fish sophia do you want to do that or do you want to call it out worth it but there's two ways to do this you can do the funny way and just make everything you want the opposite no let's train the ai properly let's say this is not a fish is this a fish yes yes is that a fish yes is that a fish no is that a fish no so you're helping it by training it that's that's a fish that's not a fish that's a fish not a fish right so we've given it 12 pieces of data so far we're training it each time we show it something it can tell the difference between fish and not a fish do you think that's enough data stop stop stop stop stop now let's see if that's enough for ai to tell the difference between fish and garbage hit run and see it's detected wait a second that's not a fish that's a fish that see it's doing a good job it's figured it out yes wait it doesn't know how to recognize apple cores as not being fish newest fish species apples wait wait so if we finish this ai also once we've trained it it can move super fast and if we continue we can see all the things that it chose were fish and it got lots of things right but got some of them wrong now click into the little knot area to see these are all the things it recognizes so if we wanted to help ai do better you would click train more because it didn't have enough data but hold on hold on hold on but i want to show something different let's train ai to do something to learn something that it doesn't know that we don't even know what it is let's have it decide a word to teach like basically we can teach a new word to the ai we can teach it to recognize fish that are fierce or spooky or delicious or wild so why don't we ask the audience what word we should teach our fish somebody says angry angry fish fish wild fish glitchy fish silly fish all right let's choose between okay lots of people said angry let's choose angry fish i like angry birds also but we're going to choose so hold on let's decide are you going to decide or am i going to decide because now it really matters because it's an opinion because before one of those fish or trash you'll do rock paper scissors paper scissors shoot okay you get to the side all right is that fish angry i don't think it's angry okay so not angry how about that one no that one looks angry but it's your opinion i think it looks very it's got like angry eyes with a happy face so i don't know i don't think he's angry you're gonna say it's angry that one's definitely angry this one's sort of angry i'm sad more fish all right go a little faster as you're choosing these i'm just so angry is that guy's angry that one's definitely angry because no no the one you chose oh okay so you're basically not choosing whatever you want and what's important to note here is you might not think that sofia is coding but she's kind of doing the equivalent of coding with machine learning the data that you give ai is the code and the ai is learning from sofia what's angry and what's not angry and what's really important here is that every time sophia is making this decision between not angry and angry she's giving an opinion it's her opinion of what what angry looks like and that opinion is being used to train the computer and we should think when we do this when ai is being trained by a human opinion if she has the wrong opinion she gets to decide and the ai can learn something good or bad because she's the one doing the training this is really relevant because computer systems when they're when you train ai they're not necessarily getting it right or wrong they're just mirroring and repeating the training we give them if the data that we use to train them has some kind of bias for example if she thought that was angry then it would learn wrong the other thing is it's only learning from the fish that we see here so if once we train this it may not work on other types of fish because we're only given a limited set of fish all right so if you hit the continue button so we can see two so now we trained 60 fish and now we can run and have the ai see how well it learned that one's definitely angry wait it's so it's doing okay but i would say not perfect so can you speed it up okay i got some what does that oh i'm angry so let's hit continue to see all the fish that it determines that are angry and sad so some of these so now what's cool is we can actually find out why it thought something was angry it stopped this was angry because of its mouth and because of its tail click on one of the other ones and we can see why he thinks it's angry that one because of its eyes and its mouth let's see that one now that one also its eyes and its mouth that one its eyes and for some reason it thinks that dorsal fin is angry why do i think this one is angry okay the eyes uh you thought the sort of black eyes are angry they're kind of cute so you can find out for all the things the reason why hey i thought something i personally think the eyes are the top thing that shows when it's angry but basically since you fed it with those opinions that's what it's going to go for yeah don't judge a fish by its cover yeah don't it's generally not good to judge a book by its cover or a fish and this by the way is actually pretty relevant because computer scientists are doing some kind of weird things with machine learning so if you did you know that there's this is going to kind of bother you there's people that are already using machine learning to look at somebody's face and decide whether that person is trustworthy or not whether you can trust them or not just by seeing a photo of them and they're training machine learning just by giving it pictures and saying that that person's trustworthy that person is not trustworthy is it fair to judge whether somebody is trustworthy or not just by looking at their face no it's kind of not fair like imagine if a computer decided whether you should be allowed whether you should get a job or not based on what your face looks like that's not okay uh and the reality is the computer doesn't know what is okay or not it doesn't know what's ethical or not ethical it's the person who's training that ai who needs to decide is this actually a good thing to train a computer to do and so if you're training a computer to decide if somebody if you can trust somebody based on how they look that's kind of a bad thing we teach our children don't you know judge people by their looks so we should also teach your computers the same thing as well all right so i have one last thing to show with ai since we taught uh since we talked to the computer how to recognize angry or sad fish we're also gonna teach uh using basically computer vision how to recognize angry versus sad emotions so um and i'm going to be the one doing this because last time we did try this very bad ass showing my facial emotions literally okay so i'm going to first see uh sofia you're going to be the computer so you try to recognize my emotion what emotion is this i think that's happy what am i happy okay what emotion is this that's sad sad what emotion is this that's angry so now let's try something else i want to see if you can do it this way what emotion am i showing now happy that's a good guess you could tell just from looking at my eyes and what emotion am i showing now angry yeah now what emotion am i showing well i mean there's only one left so sad okay sad so the reason i showed that is you can tell my emotions just by looking at the upper part of my face and that's partly because you know me very well now let's see if we can train an ai to detect some of these things so i'm going to screen share again we're going to screen share in something called teachable machine this isn't on code.org but we're working at code.org building something similar as well teachable machine if you google it as this tool and what we're going to teach the ui of the ai is detect happy from sad sad too angry angry sleepy all right um and so if you come off the screen or i'll i'll the camera just point it let's do this part you're going to run away for a little bit so what we're going to do is teach the you can still be close so we can hear you all right so we're going to use the webcam and i'm going to show i'm going to train the ai what happy looks like so happy so that's my happy look then i'm gonna train the ai to see what sad looks like this is sad sad i'm giving it all these images i got 60 examples of sad then lastly i'm going to show it what angry looks like that's angry all right so we gave it happy sad and angry and now we can hit click to train the model and now it's taking all these images that we gave it 26 happy images 60 sad images and 41 angry images and it's going to take a little bit of time to train sophia you can come and come and see what's going on right now so while this is training you were watching from afar um and you know why so what what i want to do is i'm gonna have it basically um let me screen share again i'm gonna have it try to recognize my emotions and then see if it can recognize your emotions see it's training basically it's going from counting from 1 to 50 using all the images that we gave it all right so if you can you step off screen again so now let's see what is it saying it's saying happy it sees down here that i'm happy now let's see if i change to sad will it recognize do you think it'll work for me you know how angry he recognizes angry for sure but sad can i try all right so it's basically looking at the webcam and detecting my emotions let's see if it knows any of your emotions okay ain't nothing on screen yet okay so now go happy angry it's just all sad basically it's the computer we trained it to see my emotions but when we have somebody else on screen it can't recognize at all do you know why it can't tell sofia no because we've trained it the very limited number of images we showed them only showed me in my face so as humans when you look at my face and your face you can tell what's going on and as humans when we see what you've learned what angry and sad looks like not only in my face but in all sorts of other people as well the computer we just gave it 60 images of each one thing and we only trained it on my my face so when we gave it your face it doesn't work this is also true in computer vision on all sorts of other things for example image recognition in general you can't just be trained on one set of people's faces you need to train it on people from different genders different races different ethnicities and this is kind of one of the problems with machine learning and computer vision is if you teach a computer to recognize faces that are white once they see faces that are black or brown they might not be as recognizable or asians and this isn't just a question of like does facebook know how to tag you in photos properly there's a number of reasons this is really important consider for example uh diagnosing of diseases the same computer vision that we did to show the teacher computer recognized happy from sad it's just looking we could have that look at teach a computer to look at xrays and to detect sick from healthy or to look at mri scans and try to detect cancer cells from not cancer cells but if you do that you need to make sure that if you're going to use machine learning for diagnosing a disease it should work well across genders it would be bad if you only showed xrays of male patients and then learned how to detect a disease but then the system doesn't work with women or if you did it only with people from one background like only white patients and then people who are uh indian or african the diagnosis doesn't work or maybe it does work but it's less accurate if it's slightly less accurate depending on your race is that fair no that's a tough question and there's so many ethical questions when you're basically coding an algorithm using data so you know when you're coding an algorithm with events like the dance you say when a do the dab it's it does exactly what you tell it but when you're coding it with data you need to figure out how much data is enough we didn't give it enough data to detect the fish from the trash and so the computer made mistakes and whether it's things like diagnosing diseases helping a car know how to avoid a pedestrian if it's going to be a selfdriving car so it automatically hits the brakes all these types of things the data we give it to code the computer is very critical to make sure the computer is is and the algorithm is doing things ethically the way we want it to be all right we're at the end of our hours so we're going to get going now thank you so much to everybody from eu code week who joined us today we learned about events and we learned about algorithms algorithms and we learned about ai artificial intelligence and if you want to learn any of these things yourself you can go to code.org and all the exercises we did you can find over there as well so and there's lots of other fun things at code.org at home for example you can learn how to make your own star wars game and again share it to your phone and all sorts of stuff you also learned about my bug yeah we learned about sofia's bug so thank you everybody we're going to tune out now and enjoy the rest of your code week bye should we leave this camera on while everybody's saying goodbye i'm gonna click leave okay you
