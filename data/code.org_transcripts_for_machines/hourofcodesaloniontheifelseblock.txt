An IFELSE statement is a decision between two things. So say for example, if it's a weekday, it's time to go to school, otherwise you can stay home and have fun. Now let's see how we can use an IFELSE statement with our zombie. This block looks the same as the IF block, but there's an extra part on the bottom that says ELSE. If I put a "move" block where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else", that means the zombie will move forward if there's the path ahead, and if there's not a path ahead the zombie will turn left. It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that decision. And just like IF blocks you can put IFELSE blocks inside REPEAT blocks. Now let's get those Zombies back to where they belong.
