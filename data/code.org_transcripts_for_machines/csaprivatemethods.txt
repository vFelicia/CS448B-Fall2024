when a chef makes spaghetti with meatballs they have several tasks they have to complete but when i go to a restaurant and order spaghetti i just ask for spaghetti with meatballs i don't need to know what goes into making it in java we have used public methods that we call to complete tasks in the body of the method we write the code that should run when the method is called a user doesn't have to know how it works in order to use the method sometimes even a public method needs to complete multiple tasks to achieve its goal a private method is a method that is accessible only from within the class we can use private methods to simplify complex tasks spaghetti may not be complicated to make but it does have multiple tasks in our restaurant class we have a method called make spaghetti in this method we could write all the steps it takes to make spaghetti or we could use private methods to represent the specific tasks that make up the process of making spaghetti a helper method is a method that performs a component of another method we could write private methods for make noodles make meatballs make sauce these are examples of helper methods in our make spaghetti method we can then call these private methods to make the meal first we make the noodles then make the meatballs and finally make the sauce why make these methods private a customer should only be able to ask for spaghetti they can't ask for just noodles or just meatballs or just sauce these methods are private so they are only accessible from within the restaurant class this also makes it much easier to read and maintain our restaurant code if the chef wanted to update the recipe for the sauce they can easily make the change private methods are helpful for organizing our code and breaking down complex tasks you
