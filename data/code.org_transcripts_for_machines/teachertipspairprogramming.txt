so prep programming is super beneficial in the classroom uh if you use it often at the beginning of your school year by the middle and the end of the year you're not gonna have to prom them i have my students working together from the first lesson unit one lesson one with the rapid prototype and i usually keep those groups together going through the course with modifications here and there but that teamwork that they establish from day one gives them the confidence to get through the rest of the course where they know they can rely on their partner who's sitting beside them or they can talk to someone else in the classroom and feel like they can share their ideas and get feedback anytime a student does something for the first time they're not going to do it very well the only way they're going to get better is with practice several iterations you modeling and encouraging and supporting and so patience that's what's going to help when debugging becomes um a collaborative experience it starts to become a lot more fun it becomes more like a investigate and become the detective type of role and so encouraging collaboration pair programming can help them debug as a new css teacher i do recommend that you have timers and make the timers fun ask the students to stand up from the chairs when they have to change the role from navigator to driver and have the timer go in different chunks of time start giving the students a minute here to be a driver a minute there to be the navigator and after you prime them with this the last chunk of time make it longer and you will notice that the students actually start switching because they they learn the routine they learn the technique and they switch from navigator to driver without you prompting them to do so i had two different students and they worked really well together when they were their programming and it was interesting because they were totally opposites of each other one was really introverted one was really extroverted and kind of boisterous and the interaction back and forth between them was so hilarious they had a great relationship in this instance but most of the time they probably wouldn't talk with each other even though they were working together solving problems they were having fun you
