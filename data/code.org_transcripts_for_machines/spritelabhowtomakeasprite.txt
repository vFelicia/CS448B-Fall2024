It's time to dig into some fun features of Sprite Lab. The first thing to do is set up a sprite. To add a sprite you can use the "make a new sprite" block. This block lets you give your sprite a name, a costume and a location. This sprite is named Dusty and the costume is a fish. If you want to change Dusty's location you can click the pin and the location block and then click where you want Dusty to go. Dusty's looking a little too big. To make a sprite smaller you can use this "set sprite size" block. Let's change Dusty's size to 50... that's much more better. Action blocks like "set size" run only once. Now let's get Dusty moving by using a behavior. You can start by giving Dusty the "spinning right" behavior. Once the behavior begins it will run over and over again forever, or until you tell it to stop. And that's all there is to it. Now it's your turn! Subtitles by the Amara.org community
