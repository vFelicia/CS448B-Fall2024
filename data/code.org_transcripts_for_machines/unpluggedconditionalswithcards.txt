This lesson is called conditionals with cards. Every day you make decisions based on what you see and hear. I want to walk to the park but first I have to decide if I should bring an umbrella or not. So I look out the window. If it's cloudy, I'm going to take my umbrella. Else, I'll take some sunglasses. I think I'd better take the umbrella. What I see and hear determines what I take to the park. Conditionals are used in games too. Today we're going to practice using conditionals with a card game. In this game, the card that I draw determines what my friends are going to do. If I draw a seven, everyone claps. Else, everyone says "awww." Let's try it! I bet you can make up games that are even more fun with conditionals. Give it a try! Conditionals are what make computers seem smart. A computer program that includes conditionals can react to the user and change its course of action. Think about your favorite video game. Do you earn more points for some actions than you do for others? This occurs because the computer is using conditionals. It's the way a computer makes a decision. How about, if you hit the target, you earn ten points. Else, you lose three. When you know how conditionals work, you can create all kinds of exciting games.
