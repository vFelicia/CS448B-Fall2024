hello hello and welcome to today's my journey class chat my name is cat leia ramos and i'm going to be your host for today's chat a little bit about myself i'm actually a software engineer at code.org which means i get to basically code all day so first of all thank you to all the teachers and the students out there for joining us today teachers just so you know we have enabled live captioning for all of our class chats today and going forward so you'll see that on the screen and today we get to talk with tanya parker we're very excited tanya parker helps build virtual reality experiences at mediquest so we're very excited to talk to her today teachers as we're talking and going through questions if you have any questions that come up please put them in the chat that way we can see them and if we have time at the end we'll try to get to as many questions that we can alright so i'm going to kick us off with a fun icebreaker this is something i've been doing a lot while being at home and during the pandemic just not really going and seeing people in person but i've been doing a lot of show and tells so the way this works is i will pick something from around my desk i will show it to you and i will tell you about it so today my show and tell are these slippers that i have they look like dumplings they're very soft very warm and they're kind of cool because if you can see they plug in to power and they actually are heated so when it's really cold i can keep my feet nice and warm all right so now i'm gonna go ahead and pass it off to you tanya give us a little show and tell and then um introduce yourself i'll grab something too uh who doesn't like a heated val cozy oh yeah i love my share of cozy things as well these are some stuffed animals from my neighbor totoro which is a studio ghibli film um i love a lot of studio ghibli films especially the ones directed by miyazaki so couldn't resist these little guys very very cute um so yeah tanya could you just give us a quick intro about yourself sure i'll share my screen and show you some of the things i work on so hi my name is tanya i'm a senior technical program manager at oculus now known as metaquest and i work on for a company that creates virtual reality experiences so if you've seen this this is the quest 2 it's a really popular device in a way for you to connect to these virtual reality experiences as a technical program manager i get to do a little bit of everything so if you've heard of software engineering product design product management i work with all kinds of roles and disciplines to problem solve and create these 3d immersive experiences so virtual reality is like playing a video game but instead of 2d it's 3d and you're completely surrounded by a new environment so you can feel like you're in a totally different place when you're just in your living room uh so here is an example of what this quest two looks like and something i get to work with and play on almost every day as part of my job very cool yes i think i have played a one virtual reality game called beat saber maybe you're familiar with it but it's cool because there's music but it's scary because you're in the video game and then as music is playing there's blocks going by and you kind of have this virtual sword that you're using to cut through the blocks but yeah it's very cool to be in the game um awesome so you kind of describe that you're a technical project manager and that you work on virtual reality i'm kind of curious can you tell us um maybe a little bit more about virtual reality and maybe even some projects that you've been working on sure so uh virtual reality can really be you know it's up to your imagination of all the things that virtual reality can do and that's one of the really cool things about my job is we're trying to figure out how to build metaverse in a way that helps connect people in our communities so here's an example of a home environment you know you could build your dream home for example with awesome high ceilings huge tv screen fancy food it can really be anything you could go travel the world you can play games like beat saber you can um stay fit you know like maybe something your parents would like to do and some of the projects that i work on uh one example is i have enabled notifications so on your phone when you get a text message or some kind of notification we can now show that on your headset so you don't have to remove your headset to look at your phone and read that notification so it's a way for you to stay in the virtual reality space and get to stay plugged in without having to disrupt or interrupt the experience and really enjoy yourself in virtual reality wow that's very cool that makes me realize you could basically just be living in the virtual reality all the time because you can get all of your notifications very very cool um can you tell us a little bit more about what your daytoday looks like a typical day in your life at work yeah so i have a very collaborative job which means i don't work on things by myself i have to work with a ton of people all the time which for adults that's usually a lot of meetings so we usually have a bunch of problems to solve every day where we need to decide what something looks like feels like how people experience it so that they really have fun and are engaged and enjoy the experience and so we just try to build that in the best way possible so we ask each other a lot of questions we want to make sure we build it the right way so we are protecting people's privacy and just making it overall a very like enjoyable way for people to relax entertain themselves and connect so i am usually just walking through a lot of those problems until we're able to get to you know these milestones are just uh checkpoints into creating and launching our project or feature um so as another example one cool thing about the oculus quest is that you have these controllers that you know allow you to point and choose and show where your hands are and so an example of a problem that we needed to solve is we want to get rid of these controllers so that you can just use your hands and point and click and touch and grab and really interact with the environment so it feels like you're grabbing things and and and it feels real um and so that's a problem that you know nobody's saw before and somebody had to solve it and so that's what's really exciting is that uh you get to be creative in solving these problems and figuring it out together yeah that sounds really cool just because thinking about oftentimes thinking about technology and software but also virtual reality and 3d spaces these are all things that are brand new and so i'm sure problems are coming up all the time related to things that don't even exist yet and it's kind of like wow how do you solve a problem that no one's even tried to solve before i was kind of curious because you mentioned collaborating with a lot of people and working together in a group to kind of solve a problem i i'm just wondering do you have any takeaways or tips that you've learned from working with others that you feel like wow this is really helpful when you're working in a group and you're trying to solve a really hard problem i think the most important thing to realize is that everybody thinks about it a little differently and so the whole point of working on it together is listening to everybody's perspective and hearing what ideas they have what options they're suggesting and really making it a melting pot of like of those ideas um so it's being flexible to hearing a different thinking or point of view um hearing you know other ways to to approach the problem other ideas so just being open and listening to each other and just kind of going through each of the ideas and suggestions so that you can weigh the pros and cons or what we call tradeoffs in the industry uh and then that way that can help you make a choice together versus having to always have one person pick for example but sometimes it helps to have a leader or a manager who really can drive the conversation but i think what makes this kind of role so much more rewarding is that we can do this together that's awesome so i'm hearing that sometimes it's actually more helpful when you're pro problem solving or you have something you don't know the answer to to actually include more people because like you mentioned you get more perspectives and you get a lot of people seeing it from different points of view yeah i definitely agree that comes up in my daytoday a lot too definitely and the more diversity you have with like your coworkers and the people that you hire the more that you can represent the people that you are creating this for because virtual reality is for everyone for anyone and we want to make sure that it works for all kinds of people awesome yeah it's great that that's all top of mind for you including as many people as you can great what do you love about your job what's awesome about your job uh what's awesome it is really exciting to be able to create these experiences that millions of people can use and and enjoy so something that feels like oh i'm just deciding the small piece or building this little little feature it really makes an impact on people's lives and how they get to relax at the end of the day um or how they get to connect with their friends you know something with the pandemic is thankfully video conferences has has become more norm and people are like having um like birthday parties and and sort of things virtually and so we hope that virtual reality can have that same build that same bridge uh so it's really exciting to be able to to build that next step um but i also really like that having a job like this enables me to do a lot of other things in my life like i get to have a really great worklife balance and enjoy um life so i live in seattle and i do a lot of outdoorsy things like hiking with my dog i have a corgi i tried my first triathlon last year um i really like to travel and so i get a lot of good vacation time and enjoy a lot of food while i travel as well so here's some some pictures of me my friends my boyfriend here in jollibee is uh one of these filipino fast food chain restaurants and it's my favorite chick fried chicken um so i just wanted to show a little bit of that like my work is great and it's just it's it's a great way for also for me to enjoy my my my life outside of work oh i love that i'm also filipinoamerican so jolly b is very near and dear to my heart and if anyone out there could try the fried chicken at jollibee you will be very happy um that's great i also want to give a quick reminder that if teachers students as you're listening if any questions come up definitely feel free to put them in the chat so we can get to them at the end um if you have any questions about anything tanya has mentioned so far definitely please do ask those questions we'd love to hear them um cool so you told us a little bit about what you love about your job about what you love to do outside of work uh kind of curious when you were younger maybe even around the age between like a kindergarten and i think maybe fifth grade is where some of our audiences are at so when you were younger what did you want to be when you grew up and why oh um that's a great question because i had a lot of things in mind um when i was younger my parents really wanted me to be a lawyer and i thought that seemed kind of cool i watched a bunch of movies where people got to argue in court and win cases and i felt like that would be fun um but then i realized that you know court's a really small part of that job and there's a lot more about the job that i probably wouldn't enjoy as much uh i really liked um a criminology class i took in middle school and so i i was fascinated by fingerprint analysis and um how people analyze like evidence at crime scenes and i thought that was really cool too but a little grim um but i was also interested in landscape architecture i love plants flowers and gardens and i thought it'd be interesting to design places that would attract lots of birds and butterflies and just be an escape an oasis but eventually i found computer science and it caught me by surprise i had not even heard of it until high school a friend of mine wanted to take the ap computer science class and i did not know it was and he suggested he thought it might be fun for me i was like why not i'll give it a try and i loved it i just completely loved it um i enjoyed it because it just it was such a great mix of that creative creative side and analytical side where i really loved math and science but i also felt artistic and computer science kind of just lets you use all of those skills when you're creating things so when i applied for college i applied to have schools in business just in case that's sort of what my mom was like well in case you know you you don't like computer science business is a safe option and half the school's computer science and i eventually accepted uh university of southern california computer science computer engineering degree and then i freaked out uh during my welcome week i was hearing all kinds of things suggesting otherwise like people saying that all the jobs would be outsourced you know you're not gonna have a job out of college and eventually i found that that was completely untrue but at the time it scared me and i changed my major to chemical engineering because then i thought i liked chemistry you know kind of related back to that criminology that i was interested in when i was much younger um but i just wasn't enjoying myself it you know you just kind of feel it when you aren't happy and you're just sort of doing the motions and luckily in that in that major i was uh required to take a computer science 101 or an introduction class and it was awesome and i had so much fun it was like the only class i remember wanting to have extra homework just because i thought the problems were fun and i wanted to solve more of them and i realized you know what this is what i like to do i saw in lots of career fairs everybody is looking for computer science majors because it's not just computer engineer software engineers that you know that major can help but there are lots of applications and other roles like mine that a computer science degree is super useful for so i switched back eventually found my way um and i started out as a software engineer at co.org actually and eventually tried product management and technical program management and this is my happy place long story short but that's great because i think it really showcases that like when i was younger i used to think oh you you know what you want to do when you're really young and you know what you're passionate about and then you go to school and you study that and then you do it and i think that your story really showcases that sometimes it's really good to try a lot of things and explore a lot of things because you never know what you're going to be interested in i also loved hearing that you know all of these things you were interested like the problem solving from you know the criminal like criminology and um the creativity with the landscaping that you found a way to explore a bunch of things and then find something that really combined it all which i think is so true with technology nowadays because you never know what's what jobs are going to exist in 10 years from now maybe something you really love will will come up that you've never even heard of um and this question actually ties really well into a question we actually got from the audience if it's okay for me to ask that now um coach mo asks do you think in a hundred years from now most people will have vr headsets and maybe even uh vr headsets for free 100 years from now so technology evolves quite rapidly it changes so fast but i think it's going to be completely different not in the headset that we know of because headsets are pretty clunky they're heavy you can't really use them for very long um and as we've seen with things like cell phones and computers things will get smaller and yet perform better and faster and stronger and so i'm hoping that it's something like a contact lens you know not even glasses or maybe it's something that um is sort of bio or like in your body you put in a a little thing or a stamp and it just sort of appears and you can press a little button on your body and you're there um do i think everybody will be there yes honestly that's why i work here i think that's the future you know it's the next internet it's the next wave that people will become obsessed with like how much time do we spend on our phones on ticktock you know watching people do things trying to try to connect with people through technology so maybe not through headsets but will people be in the middle verse yes absolutely oh yeah the way you just described that just reminded me of all like superhero movies and every movie i watch with technology they're kind of just like opening things with their hands and it's right there in space they don't have to use a computer um and i totally agree with you never know yeah you never know what's going to exist in 10 years things are changing so quickly yeah um all right i'm gonna jump to a final question um and i really love this question because i think it's really helpful what advice would you give to students out there listening who might be starting to learn computer science well i hope you're having the best time i wish i could be in your shoes enjoying it for the first time too um but i think you know one if you if you're not sure if you like it or not stay open and try it give it a shot um it's so new you know like even even for me when i was learning about it it wasn't a thing or people didn't know very much about it at that age and i think you're so lucky to be exposed to it now um so give it a shot and see what you like about it and encourage your friends too um don't be afraid to make mistakes and that's the whole point of it is it's not going to be perfect the first time you're going to try one thing it's not going to work and then you're going to make tweaks and tweaks and tweaks and tweaks and it'll be so satisfying when you finally get it to work it's just you're going to spend hours on it thinking about it and coming going away and coming back and there's nothing like that that feeling when you when you finally solve it figure it out like i did that you know nobody showed me how to do it nobody did it for me i figured it out on my own and i made this thing you know maybe the computer said something maybe i made a website maybe i made an app like it's just so much fun to see that tangible in a way digital but you know something you created came out of your brain and that's what i feel like is so exciting about it so stick with it be persistent you know keep trying and keep trying different ways until you until you reach that point of success awesome well tonya thank you so much i think we're we're wrapping up on time here so again yeah thank you so much for all of your insight thank you to the teachers and students that are watching a quick reminder that we have more uh class chats just like this coming up this spring and we also have past chats that have been recorded that you can watch teachers and students in your classrooms you can find all the information about that at code.org cs journeys and also remind our teachers please check your email for surveys we really appreciate your feedback it's how we grow and we can make these class chats better for you and your students so please i'll be really excited to read your feedback and please do share that with us but yeah thank you so much everyone for joining us today thank you tanya again and that's our chat
