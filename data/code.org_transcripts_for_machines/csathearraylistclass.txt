let's make a grocery list we'll pull out a piece of paper and add a single item like bread if we want to add to the list we'll need a new piece of paper with room for another item the first piece of paper gets scrapped and a new list is made on a new piece of paper we have to copy over bread and then add our second item each time we add an item we need a larger piece of paper this happens over and over again as new items are added we could initialize a 1d array to hold all the items but we don't know how many items we need to buy and we don't want a piece of paper that is too large either this is where an arraylist comes in handy an arraylist is a class that represents a resizable list the arraylist class has a constant to set the default size to 10. it also has an instance variable for a 1d array since the 1d array type is an object an arraylist can only hold objects when items are added to an array list it stores them in this 1d array once the number of items exceeds 10 it creates a new 1d array one size larger and copies over the items to the new 1d array this means that if we want to store primitive data types in an array list we have to use the corresponding wrapper class for example using the integer class instead of int let's create an arraylist the arraylist class is part of the package java.util we can import the entire package by saying java.util.star or we can import just the arraylist class by saying java.util.arraylist we need to write either of these import statements at the top of our file now we can make the arraylist by typing arraylist followed by a set of angle brackets these angle brackets are where you specify the data type you want to store in the array list since we cannot use int we have to use integer let's call this list number array to instantiate our arraylist object we use the new keyword then called the arraylist constructor the arraylist class is special since it uses angle brackets to specify its type so we have to say arraylist then open a set of angle brackets inside the angle brackets we specify the type then we end with an empty set of parentheses to call the no argument constructor the no argument constructor initializes the 1d array instance variable with a default size of 10. this list can now be filled with as many integers as we'd like an arraylist is a powerful data structure that we can use to add more flexibility to our lists they hold objects and manage the work of creating new 1d arrays as we add new items to our list you
