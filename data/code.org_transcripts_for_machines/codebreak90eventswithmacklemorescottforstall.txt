you can skip yet welcome to code break my name is hadi and there's so many people joining us across zoom on facebook live and on youtube live together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom with so many students at home during this virus outbreak my team at code.org invites families everywhere to join us for a weekly dose of inspiration community and computer science i'm here with my daughter sophia who's a budding computer scientist and she's also my sidekick and she has a little sound board so she's going to make sounds for us during the this episode i'd like to introduce our first special guest grammy awardwinning rapper and songwriter ben hagerty known to most of you as macklemore uh macklemore are you there with us i am yes how's it going good great how are you i am fantastic so i have a first question should i be calling you ben or macklemore uh ben is great ben is great does your i guess i was we're wondering which which way to go are so many syllables it's so difficult to pronounce how does it actually play out to the ear it's just challenging then your mom doesn't call you macklemore anything no i i do request that she calls me macklemore yes that's the only person how are you handling being at home what have you been doing uh what have you been working on during this time i have been you know i have a almost fiveyearold daughter and i have a twoyearold daughter so i have been very active on the parenting front i have been making some music i have been um it's just kind of i it's ups and downs you know okay it kind of goes hour to hour what's going on a lot of walks in the neighborhood um you know we've been watching some movies at night doing some school work it's it's all over the place and do you have any message to give to students who are all at home with school closed all around the world to inspire them about the importance of learning during this time i think it's super important for for all of us to keep our brain engaged to you know for me it was super important to create some sort of routine when i find myself like okay what am i doing today i'm just kind of floating that's when you know my mood can kind of go up and down and life gets a little bit weird i think that what i've found during this this pandemic is that structure is really important for me and keeping the brain active you know still focusing you know if you're in school still focusing on school work and making sure that we're just doing our our very best you know um and that goes for all of us whether you're in elementary school middle school high school or you're an adult i think just keeping the brain going really helps overall just keep our emotions even keel well thank you for sharing that um well to change the mood a little bit sophia's gonna get us started with the computer science joke of the day so if you're ready yes what is a computer's favorite type of music i have no idea it is disc oh nice oh all right well uh you know there's a there's just the two of us that have been talking but we i want to introduce you to the rest of our live audience uh we have a few dozen students on camera and you can see them uh right now and by the way macklemore if you don't or ben if you don't see them at all on your screen you may need to click this button so if you see mainly me you can click this button on your screen which will show you the rest of the students most people see a whole grid of students but that button would it'll be in the upper right hand side of your screen if you want to click that to see them and that's just a set of folks who are on camera can you all wave hello and say hi all at once we're going to mute you everybody oh rest of our audiences by the way because that's just the folks on camera if we do a i'm going to do a quick screen share as people were joining this call we should map so you can actually see this map of where everybody's calling from uh you know this live zoom call has almost a thousand students calling from as far west as as hawaii where it's like 7 a.m and far east as far as new zealand or australia or japan uh it's pretty incredible the set of people who are calling i have one of my own cousins calling from iran right now so that's amazing it's incredible a number of students are basically online at the same time here for education so one thing i want to say as we go through this episode for those of you who are new if you have any questions during the episode whether for me or for macklemore for our other special guests you can go to code.org questions to learn about it and today's uh episode is going to be super fun today we're going to learn about events and we have three parts we're going to learn about events unplugged in computer programming and then we're going to code our own dance and then we're going to learn about how to use advanced in apps we're going to start as always with the easy material first we have a lot of beginners if you're more advanced please be patient until we get to the more advanced stuff and ben just so you know our audience ranges from age six all the way to 60 or more uh although the probably the biggest group is basically 12 year olds or 13 year olds or 11 year olds like sophia before we go into lesson the lesson i want to welcome some guests to demo the stuff that they created from last week's challenge was to modify our alien coin game or to to make your own storytelling app and each week when you share your creations with us we'll invite the best ones on the episode uh to to meet with our special guests so the first thing i want to do is screen share to show rifky's app so rifki are you there with us yes hello and where are you calling from calling you from kuala lumpur malaysia kuala lumpur malaysia so let me show his app and macklemore you can take a look at this so this app starts as a whole iphone screen and you get to tell a story so we're going to click to see what stories are available uh let's pick story number two and you get to enter it's basically kind of an adlib macamore do you wanna ben do you wanna help us with this by choosing a name and an adjective okay oh man the adjectives and the nouns this is gonna what what it's an adjective this is where i'm gonna be embarrassed because we're supposed to be learning and here i am not knowing what adjective is so for some reason i had you know i had a lapse of language arts and the very formative years of learning adjectives and nouns no worries so we'll use the name ben sophia you want to pick an adjective thank you sophia save me and i'll use another one fast and another one super cool and then for a noun we'll do a ball and another noun will be a car and an object one day ben went to an odd ball to look for a battery pack but crashed into a fast car it was a truly super day that's that's a cool story risky thank you for joining us and let's i want to show the next apps that our students made from bangalore india shiranya and miranlini made two games uh these are basically remixes of the alien coin game that we made uh last week uh and i'm not sure which one is on which side unfortunately these two couldn't join us tonight uh well to the this morning because for them it's really really late at night oh are you here on yet yes we are here oh hi hi hi hi there uh sorry i thought you weren't going to be on screen it's great to have you so which one of you made which one of these i made the game in that is that the alien is collecting the gold medals and then with the game with the pink alien color in the rubies all right well thank you so much for both of you uh i'm going to stop the screen share but i just want to say thank you to rifki to sharanya tamir and leni and to all the students who have made apps or games each week from the challenges that we send to you each week and at the end of the episode we're going to share out how you can sign up to get our weekly challenges to come on the show for next week so to start this week's uh episode our word of today is events when we program a computer we use events to tell the computer to do things in response to the user for example we might tell a computer that when the user clicks on an apple add one to the score or when the up arrow key is pressed move the screen up and today we want to model this with macklemore and with our students on camera with a fun event that is going to involve dancing as long as everybody's ready to dance uh so ben we sent you a secret package yesterday did you receive our secret package yes i have the secret package all right it says do not open until the show can you open that up and tell us what you see inside there absolutely looks like i got some some letters here all right let's see your letters some secret letters a whoa b and c all right so very secret thank you so what we want to do is we want ben to use events to choreograph all of us to dance and when i say all of us i mean everybody not just sophia and myself but everybody who's on camera and even those of you who are not on camera and the way we're going to do this using events is when an event happens we're going to do a dance move and an event is when ben holds up his card whether it's an a or a b or a c and for each one of those we're going to have a different dance move so let's start with what dance moves should we do when the when ben is holding up an a we're going to do an audience pull to let the audience choose the first dance move when we do the letter a can we put up the poll on screen so everybody can choose between a clap a knee kick a dab or a floss this is gonna look like a slightly tight race here uh all these votes coming in oh my gosh it's a really tight race between the dab and the floss all right uh we have 78 of you have voted i think we're gonna need to run this to the end to make sure we get a final winner the floss is barely ahead of the dab this is a pretty tight election what do you think ben this is intense i it's kind of we're gonna have to go individual accounts all right let's close the polls we're not done but i'd say the floss is the winner ooh close so when the a key is pressed and this is the code that maps to that when the when sorry when an a is showing our dancers are going to floss and sophia do you want to model that for us so that we know what a floss looks like for anybody who's not familiar so when an a is pressed that's the floss all right so ben we want you to choose the next stance move so when a b is is pressed uh what would you like you can your choices are a dab a clap or a kick uh you know i'm gonna have to go with uh the classic knee kick the knee kick all right so sophia was in last place i felt bad for the knee kick the knee kick so sofia is doing a knee kick yeah so when a b is showing everybody's going to knee kick so when a b is showing we want you to knee kick and you want to pick for our last move then for a c when the c is showing your choices are i think a clap now or a dab i think we got a dab got a dab sophia you want to model that for everybody to know what a dab looks like no no do it do it well not everybody knows what a dab looks like there's a dab right so when a c is showing the dancers are going to dab so i want to review this one more time this is a very simple program we've written and i want everybody to be doing this when an a is showing our dancers are going to floss and macklemore is going to be generating these events our code is that when a b is showing we want to kick and when a c is showing we want to dab so a is loss b is kick c is dab and ben when you're showing these i want you to uh also say the letters as well in case somebody has trouble seeing your camera so they can follow on with your voice as well so i think we're all gonna do this dance and i actually have a very special guest who hasn't ever joined us on code which is my sixyearold son marcy he's gonna join us as well hi so i'm gonna start the song ben are you ready to give us our events i'm ready to go all right and are all the dancers ready everybody on the screen is ready so we're going to start this dance ready set go hey hey hey okay well that was wonderful thank you for leading us in that ben i'm sure that wasn't what you were expecting when you got on this zoom call that was awesome and we're sending off muzzy off uh well that was the first live dance party coded on on a code break so what i wanted to do is actually see if we could write code to make the exact same dances happen by using code now using uh basically a tool on code.org called dance party and sophia here is gonna actually be my partner in crime coder and she's gonna basically code the exact same dance moves for us to do this i'm gonna screen share so just one second as my share my screen all right if you all see my screen over here on the left we're on code.org dance party and on the left is going to show where the dancers are on the right is where sophie is going to make the code and over here in all these little categories we have the commands she can use so sophia to start do you want to set up and give us a background for our dance world and ben do you want to help us choose a background sophia what are your two favorites my favorites are the fireworks in the laser dance floor oh laser dance floor laser dance floor it is right and sophia not put a dancer on the screen like always a cat all right and put them in the center of the screen all right now we want to use events just like we did all in person so go into the events area and say when a key is pressed but right now it says when the up arrow is pressed change that to the when the a key is pressed and if you remember we said when the a shows the dancers are going to floss so yep choose that one and make sure it's the cat just the cat yeah the cat is gonna floss and the dance move is gonna be a floss and now uh we can copy and paste to say when the b key is pressed so if you click on that block and copy and paste it and say when the b key is pressed and this is our code we wrote before when b is showing the dancer's kick and choose kick do you want to be a kick and now we copy again using command c to copy the block and command v to paste it it's up here it's up here so if you do it make sure these are all cats yes you want the cats dab so the a makes a floss the b is a kick and the c is a dab and before we run this uh one thing i point out i want to point out is last time when we played a song it was kind of a song that nobody ever heard before ben were you familiar with that song i'm guessing you weren't uh but for code.org dance party with the reason we chose a song nobody ever heard is because you don't want to use music in a way that's not licensed that's one of the things we teach in computer science is the importance of copyrights and licensing music but we're very lucky in code.org that we actually have all these awesome songs that were licensed and in fact the song can't hold us by macklemore and ryan lewis was the very first song that that code got the rights to use for educational purposes so we're going to use that song for sofia's dance and now she is going to control the dancers when we hit the run button so ready set go those are some big kicks so we can see sophia made her own little dance party where she's controlling it but one thing we could do with events is we can have a danceoff where so vni competes so i'm actually going to now write some code to make a second dancer to compete with sophia's little cat dancer uh and then i want your help to make my dancer way cooler than sophia's so no way yes no so mine is gonna be a what what kind of dancer should i be how about i could be either a robot or a shark what would you prefer let's go shark shark i'm going to be a shark and we're going to move sofia on that's where the am and i'll be on the left should we change the fireworks as our background yeah that was the other favorite and i'm also going to give us a foreground effect let's have a bee stage lights that's right you like stage lights right and i'm going to copy the code that sofia had command c command b and i'm going to use the right side of the keyboard so i'm going to have the pencil oh yeah so i'm going to say when the j key is pressed i'm going to have the shark do a move uh and i'm going to pick it to be i don't know uh so ben what would you prefer you could choose between a body roll uh i like a body roll i think that's a strong play body roll is good all right and let's have the audience pick my other dance moves so let's do a poll for everybody to vote on the favorite dance moves we do next if we could put a poll up on the screen no pull is the pole showing or not all right so we have a choice between that we've already used the body roll so choose between disco kick and zombie oh you want to use the kick too okay all right alex all right so all right i'm gonna go with the disco and the zombie because those are the popular ones so we're gonna have when the k key is pressed we're gonna have the cat the sharks do a zombie this is going to be a zombie move and when the l key is pressed what was the last disco disco the sharks will do a disco move all right so we're ready for our dance off ready set go all right all right macklemore ben more body roll more body roll all right so you could see a fun danceoff we didn't by the way one of the cool things we could do is we can actually make an entire world of dancers come be around us and i didn't show this but you can have like 20 different people off in the background to make this which is like our entire audience of bears in the background but i want to do a quick audience vote to see who was the better dancer between sophia's cat and hottie's shark so who won the dance off this is going to be a tight one oh wow vote for me don't vote for my daughter oh man all right let's share the results i think sophia won the dance off you guys are my favorite all right uh we have just a little bit of time uh ben we're gonna do a quick lightning round of questions before we say goodbye to ben so ben what we've done uh each week our special guest gets 60 seconds to ask some very short questions and your goal is to give good answers but as as quickly as possible to see who can answer the most questions and our record so far is uh nine questions were answered by sal khan of khan academy so that's the record to beat to get a high score you ready yep sophie you're ready go your favorite article of clothing jeans your favorite smell clone an activity you can easily get sucked into for hours video games a country you've always wanted to visit but haven't canada the first thing you've ever bought on your own with your own money the first thing the song you know all the words too uh can't hold us something you wish you could have learned as a kid uh what adjective is what are your feelings about pineapple on pizza love it what can always make you laugh my wife something you can eat every day pizza with pineapple favorite drink water as a kid what do you want to be when you grow up musician best book you've ever read the giver yes okay wow ben got our new high score of 13 questions 60 seconds uh i was sweating there just watching how quickly i was really trying to beat the record i don't you know i mean i love canada but that's not true i just wanted to beat the record you're just just throwing words and answers out there to go fast all right that's awesome well thank you ben and i know ben's short on time so thank you so much for spending time with us on code break and can we give ben a quick round of applause and if we could put the audience in gallery mode to all say goodbye to ben thank you so much uh thank you guys so much for having me it was awesome awesome thank you so much bye byebye see you guys and before we welcome our next special guest one thing i wanted to point out that sophie and i were wearing code.org gear that we sent you an email if you want to get a dance party shirt with the dance characters or a code like a girl shirt like sophia's got or the code hat or the code earrings these are all available if you want to get any of those they're available at amazon and if you want to find the link to our store you can go to code.org shop or you can just search for them on amazon you can search for code.org shirts and find those i would like to have our next special guest join us uh is scott forstall on yet i am all right hi there scott how are you doing hey i'm doing great considering we're all locked at home right now i'm doing okay where are you calling us from uh northern california yeah silicon valley awesome well yeah it's been a tough it's been a tough time being all here at home alone and and trying to deal with life on zoom and video conferencing scott is a dear friend i i met scott when i was i think 18 and you must have been 19 when we were both summer interns at microsoft and scott went on to join apple and has been the inventor and creator of many of the technologies many of us use the most famous of which being the iphone and ios so it's just such an honor to have you uh on to talk to talk to us about your experience learning about computer science and computer programming and so on um before we get into that i wanted to do a very quick trivia question it's trivia time so our trivia question if we're going to put this poll up on screen is the question is what was the very first mouse the first computer mouse made of the options are metal wood and plastic and you can see everybody's making their guesses metal wood or plastic for a computer mouse wow it's kind of a tight vote yeah so we scott do you know the answer yourself uh the first one i ever saw was made of wood all right so let's share the audience results everybody thinks the first computer mouse was made of wood that is not the guess that i would have made but let me share the answer if you see on my screen the very first computer mouse was made of wood and it looks incredibly clunky and you can see this little wheel it could really kind of not go in so many directions um and the reason it was called a mouse this is showing it next to the first one of the first computers and you can see the little string coming out of the back of the mouse mouse's computer mouses were not wireless they used to have a little wire and the wire coming out of the back of it is why we even call it a mouse because it looked a little bit like a mouse uh all right that's it for trivia times so scott i want to talk a little bit about your background um and while scott is talking i also want to share people can at any point if you have questions for scott or myself uh you can go to code.org questions to to submit a question to ask scott at the end of the episode so um the other thing i want to say is while scott and i are chatting i want the students who are on camera those are you on scam camera and if you're at home as well take a piece of paper and sketch out your design for the home screen of a phone of the future so we have somebody who designed the most popular phone that that we're all using the iphone and ios but imagine the phone of the future if you could skip past the idea of a phone with just a bunch of icons of apps and make up your own screen for the home screen on your phone what would it be on later on we're going to share some of these designs with scott and see what he thinks so scott i'd like to hear a little bit about your childhood i know you had some pretty challenging circumstances growing up can you share about basically what it was like growing up how you got into computer science and how that helped you effectively build a better life for yourself yeah definitely um you know when i was a kid uh we moved up to washington and when we got there we didn't have anywhere to live uh and so my my parents found a friend who convinced their neighbor to let us live at their place for a while and when that when that ended and we had to leave we moved into uh a tent in a park and so for a while our family like we were leaving this this tent and i remember we had to uh like walk down the road to the shared bathroom it had a shower and you had to pay for hot water and it cost 25 cents for two minutes of hot water i heard my dad uh declaring that we had enough money for 50 cents per week for my older brother and me to take showers uh so each of us got one quarter uh and could take a two minute hot water shower and the very first time i went down there this is uh up in seattle it's west of seattle it's uh fall so it's really cold i hopped in the shower i'm soaping up two minutes pass really fast when you're a little kid in a shower and suddenly it was ice cold water coming out and and i had soap all over and it was way too cold so i hopped out i dried off and for a week i had just soap drying on me uh which is not great for your skin not great for you at all uh so next week i figured out a better way of doing it which is get a little wet get all the soap on jump in for two minutes to rinse off but let me tell you when when that kind of thing happens it is it is a formative experience uh i said to myself i never want to to reach a point as an adult where i'm living in a tent and so the way to guarantee that was through education like there was no doubt you know i had to go i wanted to concentrate on my education get a great education all through elementary school high school college beyond and that'd be the way out now when i look back on it i think that we probably could have done more than we were doing at the time with my parents and they were very frugal but you know for a for an eightyearold uh what you see is like you go home from school and you end up in this tent so it's really cool just to imagine i mean right now in america there's millions of people who are homeless and globally hundreds of millions of people who are homeless and especially during this pandemic period when school is closed uh the children don't have a place to go you know there's not a home that they're staying at necessarily and to think that there's eightyearolds out there right now that might be homeless that one of them might invent the next iphone uh is just an interesting thing to think about and how important education is to give all of them the opportunity to to to basically have a track like unit or just even the opportunity to get a great job right now education is the way and again i i did not have the experience that so many people out there having that are homeless uh and uh and the experience right now with the pandemic which is so difficult where people can't even see their friends in person uh is really really hard and so you know thank goodness for the technology that we've had created over the last five ten years that's made this a little more doable but still uh it is it is very very difficult for people out there and you uh can you tell us a little about you've basically got him to a pretty good college and then got recruited by steve jobs can you tell us about the story about how that happened yeah yeah so so yeah i got into a great college and took out a huge number of loans and i couldn't afford the school without a lot of loans and that i worked the entire time i was in college and when i when i finished my graduate work uh there were two places i was looking i was looking at microsoft where i had been an intern with you and and others and uh at next and next was the computer company that steve jobs had started when he left apple and uh i i was pretty interested in both i mean next i thought had amazing technology uh and amazing people did not have a lot of customers unfortunately but had a great technology so i went to this interview they'd set up and it was an intense interview it was like 17 people throughout the course of an entire day and i was in the very first interview and i was maybe 10 minutes into this interview and steve jobs burst into the room and he grabbed the person who was interviewing me and took them out to the hallway which was behind me and they were having this really animated discussion just like talking and something was happening that was big and i was waiting and waiting and waiting for my interview to continue and eventually i heard the door open and my interview came back in but it wasn't the person who had been interviewing me it was it was steve jobs and he just started peppering me with question after question after question and after about 15 minutes we really we really clicked on design philosophy and a bunch of other things he stopped he looked at me and he said i know you have to interview for the rest of the day i don't care what anyone says uh at the end of the day i'm giving you an offer uh and then he said but please you know pretend you're interested in everyone's questions throughout the rest of the day and uh and and then he looked at me and he said and i'm sure you're gonna you're going to accept this offer so this is his way to convince me now i had an offer from microsoft so i called up microsoft or you know one of my contacts there uh and turned down their offer and the next day when i woke up and i opened the door to my apartment there was a box outside i opened it up and it was a dead fish it was this huge dead fish and i looked at the box and had a return address of microsoft this seems like a threat uh i i call i called up my contact at microsoft and i said like uh you know i've watched movies with the mafia and uh i know that when you send someone a dead fish you're trying to to scare them what message are you sending and they said no no no no we we're trying to convince you to come to seattle to microsoft and so the moment you said no we rushed down to the pike place market which is that place in seattle where they throw fish around and they bought the largest king salmon they could find and they packed it in ice and overnighted it to me and so this was to try to convince me i guess that you know there's no fish i'd be able to buy in the bay area uh and to come back to seattle um which is very funny i i cooked the fish that night on a barbecue it was delicious but i ended up going and working with steve jobs for the next 20 years that's awesome well thanks for sharing that story uh it's always amazing to hear about different people's pathways and to to start from a tent to end up working for steve jobs at apple is pretty cool we want to move into the last segment of our episode today which is learning we've been learning about events and we want to learn about using events in apps we're going to do this with my son darius who's going to sit down next to me hi hey darius darius is 13 and he's a big fan of the iphone he has an iphone that he's pretty psyched about uh what we're going to do is we're going to use code.org app lab to design an escape room app and first of all i want to talk about their use of events in in making apps events play a key role for designing user interface when you're designing an app part of the design is the look and feel but actually the more important part is the intro activity anytime a user clicks or types or does anything that generates an event and the interactivity comes from the code that you write to the event handler that manages what happens when that event happens uh while i get open up app lab scott have you done escape rooms before i love escape rooms actually it's one of the things my family is quite addicted to uh we do there's some great ones in san francisco uh palace games is amazing and they even have some online ones and then every time we travel to a given city we find an escape room to do so an escape room for anybody who's not familiar is basically a room that you need to get out of by solving a puzzle we're going to make one of these inside app lab i'm sharing my screen right now and we've actually started this off a little bit to get part of it you know to get the high level design work and then we're going to write some of the code for it so what you see here is a room with a door and a picture and a safe and i'm going to start running it to just see the starter code what it does so if you click run and i'm going to guess that there's something inside the safe so if i click the save you see a prompt that says enter the code but i don't know what code to enter so i'm not sure what's going to happen so we need to write some code here that says on the event that the safe is clicked we're going to prompt the user to enter the code and store that in the variable guess and then here it says if yes equals something we can show the inside of the safe so it's scott what would be a good code for for people to have to guess uh darius's birthday is brilliant during his birthday is that a safe code [Laughter] no let's go uh with uh 1986 9286 that's nobody's birthday so now if you type 9286 here's click run oh geez what just happened i think we might have done a reload okay here we go that was lucky um so if we if we click run and if we click the safe it asks for the code and we say 9286 and we hit ok it shows the inside of the save that's because this code here that says if the guest was 9286 show the inside of the save but we also want to show something else you can see there there's sort of a hidden key so darius can you pick the show element block it's a little bit farther down over here show element and drag it in there so that in besides showing the inside of the stick we also show the key here yeah now uh when we do that we can click run and then click on the safe and then type 9286 and hit ok and that shows the key but how is somebody gonna know that the code is 9286 uh we can hide that code somewhere where would you like to hide it darius under the painting we could put it under the painting so i'm gonna put it behind the painting so i'm going to go in design mode and this is painting is basically an image object if i move it back i can go here and there is going to type the 9286 over here all right so we have that in that little label there but we're going to hide it behind the painting again but then we can write code again for what happens if you click we can unhide the code and we also have this in our starter code so it says on event that the picture is clicked set its position somewhere so do you want to change and pick a new position for the picture when we click it we can change its position the top left will be good all right so you want to pick an x and y 20 and let's try 20 20. and notice when you put your mouse over there on the screen it shows the x and y of different spots if you're not sure so now click the run button and after you click the painting you can see the code 9286 now we can escape the room by using the safe click on the safe and you can enter that code that you got from the painting and now it shows the key and then what happens when we click on the key we need something for that too so now we need an event for what happens when we click the key so to create that event uh go and click and choose another event block at the top you see on event and now we're using events on the event that the key is clicked so choose the key now we want to move the key as well so make another set position block and let's move the key to the let's say to the bottom left of the screen so can you hide around the bottom left of the screen and i want to ask the audience where would it what would be the x and y location for making the bottom of the screen so let's show the poll for the audience to guess that so what should x and y be equal to so we have the options of x of 30 and y of 400 x of 400 y of 30 x of 30 y of 30 x of 400 y of 400 i think the second one might be a typo on our parts all right so if we could share the results of the guesses the most popular guess is x is 30 and y is 400. now this is something i want to share in math class the bottom left would be kind of the small x and a small line when you're looking at computers the x of 0 and y of 0 is of the upper left whereas in math x of 0 and y of 0 is in the bottom left scott do you remember why for computers the y of 0 is at the top and not the bottom uh well turns out it actually depends on the coordinate system of your view system at the time so different ones have different places uh i guess i don't remember the the reason that in general it starts top left yeah so it's actually something whoever makes the operating system can decide so whenever you made ios you chose how that coordinate system would work the historical way reason is because computer screens used to have a sort of cathode ray tube and there was a scan that would actually individually draw the pixels and it would draw them like when you read a book from the top to the bottom and so that was the first why uh so but everybody's guess was right so let's put the key position to go to 30 and 400 so when you click the key it's going to move to 30 and 400 and then once the key is out if you look a little bit lower in this code it says if the door is clicked the door doesn't usually open unless the key is in the right spot because if you click on the door it says if the position of the key is something show something so let's set that so that uh if the key is at 30 at the x position is at 30 what should we show click the show element it's got a little drop down there uh let's show the outdoors that'll open the door so if the key has been clicked then we can finally open the door so now let's hit run to see how this works so first you need to click the painting to get our secret code now we got the code we can open the safe by entering 9286. now we got the key click the key all right now that the key is out of the safe we can click to open the door awesome so now we escape the room on this yeah so i have a question so when the the key moves to the bottom and then you have to click the door to open it that seems a little confusing to me uh i mean it seems to me that you want the key when you click on it from the safe to actually open the door you want the action of the key to be to move to the door and open it uh because it doesn't seem we always throw it on the floor and that's how we do it right you trying to pull the key on the floor to open the door isn't that the normal way that's if it's uh you know the kids clothes that they're not putting the hamper so you're saying let's have the key move to the door when you click it yeah i think you can simplify this a lot by moving the key directly to the door all right so let's have the key when you click it set the position and do you want to have to click the door or do you want the door to just automatically open i think you could do either i think you could either have it so when the key goes to the door it opens the door or when the key is on the door now it's unlocked and if you click either the key or the door the door opens right which one do you want to do there is i want to do the way we already have oh yeah less work for outfits to make it the way we already have so click run all right you can't open the door yet try opening the door it doesn't work try opening click the picture you see from using code we know we know the code it's 9286 now click the key and now the key goes to the right place a nicer place and now you can open the door although i'm not sure why it's not working there you go awesome all right because the key icon is probably larger with alpha yeah the key icon is covering parts of the door so maybe your way would have been better to make the door automatically open up so we're going to share out this app for people to basically make their own escape room app and i want to give an example of something that somebody else made this is a slightly more complicated escape room using very much the same code that we wrote so you can do something more innovative you don't need to use the same code but we are here in a kitchen with a fridge and a microwave and the microwave is asking us for a code uh which we don't know but if you click this little thing it gives you this code of 968692 and then i can type this 8692 code and the microwave has a key inside and if i click it the fridge opens to show another room and if i click i can go into this other room which in app lab is changing the screen so now there's a door and there's a mat there's nothing under the map there's a safe but i bet i need a code for that if i click the clock it says nope but if i click the code rack it shows me the code 5248 so i can now type that in here 5248 and now i get another key and i click that and it opens the door to get me out so you can make more and more complicated escape rooms if you'd like but that's the challenge that we're going to send you for for after today's code break is done so one thing i want to talk about before we finish you know thank you for helping us with that app scott i wanted to ask a little bit more about the importance of design and asking you a little bit about the initial days of working on the iphone what are the some of the challenges you faced what are some of the design things you needed to get past and and how did you work through them yeah uh when we started the iphone uh we were building something totally different than anything we'd ever seen before and so the important thing about everything we always built at apple is we started with design so we didn't start with technology technology is in service to other things but it is not the end goal and so when we were building the phone uh the biggest design decision we had was making a touch screen which we were already working on a tablet project and so we started using that technology for it but we want to be touch and then there's the question of the keyboard and that was the hardest problem of the entire project is can we make a keyboard that's not physical buttons because at the time all the phones out there had physical buttons right so like the blackberry had these little teeny tiny plastic buttons and that took up half the screen and so you only get another half the screen for you know to see things and half the front of the face of the device is is a keyboard all the time even when you're not using it and so we wanted to make the entire thing into a display but it meant we had to have a keyboard that could work uh and it was unclear if that was possible we we bet on it and you know we're going we're maybe a year into the project and the keyboards weren't working yet uh and this is the important thing like design is about both the the visuals and the usability and so we're about a year in and i paused all work on software on all the applications on all of the designs and we spent 100 of our time just working on keyboards to try to find a solution and uh people came up with crazy design you know sliding designs and and you know pie shape designs uh and some of them worked really well but they'd be incredibly hard to to learn and it's important to know that when you're designing something you might understand it in your head because you've created it but someone else when they're new to it are gonna struggle to understand where you're coming from so we wanted to have something that looked natural and that's why we came up with the standard keyboard and found sort of artificial intelligence ways of having it understand what you meant to type even if your finger didn't touch exactly on that button on the screen so that was one of the biggest risks one of the hardest design things we did that worked out well we also had you know lots of discussions about how many buttons physical buttons should be on the front of the phone and there there's there are arguments for like four buttons three buttons zero buttons uh and we ended up with that one button and the reason was we we didn't want people to be afraid of going into any of the apps and we didn't want them ever to feel like i'm lost i don't know how to get back somewhere and so with a single button it's very easy if you're ever confused if you ever feel uh uneasy you press that button you get back to the home screen it's a known location and you know twoyearolds could figure this out and literally when we shipped it there's twoyearolds using this thing and this was a oneyearold one here there you go one of the earliest photos of him as a oneyearold with the very very first iphone which i bought the very day it came out so yeah can we switch to gallery mode and i want to have the students on screen who drew their own designs for phones to share those and scott if you don't see all these if if you see only me you can click this button in the upper right hand side of zoom i see everyone from folks so you can choose one that you like so pick one of these that you think is uh interesting to talk through and and to to hear from the students i'm trying to see kofi can you hold yours up a little closer and you can move the right and left buttons to see more examples from other folks as well uh i'm going to suggest nick and reim because that's a really cool yeah the nikkei marine it has lots of color and so yeah let's let's see theirs can we um mute and have you show us your design and talk us through what you made and can we switch to speaker view i'll go first um so pretty much my phone design what i made it was it was um like uh poly glass so like plastic glass and it would all this the whole screen would be seethrough and these two parts these two components would be metal and they would project onto the glass and then i sort of had all the apps i had the main apps that you use the most are your like favorite apps bigger than all the rest and then yeah the battery would be at the bottom here and what else and then the banner for your notifications would be at the bottom and then you have the home screen sliding up sort of like the iphone x and the iphone 11 you would slide up you've designed not just a home screen but an entire new phone there you have the charging mechanism and everything that's great and did your sister make a design too where are you all calling from by the way uh calgary canada you got it honestly i just liked mythical unicorns so i made a phone just for girls [Laughter] all right that's the one one thing that i like about that one thing people forget when doing design is to make it actually fun and engaging too often things become very perfunctory and very boring and so designing something that is both fun to use and approachable and accessible is a is a great uh design point all right well what i'd love to do is to have the audience if anybody submitted questions for scott akira do we have any questions from the audience that we can ask of scots hello yes we do um so we have a handful of questions today actually one for scott and one for hottie so um scott we have austin c from mountain view california and he said how have the liberal and or creative arts influenced how you think about coding and computer science oh that's a fantastic question uh i i think that the liberal arts are critical to designing anything i mean apple we always talked about sitting at the intersection of engineering and the liberal arts i mean i personally uh have been producing broadway musicals as well i mean i i think that that when you bring that creativity in everything you do when you're building uh an application is design work and be it design your code to designing the user experience to designing the interactivity it's it's all design and so the more versed you are in the liberal arts the better read you are the more you know plays you've seen in books you've read the better equipped you are to build more interesting products and also the better equipped you are to understand more cultures and since we live in this very interconnected global community now uh by understanding different cultures different from your own you can build products that will work better for people that are unlike you and one thing by the way in today's day and age of artificial intelligence and machine learning the importance of learning liberal arts and humanities is not only for the design but also for the ethics of how your code is being used and how it's going to impact society at a grander scale because some of the technologies coming out are really changing society yeah and i think it's critical for all of us who are building these products to consider ethics with every decision all right cure did you have another question uh yes the last one was for you hadi um so we have it from akshata in bengaluru in india and they said i want to help my people in schools and in my country learn computer science what can i do to help them i'm not sure what age they are but what general advice do you have that's a wonderful question well if they have internet connectivity whether on mobile phones or on computers you can use the courses at code.org and if you visit code.org there's a button called teach which is for people who want to be teachers and we've designed that mostly for people in regular schools but people are using the code.org courses in after schools or home schools or basically making their own student clubs uh if if this is for students who don't have computers there's actually unplugged activities a lot like what we did with with ben hagerty with macklemore earlier making the dance moves there's all sorts of unplugged activities that that people can do and those are also you look for the unplugged course it teaches basic computer concepts like uh events like loops like algorithms in an unplugged manner and you can use those in your community there's over a million teachers around the world teaching using code.org classrooms and you can become a young teacher in india or anywhere you want yeah and let me put a plug in i've actually used the code.org materials to teach at boys and girls clubs before and the materials are fantastic and right now when people are sheltering at home is a perfect time to learn computer science it is a perfect time it's such a great thing to learn while you're at home uh so we're wrapping up our episode uh and one thing i want to say is if you want to continue your learning we're going to email you this week's challenges if you aren't on our email list go to code.org break and sign up and we'll send you the code for to basically learn to make your own dance party or to make your own escape room app uh if you want to come back on next week to share what you've created you can have your mom and dad share what you create on social media with hashtag codebreak or you can email them to us directly and also the thing i want to say is these challenges always include an aspect that can be done on a smartphone if you don't have a computer or even without a device and lastly don't forget to go to code.org shop to get either a cool hat or tshirt like word we're wearing so thank you scott so much for being this week's special guest it was an honor and privilege to have you on with us next i'll be happy to be here it's great yes thank you you're so gracious with your time next week our special guests are going to be the actress kat graham and the australian singer cody simpson it's going to be a particularly neat episode as we talk about ai and machine learning and the ethics and computing if you enjoyed today's episode please invite other friends and families to join us i want to give an extra special thanks to scott can we switch to gallery mode and everybody can wave goodbye to scott uh thank you scott uh and for everybody who's at home uh if you're studying alone take a code break and we'll see you all next week bye so so
