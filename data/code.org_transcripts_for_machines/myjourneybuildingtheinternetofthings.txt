good morning everyone my name is pat young praditt and i'm co.org's chief academic officer welcome to cs journeys class chats my journey building the internet of things i'm so excited to be with you all today i'd like to introduce our speaker wale oliday hin uh from amazon wallet uh hi have you um could you introduce yourself your role at amazon and also tell us a little bit about what you'd like to do outside of work awesome awesome pat really excited to be here today too so my name is wale oladahin everyone calls me wale i am actually the head of solution architects in internet of things so connecting you know devices and you know assets to the cloud um so i've been at amazon for seven years uh and funny enough outside of technology i actually was a uh dancer um i'll share some photos but i uh was a professional salsa dancer for several years so that's me dancing in istanbul and uh also dancing with one of my partners uh and then before that i was actually a breakdancer so you know outside of work having something fun to do beyond just you know sitting behind a keyboard wow uh yeah i don't know how many salsa dancers or break dancers are out out there in the in the audience but um you know you know what because you're a salsa dancer i gotta tell you uh i have tried salsa dancing in the past and i rate his weakness is my timing i just keep timing down like i i see it done and i feel the music but my timing is just off so ballet i was thinking could you uh show me just the basic movements and maybe like a turn as well yeah and actually uh students out there classes out there whoever is watching i actually uh would love it if you would join us yes that's right so students are like looking at each other [Laughter] like whoa i wasn't expecting this but yes this morning you're going to learn how to do a little salsa dancing so yes you can you move get out of your desk yeah i'm already standing okay that's okay kids i know you're looking at each other you look at the teacher teachers please allow them to do it go ahead and stand up and uh okay pat i i just i just grabbed some some sauce of music let's see let's see how this goes the secret with the timing is it's one two three pause on four five six seven so we're gonna start with your right leg i'm gonna set my right leg out you can't see it as much and then you're gonna go to your left leg so think one two three five six seven and then it's easier to see my arms but your arms almost do a little bit of a figure eight all right one smooth okay one yeah three pause five six seven okay and then you finish it off with a turn five six seven do you step forward and then turn one two three pause five six seven you got it and then the finale with the turn yeah you did it nice we got to give pat a round of applause for that look at that two of them great i'm here all week wow so um so amazon uh world war head of worldwide solutions architects at amazon as well as professional salsa dancer now the break dancing now i'm not gonna even go there so everyone's kids are probably really interested in that as well but we don't have the uh probably the space for them the space [Laughter] right so well i think thanks for uh letting us know a little bit about your role and also what you do outside of work you know i'm curious what role does computer science play in your career and if you could also give us an example of a project a recent project that you all have worked on that involves computer yeah science think i think it's really interesting um so i studied computer science when i went into college and i i think you know i started programming actually in the fourth grade um and even today what's really interesting is you know computer science leaves you with a lot of great theories and those theories exist you know they last today as they will 20 years from now 30 years from now so when you learn things like for loops and if statements and while loops like what you're really learning is what are things that are repetitive what might require you to take a different condition or action based on input you have so i find that programming has helped me not only make better decisions with the architectures that i design or my team designs but also how we think about like the the way to get to success um i'll share my screen again but a really good example of that is you know my last really cool project i worked on um amazon has like the like wind farms that they're like a large energy movement on sustainability and we actually worked with the amazon you know wind energy team to basically say how do we optimize you know the wind farms how do we look at an individual wind turbine understand speed velocity rotation braking that happens that's required to make sure that you can kind of capture the most capture energy efficiently and all of this is run by the same kind of concepts you know if you have a certain type of weather condition then you do this if you have really great weather and low winds then you do something else so all that programming still comes into play today wow that's um it's really cool i didn't i didn't even know that amazon was into wind farming like that um can you um tell us you know you're you're again you're the head uh head of this head of worldwide solutions architects at amazon uh when it comes to the internet of things uh can you tell us what the internet of things actually is yeah it's really interesting you know like we i if you told me i was going to be a solution architect in iot you know when i was in you know middle school high school like i don't know what any of those things are they didn't really exist in the same way they do today but think about the internet of things as you know smart home if you have a smart thermostat even if you're into gaming you know a lot of gaming consoles if you want to get the latest game update these are devices that are connected to the internet and then solution architects like what my team does is i have a team of 40 people around the world and they help customers connect these type of devices to the internet so think of customers like if you've got a vizio tv they're a big customer of ours you can kind of catch them on youtube talking about how it's easy to connect tvs and you know help people get a better viewing experience so we work with customers around that to kind of solve the the things part of the internet of things wow so okay so there's um lg with their refrigerator right yeah uh um and then all of i mean i guess you uh all the echo devices are things that connected to the internet correct yeah exactly yeah and you think like if you've got a roomba in your house and it's kind of cleaning that's a thing um and then you can even look at things like how do you get a package to your door you know when someone's routing a delivery package they normally have a tablet in their hand and that's also a thing to help them figure out where is the most optimal route to help deliver your amazon package so it lots of things are connected which is which is a fun space to be in yeah and they're all and they can also talk to one another they're not just um it's not just one way to some to some computer somewhere or to yeah they can they can communicate with one another and coordinate i guess right yeah exactly yeah it's very it's very funny i've i've done it throughout my entire house but it's great i can kind of you know when it's time for bedtime i could just say like you know echo alexa it's time for bed and the lights go off i've got a smart lock the smart lock locks and it's just you know it's all automated so that's the fun part um for sure wow so you you already mentioned how you've been you never thought that you'd be into the internet of things the internet things that didn't even really exist when you were in high school can you tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today and who were the people who helped you along the way yeah pat that's a really cool question um i i i'll start with how i got to where i am today um and i'll say i think the fun thing for me is that i i if you notice in my name i'm nigerian um so you know when my parents kind of came here to the states it was just it was just assumed that i was either going to be a doctor or a lawyer like that's what you just like nigerians like you're going to be a doctor you're going to be a lawyer um my my father was a doctor uh but i i can't handle i can't handle blood or anything like i have a very queasy stomach so i was like clearly i can't be a doctor um but i started falling in love with programming when i was really young so i started doing programming and then as i got a little bit older i really got into sports i grew up in tennessee i was a big volunteers fan so peyton manning was a volunteer so i was like really into football and i was also really into basketball uh and you can't see me but i'm only like five five five and i thought i was going to play in the nba and um my my dad kind of came to you know help me set reality that i probably wouldn't be too tall um look up muggsy bogues he played in the nba he's my height but i love sports um and i started getting into math again and i had to figure out how i could do both um so i went to school and i studied computer science but then i also started doing things to just keep my athletic passion going like dance and i've kind of used both of those skill sets to be in a position where as a solution architect you don't just do a lot of coding you also help like explain these concepts it's kind of like you're you're an artist in a sense you're trying to help people understand and articulate strategy and you've got to engage them in the right way so that's kind of how i've gotten to where i am today um i think there's been a lot of people who have helped me there two people that really stand out one was my professor in college like he was a great mentor to me uh his name is uh brian kerningham and i i did bring a picture of him as well but if the name sounds kind of familiar uh brian kerningham actually wrote the first programming book so if you go back into the archives a long time ago and say what was one of the first programming books i've ever written it was by brian kerningham on the c language and he really taught me how to think differently and how to apply those programming concepts kind of out into the real world so he's definitely one of the people who stand out sent out to me uh the most wow and who's the other the second yeah funny enough i'd actually say i really like to have people kind of as i start out and then as i get a little bit a little bit older i will give a plug to my third grade teacher i was i was thinking about this a little bit uh mrs bond uh and what was funny is i i didn't start programming until i was in the fourth grade but mrs bond was like you know you you should really you have a very like analytical thinking like i was really good at math at the time and she's like you should do this thing called computers like it's kind of new we don't have that many like you should go do it and so she was definitely one of my inspirations in starting like my curiosity at a young age um and then i i brought one other person uh who's been my mentor more recently and it's this gentleman in the middle um this is a podcast show we're doing here at work but the person in the middle is actually james gosling um and if you don't know who james gosling is he wrote java so if you know the java programming language it runs on everything it runs on your androids uh tablets and things like that he is the inventor of it so he's actually been a more recent uh mentor for me and it's been it's been great to pick his brain about you know being any internet and being in programming when you know there was only 10 or 15 people doing it [Laughter] wow wow yeah you're very fortunate um you know i wanted to remind our participants that they actually can ask questions by using the the q a feature so please feel free folks out there to ask your students if they have any questions and then type them into the q a and we'll try to address them as we go here um so uh what what while i you talked about people helping you along the way and how you got to where you are today what obstacles have you faced along the way and and how you dealt with those obstacles yeah i think i think there's a couple interesting obstacles i would say um growing up i did grow up in a very small town so i i think you know i grew up in the south um one of the obstacles i had was when i got into college i i didn't give a name but i went to princeton university it's you know it's a prestigious school and there's all these famous names there um but one of my obstacles was like i didn't feel like i actually fit in in that world like i was like wow i'm surrounded by um there was someone in my class who was like the number two fence fencer like olympic fencer in the world and we had people going to the olympics for swimming and all these things and you know i sat at a computer and programmed and i danced um and so i always felt like i didn't necessarily fit in or maybe my skill set wasn't the right one and so one of the things i've had to consistently overcome is understanding that like my unique background being brings something to the table and i have to be a little bit more kind of open to the experience i've had and that they have you know value for others so that's something i think kind of going through my academic years has been a challenge um i would say more recently in this kind of global world i have a really large team and you know there's people in korea and people in europe and people in the americas and understanding that that all of them have a different kind of cultural experience and making sure that all of their voices are heard and all of their thinking is kind of brought together and so it's kind of come a little bit full circle for me in some of the challenges i face today wow that's um that's really good advice i i know that uh you know as adults you're talking about yourself at princeton you were an adult already and even now and even me now as an adult uh you know you sometimes look at other people and you think oh they're so smart or whatever what do i have to contribute and you forget that it's not about like just about being smart as much as like people bring different skill sets uh and very unique experiences to uh to a situation and you know students out there all of you all of you are bringing something unique to a situation and sometimes the the problem is not trying to be smart or be like everyone else the problem is trying to figure out how to use your unique experiences and be in a situation um where you you know you can use that use uh use those special characteristics that you have yeah we have a question actually from uh nicole west high what advice wale would you give to students who are just getting started in their first computer science class and what classes should we should they take or a side projects to try out awesome um this is a really good question i i um when you first start out in like computer science and programming most of the time you do you know like what i call the happy path like everything works you you copy and paste everything exactly right you compile it nothing happens which is normally a good sign and then you run it um what i found really helpful is i actually tell people you know make some mistakes on purpose so once you have the perfect you know program and you've written your you know your function or your object correctly go in and do things incorrectly because what it's going to help you understand is like what happens when things don't go as planned um when you get into like you know the internet i work in amazon web services so the cloud like all these data centers and things like that our motto is everything fails all the time so if you start taking your programs and understand okay what happens when this thing fails what message do i get you actually get a lot more experience with the same thing you've been writing um and i i think for side projects as well you should do something you're passionate about like you want a side project that challenges you but you're also really interested in my first side project in the fourth grade i was very much into snoopy uh so the character stupi so i did a lot of like graphic animations of snoopy i'd have him like walk around and like get on top of his his doghouse and like so but it was fun for me like i loved seeing the output of what i was doing so find something you're passionate about and then it'll also kind of lead you to additional learnings yeah i would add that oftentimes teachers are assigning projects and you in students you're completing these projects uh probably just fine or you know or maybe you know not so fine either way it's an opportunity for you to kind of personalize what what that project is so while a maybe a teacher had a sign for you all to um i don't know just create some art or create uh do a particular animation or something like that and you decided to personalize it by animating snoopy in the same way kids um you know if if you're doing some kind of like math operator calculation boolean logic project uh there's no reason that potentially you could turn it into um something that i always think about like something to do with uh like like shoot like shoes or clothes i'm not saying i think about shoes or clothes [Laughter] uh whenever i think about those projects i think of like oh what how can i turn that project into something that might help me pick clothes or make my life easier you know like a clothes and shoe matcher something like that who knows you know we have another question from adam do you have any advice for our class we're a grade 11 computer programming class and working on working on our final project using construct.net so i don't know if you're familiar with that you can here we can uh go ahead and i'm gonna open it up in a tab yeah i think it's um i wanna say it's funny i work with our gaming team every so often i want to say like if i recall correctly it's in gaming um i remember a little bit as well like i think this is one of the interesting parts because like you you you won't know all languages you run into so when we go back to computer science it's grounding yourself in the fundamentals like i was mentioning earlier um and so for things like construct if i remember correctly they're kind of browserbased job like javascript type applications so like some of the things i look at not knowing your final project but what would be really interesting is you know javascript has a lot of when i talk about kind of things that um you can experiment with javascript does things like you can run things parallel you can run things serially you can do things like um you know set an event and then catch an event and so as you think about the gaming experience like think about interesting things you can do in that kind of event loop in in javascript so say like well you know what i was doing before is playing sound but what if i decided to in that event not just play sound but also make you know changes to the score on the fly now we kind of call this like dynamic um like dynamic behaviors like that's a really kind of cool concept in gaming like it learns and adapts to your style you can do it in a really simple way today which is just like take these interesting events and do something random with them so maybe instead of just saying well i'm going to give you points in the sound i want to give you you know additional points because it's five o'clock i mean you're doing it right at the end of your day and that just allows you to experiment a little bit as well um javascript's an interesting language i actually ran it at a like a company like a startup with me and my friend um debugging javascript has always been is always been one of the things i struggled with so events have helped me try to you know rationalize what's happening as well okay thanks thanks wale um we have a question about internet of things which actually i had a question as well um you know because uh as a teacher the internet of things um i last taught in like 2013 it started really becoming a thing and i was always curious how could uh how could i get my students exposed to uh that type of programming you know like so like like right now there there are teachers listening to us like while they like how do they i mean with our echo devices can we just go ahead and start coding for them like like how do we how do we get uh beginners involved in the internet of things yeah uh that's that's a really good question too like i um i think there's a couple things you can program your echoes you probably you probably shouldn't they actually take a lot of work like you have to get into the the details of them a bit but what's really interesting is um and maybe pat i can find a way to share this or people can search for it um there's two things um there's this there's this platform called raspberry raspberry pi they're they're great to use like they're very very simple um the other thing that we have amazon actually launched just recently it's called the educate so it's a it's um it's like an mcu a microcontroller so very very small form factor i oh here we go i was like i think i have a test one on my desk so they're very very small form factor and you can actually like order these off of amazon and they teach you the basics of hardware so you'll understand what does a serial port mean to communicate to another um you know part of the device how do you actually do a hello world on a piece of hardware so this is one thing educate's really great um raspberry pi's and most of these have like very simple getting started as well so i'd recommend either one of those to um start learning if you go the educate route 2 there's a whole video series so i'll be happy to find a way to kind of share it with the group uh afterwards okay thanks wale um next question uh you mentioned the importance of making mistakes can you share one mistake you made at your job and what you learned from them oh i make a lot of mistakes um that's a really good question um you know i'll actually talk about uh maybe the mistake i made with i can't name the the customer name but we were doing a we're basically doing a deployment for a customer basically like this is last year but you can think if you're in the kind of holiday season there's lots of customers who need to get products out the door for holidays right you know the the christmas time the right after thanksgiving um and i was actually working with a customer where they were doing millions of devices that they're going to take for holidays and normally when you do millions of devices you you want to have them test above and beyond what they're going to bring um but based on timing we only had like a month and we really needed two to three months to do this work and so i kind of made a decision like let's just test capacity like as close that we can get to for your holidays um so we didn't do what i normally recommend we kind of do a bit of smaller one um unfortunately we basically launched on black friday and they were underwater they were basically like instead of being able to handle everything they could only handle about like twothirds of what they normally could um and this was clearly my mistake i would have told them to delay things or try to escalate and have them add more capacity um so it ended up costing us about two weeks of work afterwards so as soon as this failed we had to basically spend time helping them scale up correctly do a bunch of remediations catching errors around not handling capacity things we could have done earlier but we waited for um that's probably my most recent mistake i find even in those cases like that mistake happened and everyone ended up being okay it cost us a few weeks of time but we're able to still help a customer um so yeah that's probably my most recent one um it's a lot of late nights um in coffee which is not what i normally like to we're do of at the end here i know it went fast uh i i wanted to make sure that you had an opportunity to speak directly to the students um like what do you want them to remember or take away uh from from this class chat and from your experience yeah i mean first off thank you so much like it's uh it's a pleasure just to be in front of everyone and to share my experience um i'd probably say there's there's like maybe one thing that's top of mind for me for people to take away and i kind of talked about my experience of background a little bit um but i i have this like bruce lee quote that sits at my desk um which which basically talks about like you know absorb what is useful discard what is not and then make it uniquely your own and i think the thing that stuck with me the most is making things uniquely my own so you're going to learn a lot of skills you're going to develop your technical capabilities you're going to program more and more but making it your own is what's really important and so always bringing yourself you know into the work that you're doing and into the classes that you're in and i'd also say the other thing i bring there is you know make sure you're working with your your classmates too like i you know it's very easy to kind of work by yourself and do homework by yourself and code and program but the things i've learned the most have been through the people that i've worked with you know in college i had colleagues like peers i worked with really closely in high school i did as well and they just make you a better kind of programmer and developer and a better better person so i hope i leave those two things with you and it's just been an honor and appreciate the time thank you thank you and uh everyone else thank you for joining us uh on code.org cs journeys class chats that was uh wales head of worldwide solutions architects internet of things at amazon thank you for joining us um please visit uh cs journeys and for any more information and to sign up for future class chats thank you
