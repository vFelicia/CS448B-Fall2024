hi everybody and welcome to our final day of computer science education week hi hi this is darius my son and i'm hadi partovi the founder of code.org and the creator of the hour of code this week is computer science education week and all around the world tens of millions of students are getting introduced to coding and computer science and you know the hour of code is something we started about seven years ago in 2013. we were much younger then and you know just in those seven years we've had over 1 billion times has the hour of code been done just this week alone roughly i think about 100 million hours of code have been done just in this past week it's pretty incredible to see an idea that you start in your own bedroom turn into a global phenomenon but here we are and we're excited to close out this week with a lesson on minecraft but before we get into that uh i wanted to first get a sense of where our participants are from so if we could first show up the map that shows where everybody's calling in from that would be great that's amazing all right let's let's stop the screen share and before we get into this lesson one of the questions people have asked is why do we call this code bytes uh does anybody know what a byte is do you know what a byte is yes let's a byte has to do with how computers store numbers do you want to talk about it a little bit don't don't give the answer to how many but what how do computers store numbers well they have numbers stored in bits well actually they have to use binary and what are the bits well bits are like the smallest bits of information and there's a certain number of bits in a byte but i'm not allowed to say that yeah so bits are ones and zeros and so the binary number system lets computers store any form of information using ones and zeroes and a byte is a group of bits and can we put up a poll to see if the audience knows how many bits there are in a byte and if you're answering if you're watching on youtube uh you you won't see this poll as the students are answering so the question is how many bits are there in a byte four bits eight bits 32 bits or 64 bits all right let's end the poll and share the results so about one third of you got the answer right one byte means eight bits of information eight different ones and zeros and with eight bits of information eight ones and zeros you can store any number from zero to 255 using the binary number system there's a whole lot more you can learn about how bits and bytes store information not just numbers but colors shapes images sound and video on computers what's interesting also about the binary number system is it predates computers binary numbers and ones and zeros being used is from really long ago let me show you an example this guy that i'm sharing my screen his name is gottfried leibniz he wrote the math paper that basically described the binary system in 1679. uh yeah why does that one have like yeah i don't know why he has really weird eyes there i don't think those are his real eyes but either way this guy in 1679 so that's about you know 350 years ago he but he didn't invent binary numbers it turns out that binary numbers were being used in egypt 4 000 years ago and in fact the egyptians used hieroglyphics to describe the binary number system so long time before computers were invented people were talking about how to use ones and zeros to represent information anyway that's our fun trivia for the day what we're gonna do today uh for the next about 20 minutes is we're going to dive deep into minecraft coding using the code.org hour of code tutorials and what i'm going to do is show something that i suspect many of you have never seen before we've done you know the minecraft tutorial on code.org is one of the most popular uh activities we've ever created almost 100 million people have tried this 100 million students mainly and you know we've made four different uh activities but this one here the minecraft designer this is the one that darius is going to learn to use and and i don't think you've ever tried this before so this is going to be kind of fun for you no i haven't yep so we're going to get started into this and we're going to try a few different levels in this and then we're going to build our own game so so here's the first level we're going to look at and what we want to do is get the sheep to move and usually you're used to code where you get to get you know one character to move forward turn left turn right move forward repeat right now we're going to write the code for all of the sheep sorry all the chickens in with one set of code so if you look here it says chicken when spawned and we've talked about events before the event that happens is when the chicken gets spawned what should they do and the code we put here all the chickens will do so can you write the code that says when spawned move forward and now hit run yay so all the chicken move forward okay hit reset now drag a forever do block and so what this is gonna do is when the chicken and then put that inside there when they're spawned the chicken will all move forward forever all right they got the end of the screen all right now the problem is now we want the chicken to chickens to go in all sorts of different directions so if we want them to move all around let's put up a pole what direction should the should the sheep turn after they move forward you could put up the pole please so the question is should the sheep turn left should they turn right should they turn up should they turn down or should they go in a random direction oh that was too easy of a question we can end this poll because almost everybody got it right if we want the sheep to just wander around they should turn a random direction after every step forward well maybe you should put it before so that they all start out going in random directions sure you can put a that's a good idea good good job all right so now you can hit run and now they are moving in random directions and you can stop this you can also have them uh wait you can have them wait after they move and they'll wait a random amount and you can have them play a sound even if you wanted so now they're just behaving totally randomly and look we just wrote four lines of code those same four lines apply to all the chickens all the chickens are doing the same thing and yet you know with four lines of code that are the same they do different behaviors now let's go to the next level what we want to do here is make the sheep drop wool when you control them and now notice that if you hit run you can use the arrow keys to move up and down and left and right and you can go all the way to the sheep and you can hit the space bar try to get something from him and this isn't really a hard coding level this just says get the sheep to drop the wool when you get to it so and it's not when you touch the sheep or when you reach the sheep it's when you use the sheep using the sheep means hitting the space bar when you're at it so what do you want to do when you get there probably do it drop wool button correct and you want to have a sheet play a sound also sheep bear do you want to play a different sound okay let me see i wouldn't explode that sounds like a sheep sound that's a sheep sound all right yeah so notice the code for moving the player isn't here we're just writing the code for the sheep the code for the player is you know when you hit the up button move up when down move down and so on but that's already built in and now we can use the cursor keys do you want to use the keys to move him to the sheep okay and i hit the space bar and the sheep didn't actually explode you sheared him but it played explode sound that was a really easy level now we're going to get to something slightly more complicated so now check this out we want to get to the sheep but we're blocked by a wall and we need to get this guy which is a creeper to explode the wall and it already has code if you look here that says when you touch the creeper this is the creepers code we're modding the creeper we're modding our own minecraft to say what the creeper is going to do and it says when you touch it it will flash flash wait and then it's going to explode but we want it to explode over here so we need the creeper to get to the wall how do we get the creeper to the wall can we put up the next pole please so to get the creeper to the wall we can use a move command it can move forward it can move backwards but look at this block we have here move a step towards and we can have it go towards whatever we want we can have it come towards the player and then we can basically have it guided by moving the player to the wall all right end the poll please so there's a tie and the actual answer is you could do it both ways you could have the creeper move to the player and then we bring the player to the wall or we can have it go to the sheep so darius what do you want to do you can choose i think you should move towards the player because that's more realistic that should be a forever you know so when the creeper as soon as it's spawned it's gonna forever move towards the player i don't got him and then when when it's touched it's gonna basically explode so good luck because you're going to have trouble staying alive the play is sound yeah when it's touched you're going to play his sound and you want to play an explode sound also yes oh thoroughly set to creeper all right you ready okay good luck controlling this because he's gonna try to destroy you oh no come this way all right no so that's kind of hard do you want to try it the other way yeah that might actually be easier so have a move towards the sheep not the zombie whoops so now he's just gonna go towards the sheep he's not gonna attack you and now you can touch him and then run away run away run away go farther right now you can get to the sheet we're getting all the doughnuts yeah isn't that pretty cool so i'm gonna stop our share for a second what's kind of different about what we've been doing right now is we're not coding the player the code for the player anybody who's used at even basic coding knows is relatively simple the player code is when the up key is pressed move up when the down key is pressed move down when the left key is pressed move left when the right key is pressed move right and when the space key is pressed it's whatever we want it to do because we write the code for that so what we're doing is writing the code for all the other creatures in minecraft and we can write all sorts of rules for them and uh we're gonna do one more level and then we're gonna make our own thing that we can do whatever we want so get ready isn't this cool you haven't seen this before right yeah i knew you'd like it all right so in this level we still are told what we need to do if you see the player is in the middle of this house and he wants to get out but there's creepers outside blocking all the doors but there's this guy over here i don't know if can you tell what that is it's an iron golem it's an iron golem i don't know what that was but thank you uh so what we need is to get this guy to destroy all the zombies so how do we get him to attack the zombies well first you'll need to go towards the zombies forever so when he is spawned he's gonna forever take a step towards the zombies all right and then what should he do one touch does that mean one touched by a zombie or one touched by a block it means when he's touched by anything it's basically if he touches anything yeah you could play you can attack when he's one used when used means when you when when we press the space bar and that's fine if you say if he gets attacked back he can attack he can attack anything that happens to him sure i'll play sound that would break i don't got one you can change the different sounds if you want iron golem hit and you wanna do you wanna have a flash when he's touched or something wow we could have him explode when he's touched yeah you can also have him drop dirt you can do anything you want whenever he gets attacked he'll drop a diamond all right i know ayanna oh yeah cause he's an iron column all right it doesn't look like he's getting attacked it looks like he's attacking them oh he killed one of them but yeah so he's he's going through and killing the other creepers there's zombies sorry killing the zombies sorry i don't know the names of these things so basically what he's doing is forever going towards the zombies and when he touches one of them he's attacking and these zombies i guess are not very aggressive so they weren't attacking him back so all of your code here wasn't running all right so we've now done all of these levels and by the way if anybody wants to try these you go to code.org minecraft and choose minecraft designer and what i want to do is now do the most complex of these which is the last level where we get a giant area we got a huge playing field you know that we can control and we get to make our own game and i want to have the audience decide what game we create so put up a poll we have three choices and again if you're watching this on youtube you aren't on the zoom call but we can save the cheap sheep from the chickens we can play zombies versus creepers we can play tag uret alright it sounds like everybody has a preference uh i had prepared us to play save the sheep from the chickens i was all ready for the chickens to attack the sheep and our job is to just say them but okay let's do zombies versus creepers so we get to decide so hold on let me move some of this stuff around there's there's all this code here but we don't need sheeps and cows on this level i mean we can put some on there but the main code we need is the zombies and the creepers because we're going to have zombies versus creepers so do you want them attacking each other do you want one of them running away from each other i think it's better if like one of them is just moving randomly and then the other one is really bad okay the creeper will just be moving randomly because creepers look kind of random yeah all right so have the creepers when they're spawned do the thing we did with sheep so forever they can turn random wait around wait a bit where is that color you have to scroll down okay wait random they can wait random and then they can move forward all right now one one thing we do when coding is debugging regularly so what happens if we run can we test this or is there any three percent off there's no creepers all right how do we get creepers on there there aren't any trust me okay so hit reset can you figure out how to put creepers the question is when should you put creepers when you run yeah when you hit the run button so when we hit the run button we get yeah we can put whatever we want on the board so you know we could put sheep up there if you put that in the forever do loop there'll be there'll be lots of them no let's not do it let's just put some creepers and you're gonna put them left put put one in the left side and let me show you something you could do you can choose another creeper and put that on the up but click on that block and if you hit ctrl c or command c and then ctrl v or command v you can make a copy of that block like i just did so you can do many of these one in the middle command c command v you can put one on the right hand side of the board that's cool command c command v you can put one on the bottom of the of the of the down you can put on the download on the down of the board yeah thanks for correcting my english so now if you hit run you'll see lots of creepers everywhere and they're going to be moving in random directions they don't do anything yet yeah but you can make them say make move sounds if you want or creeper sounds if you want all right the creepers are just aimlessly walking around what do you want the zombies to do you haven't spawned any zombies but do you want to spawn them first okay when they're spawned they will attack the creepers because that's the point of this code they'll move towards the creepers and then when they get touched what should they do i guess when when they reach a creeper they should attack it right and that's basically when when they touch anything or when they get touched they're to attack when used um is there a zombie hurt sound yeah you can look so when used means when you come to them zombie growl zombie hurts zombie moan so you can have it that when you use them which means playing the space bar so the zombies are gonna play sounds the entire time no that's not right there's gonna be continuous growling if you do it that way but that's okay um it may be better to have them growl when they're attacking maybe if i have a weight short time so they aren't too fast yeah they make it make it very make it very short then so they can you want to make this a little bit aggressive okay um all right what attack they should also play a zombie her sound so we're running out of time so don't don't worry too much about the sounds what should the should or actually should the creepers make a sound when they get attacked it should probably blow up if they get attacked yes so what should happen so when a creeper gets attacked you can have it i'll just have it disappear well then how is he gonna fight the zombies well okay by the way when they're attacked they automatically die gradually too you don't need to do anything to make them disappear if you want you could just have them play a sound and and that code happens automatically i don't think you need to make them disappear you can just have them flash then explode i guess no don't if the creepers explode it's gonna okay you could do it we'll do whatever you want i don't care all right you want to try this or have you forgotten anything um what's the one night when davina no you've oh you just spawned a zombie you have to spawn the zombies well that moved forward your code is a little bit of a mess but now spawn the zombies maybe we should only do two zombies because they're gonna be the ones that attack now your zombies might uh explode when the creepers explode also but all right let's try this and see what happens i don't know how this is gonna work so where are the zombies oh yeah you're right that's very loud what's happening there's zombies somewhere there's a zombie it's fighting a creeper wait how did the fire start and see when they exploded the zombies have both been exploded by the creeper because they kept attacking yay creepers won the creeper is one so do you want to change it so if the creepers don't explode the zombies can do more so let me show you some stuff you could do if you take out the creepers exploding and i know creepers explode don't they that's like the rules of minecraft but we're modding it so we can do whatever we want and so we're going to when the zombies uh i'm gonna take out their sound also so they i'm gonna make them fast so they're gonna move fast towards the creeper i'm gonna take out some of this stuff to make it easier so i made it so there's no exploding and i also want to say it's that when a zombie is attacked or actually when a zombie is used when you come to the zombie you can disappear it so you can fight against the zombies because the creepers don't have any defense so when you attack a zombie it'll just disappear but it'll spawn a new one okay so now we'll get a new zombie that'll show up in the middle of the screen so now your job check it out this creepers forever just moving a random direction they're not doing anything and i'm going to make it so that when they're attacked they'll they'll play like a creeper sound uh they'll hit but otherwise the creepers are moving around helpless but there's two zombies attacking six creepers and you need to save the creepers from the zombies you ready set okay go where are the zombies oh i don't know oh that one's not very smart oh no zombies did the zombie wins all right you got the zombies and now it's nice there's new zombies you're not going to brew nathan all right so this game will keep going because you can never run out of zombies every time you get one a new one spawns so it's a game that goes forever and you know one thing we could have done is that when you get a zombie you can add to your score and you can say every time you get a zombie you get 10 points but what was cool is we just made our own game there's no minecraft rules where the where the creepers don't do stuff and the zombies are the ones attacking them thanks to this minecraft designer we basically decided what the creepers are gonna do what the zombies are gonna do you could have done this to make something a lot more complex you could have the sheep running around you know chasing chickens you could have the chickens attacking the cows you could have zombies that move uh so if any of you out there enjoyed watching that go to code.org minecraft and look at the minecraft designer and try it yourself and see what kind of game you could do and again thank you so much for joining us at this is the last day of computer science education week if you joined late later today we're going to have a different version of the code.org minecraft exploration uh that is going to be run by by one of our curriculum team members and you can also find all sorts of other activities from minecraft if you go to code.org minecraft including a new tutorial that from the minecraft education edition called the tale of two villages that you can play actually inside minecraft itself so thank you so much everybody we're signing off for today have a wonderful computer science education week and thank you for joining us bye bye you
