What's happening everybody? Hey everybody! I'm Russell Okung. I'm an offensive tackle in the National Football League. I was first introduced into computer science when I was in high school. All right, what do we got first? You click on "move left"... Computer science is becoming more and more of a factor in our world and our economy. So there's no better time than now to take advantage. All right, who want's to make the next Facebook? Let's do it! What makes me passionate about computer science education is just the realm of possibilities. Okay well one of you guys is going to show me how to do this. Is that okay? Offscreen I got you! Who? Who said that? You can be a lot more if you focus. If you try things that are outside your comfort zone. I hope you guys want to be entrepreneurs. You want to have your own business. You want to create an opportunity for your family. You want to create your own app or your own platform, or whatever... And I'm here to say today that you can do that. As much as I'm grateful for where I'm at, I realize a lot of people don't get the same opportunity. So I encourage children and people who get into computer science to know that... though it may be difficult your ability to be resilient and persevere through situations can bring you the success you want to see. I'm not scoring though. You're not doing a very good job. (laughs) I'm not doing a good job. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
