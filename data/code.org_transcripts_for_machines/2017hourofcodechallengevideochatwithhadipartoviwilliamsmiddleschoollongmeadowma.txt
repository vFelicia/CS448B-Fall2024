thank you everyone for taking the time out of your day to to chat with us and i'm really excited to uh introduce you all to code.org ceo and founder hattie partovey hi everybody we are so excited that you reached out to us all because of something that nico warren posted and we tweeted at you so thank you so much just in case i don't have an opportunity to say that our first speaker is someone that you actually liked one of her comments this is megan baker hi megan hi oh yes i loved your comment i didn't just like it i love the hour of code so much one weekend at my house i was doing it for two hours and was really disappointed when i accidentally deleted a code i was working really hard when i grow up i would like to work for nasa and i'm sure i will be doing some kind of programming or engineering that is why i love code.org i never really had a connection with other subjects like i do with coding thank you for creating code.org and sharing it with many schools so i could learn that is so awesome and by the way i've already shared that with so many people uh not just my wife and kids but i even posted it on my linkedin profile thank you for that comment it totally made my week to read that last week awesome thank you thank you hi my name is darby fazio and my question is um what made you interested in computer science first sure what grade are you in are you are you're all in seventh grade aren't you i'm in eighth grade you're in eighth grade okay um so i had a really unusual introduction to coding and computer science i grew up in iran in the middle east during a war which is pretty much the worst kind of place you want to raise a child our neighborhood was literally getting bombed every other night so we spent most of our nights in the basement just holding our ears uh hoping our house wouldn't get uh destroyed by the bombings um so in that atmosphere my dad one day brought home a computer and he he said this has no apps and no games and no software on it but here's a book and if you teach yourself coding and he helped me get started as well he said you can write your own apps in your own games and basically i had nothing else good to do at the time so it was my escape from a really really tough uh childhood um but then when i came to the united states as an immigrant i was 12 years old and i was really good at coding because that's pretty much the only thing i'd spent a lot of my childhood doing so by the time i was even 14 or 15 years old i started getting summer jobs at tech companies it wasn't even legal to be working yet but that's how i had made my money to help pay for school in college thank you um hello i think what you're doing is noble and it's not every day that you see someone giving something fun and cool to do for free to students and encourage them nowhere um hi you're welcome hi my name is victoria rossi and my question is what were some reasons for creating code.org hi uh so the reason i started code.org is because you know like i mentioned i started learning to code because of my dad most kids are not going to learn to code from their mom or their dad and when i started which was like in the 1980s computers were sort of a new sort of thing and they were kind of a novelty to own your own computer these days computers and software everywhere they're in your phones in your pocket in your cars every phone call you make is going through a computer pretty much everything whether it's from entertainment from to commerce to communications transportation even agriculture is being changed because of software and yet most schools don't teach computer science and i just thought that computer science is in the 21st century as important as all the other math and science and history and literature and all the things we learn in school it's just as important to learn how the world of technology works so my vision was that every school should teach computer science so that every kid can have the basic exposure that i have the good luck of having okay thank you hi my name is tina lee i appreciate that code.org offers another subject that allows students to express their creativity and it's something students can do in their free time unlike math or history thank you you're welcome math and history are cool too but uh thank you i'm back okay emily hi i'm emily shot i'm in eighth grade um my question for you is what new things are you looking forward to adding to code um well there's so many things we're looking forward to but my personal passion is to teach more about artificial intelligence and machine learning which is one of the things that is completely going to change the world of software and technology in the next 10 years it's already changing it and you hear about artificial intelligence that's not going to be like you know at least not in the next 10 years we're not going to have robots that have their own brains and know how to just you know act like humans like you see in the movies but what we are going to have is computer systems that learn how to do things that you think only humans can do you know already computers can recognize your voice or recognize images or recognize handwriting soon computers are going to be driving cars there's so many things that basically are human tasks that are going to be done by software and understanding how that works learning how to harness that and also understanding the social implications of that are i think one of the most important things to put in code.org now that's for older kids i think for the younger kids that's another question hi my name is julia paquette i want to thank you i think it's very cool and smart to create a website to get people into coding and opening up many more opportunities for the future and what they want to do thank you very much hi my name is maria tassie and i was wondering if you expected that code.org would be so popular uh never in a million years would i've imagined that this would be so popular um just to give a sense of context it's just been less than five years since the idea came about for the hour of code and you know it's just an idea that i had standing in my kitchen at that time code.org was i think three or maybe five people uh and you know basically the idea was let's get every school in the world to try an hour of code which is a pretty big dream to envision uh we're now at the point where the hour of code has been done almost 600 million times almost two out of every 10 students in the entire planet have done it the majority of all students in the united states have tried the hour of code onefourth of all of america's students have an account on code.org so no there's no way i would have imagined that fast of growth um what we're doing is basically one of the fastest growing or maybe the fastest growing thing in the history of education so that wasn't my i mean that was obviously a hope but i didn't think it would actually be possible and actually it's a really good lesson which is that in today's world of technology dreaming big is a good idea the bigger you dream at the the more opportunity i think you have and technology is so amazing because it lets you create something that spreads not just across your neighborhood or community but but globally as well thank you hello and good afternoon my name is zhang hao lee and i'm in 7th grade i have a comment for you i like how you feel that coding and technology will be important in the near future i agree that having an education and technology is important thank you i agree as well hello my name is um eileen mcdonald i was wondering did anyone ever doubt you along the way uh hi eileen yes uh well first of all i doubted myself along the way which is probably the most common form of doubt uh it's nobody starts something and automatically knows it's going to be successful and the the person who most doubts an entrepreneur's success is the entrepreneur themself uh pretty much any successful person you look at they're also the number one person who doubted themselves um but the the type of doubt i heard the most is people saying that schools never change uh and they basically people said don't start this as an effort to do this in school try to do it after school or in summer camps like coding should go in these other places because regular school will never teach computer science and really the reason we've been successful has been because of hundreds of thousands of teachers like miss galarani who've decided that this is important enough to put in their classrooms so you should all give her thanks and a round of applause because she's one of almost a million teachers who've begun teaching coding in their classrooms and what we've done couldn't have been possible without teachers like her hi my name is mia santiago it's really amazing to me that you that you created courses in a simple way that teaches coding thank you very much that was basically our goal so we're happy that it worked hello my name is ananya ball super mania could you please tell me what your advice is to kids who wish to pursue a career in computer science um sure the first thing i'd say is the reason we teach computer science as part of school or the reason why code.org is that it isn't just so you pursue a career in it whether you want to become a lawyer or a doctor or a nurse or a scientist or a farmer it's helpful to learn computer science at no matter what you want to go into if you want to get a career in computer science i'd say a couple things it gets harder at you know in sixth and seventh and eighth grade it's much easier by the time you get to university it's not nearly as fun you know you aren't playing with minecraft or angry birds uh you're you're doing more serious stuff so sticking with it through the challenges as probably the top advice i'd give and then the other thing i'd say is that the world of technology is increasingly giving people unique levels of power that they haven't had before and it's really important to learn the other subjects as well you know the humanities and the things that basically help us understand society better because we shouldn't be building technology for technology's sake and learning things like history helps us understand how to use technology in ways that are good for the world not in ways that are bad thank you and you're welcome hi my name is maddie busalari i'm in 8th grade and i just wanted to thank you for creating code it really educated me on objectives within technology and coding thank you maddie hi my name is teddy haney could you please tell me why you find it important to teach students about computer science sure um i don't want to be too repetitive but actually the reason i already said is because i think computer science is changing everything around in the world around us and so it's just as relevant as learning biology or chemistry and learning about how atoms work or how you know your your body and living organisms work technologies is impacting our world just as much but there's actually two other reasons i think we should be teaching computer science in schools one reason is because a lot of the things that we're teaching are old and outdated and might not be useful anymore and meanwhile one of the most useful things happening in the world is technology and then the second is to make school more fun uh you know computer science and coding is creative and when i was learning computer science nobody thought this was the fun thing for students to do they thought it was like the super gigi thing for just the nerds to do um but these days we hear regularly from from students and from teachers that coding is among the most fun classes and something that kids want to do because of their creativity and so one of the reasons to teach computer science is to make school more engaging so students like it more thank you you all are so organized hi my name is tucker silva i'm interested to hear what you think the benefits are of coding um there's so many benefits but i think the creativity and the ability to make something out of nothing is the most important benefit you know there's very few other skills you can learn where you can start from almost nothing and then just go on the internet and then create something and whether you create it just for yourself or whether you created for your family or for your small business or you create something that you can sell or use to change the world the opportunities are limitless people are using coding for detecting diseases for sending emergency blood transfusion to to villages in africa to all the way to trading stocks on the stock market or first making snapchat filters there's such a wide range of things you could do with it whether for entertainment or for for helping change the world or for making money um so it's kind of a superpower thank you good afternoon my name is robbie rivosa and i was wondering when you learned code was it always your plan to teach code somehow or did an experience make you want to teach um it was definitely not my plan i started learning when i was about your age so i didn't really have any sort of plans i just was having fun and you know going about my life doing whatever felt right at the time so i'm sure most of you don't already plan what you're going to do when you're 40 years old and i'm 40 now so it took a long time to get here but as i was growing up i had such so much success in my career everything i ended up doing because of my technical background i felt i had a leg up on people and meanwhile all the companies i worked at or the companies that i helped along the way through my career everybody struggled to find great software engineers and coders there's just not that many of them in the world and i remember thinking like why is it this thing that i'm doing that pays so much money if you get do it as a job why is it so hard to find people who know these skills and then i realize it's because our schools aren't teaching and that's when i decided i wanted to help solve that problem and effectively become a teacher thank you hi my name is danny shay i was curious as to where you were a software engineer hi danny well i started my first job was actually at mit at the university in cambridge massachusetts it was one of my first coding summer jobs and i it wasn't actually legal for me to work then because i was i think either 14 or 15 so i was kind of getting paid under the table um my first fulltime job was at microsoft which is the company that i actually worked on the early versions of the windows operating system so it's in seattle which is where i live right now thank you hello my name is will cosgrove and uh the question i wanted to ask you was do you remember a specific moment when you just fell in love with coding i will um yeah for me the specific moment i fell in love with coding was learning how to make recursive fractals with computer graphics so um you know little images that if you look inside then there's the images inside the image and it's inside the images inside the image and it goes on forever which you know making something like that is almost impossible to do by hand to make it perfect but with a computer you can make it in fact if you look behind me there's a whole bunch of pictures that students make using the code.org artist these are pictures made by young kids um but this one was made by me um which is a recursive fractal if you can see it's a little tree that each branch of the tree is a little tree and each branch of the tree is a little tree and it takes only about 10 lines of code to make that but it's something that you couldn't do by hand and that's what made me fall in love with coding thank you very much hi my name is emerson bernardi could you please tell me what degree you got in college that helped you prepare for what you were doing now wait can you repeat it can i tell you what what what degree you got in college that helped you prepare for what you were doing now the degree i got was in computer science uh and it's funny because we're called code.org but we're really about helping schools teach computer science and computer science isn't just about coding it's about learning how computers work uh how their operating system works how the internet works uh it's about learning how to analyze data how machine learning impacts things cyber security and how to keep computer systems safe but coding and computer programming is a big big part of it it's right now one of the most sought after university degrees um and more students than ever before trying to learn computer science because uh it's such an important field thank you you're welcome hi and good afternoon my name is cecilia allen tuck do you think that code.org is making a difference in young kids um yes i definitely think code.org is making a difference in young kids uh you know it's just amazing to see so many of you here uh lined up to even talk about it but you know we're we're at the point where globally over one out of ten students on the planet have tried coding on code.org and that doesn't mean all 150 million of them are going to become coders one day but i know just from watching my own kids at trico.org for the first time even when we made the very very first drag and drop thing to make the first angry bird go to the pig i know the reaction that they have using it they're like oh my god this works now i can build on it i think it teaches not just coding but it teaches creativity and optimism and it helps students feel like they're in control of creating something rather than just answering multiple choice questions and for that i think more than anything else is is one of the greatest impacts we're going to have on the world i think it's nice that you started a website to teach kids how to code that is free to use and i'm really glad that i'm fortunate enough to use it because it makes you think of solutions to problems that you may never thought you could have solved so thank you thank you and this is our last one hi i'm alejandra figueroa mr partovi in 10 to 20 years do you believe that computer science will become as important as math and science that's a great question alejandro i think computer science is already as important as math or science uh it's just a question of how long does it take for the school system to to basically recognize that and the reason i think it's just as important is you know the reason we teach math isn't because everybody needs to become a mathematician it's because it helps you get a sense of you know first of all how numbers work and how they interrelate but it also teaches you critical thinking skills and it is foundational to so many other fields of study and computer science is just as foundational to so many fields of study you know whether you want to become you know math is important because you need it if you want to become a physicist if you want to become an engineer if you want to work on the stock market if you want to work in health insurance if you want to become a doctor there's so many fields that that rely on math and increasingly the same thing is true about computer science as well the latest innovations in almost every field of study are driven by computer science and in every single industry uh the the fastest moving things involve computer science you know that if in farming the most important changes that are happening or dr are tractors that are driving themselves or ai driven devices that monitor the crops using computer vision uh you know in in making cars every single car maker is trying to figure out how to make their cars selfdriving using systems that automatically drive the car there's almost no field you can think of where the latest greatest stuff isn't being done using computer science so i would say it's already as important as math and science thank you well that's all the questions we have for you today and we cannot thank you enough for giving us us this great opportunity to chat with you today i know we went over our allotted time and i appreciate that your time is really important so thank you thank you it was super fun please everybody give another round of applause to ms galirani and all of your teachers for being able to thank you thank you and have a great rest of your day
