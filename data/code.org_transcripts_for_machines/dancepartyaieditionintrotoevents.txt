hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software engineer at code.org choreographers give dancers directions on exactly when to do a dance move in dance party you'll use code to direct your dancers to move when you want them to so how do you do this think of a situation where you do something like press a doorbell and then something else happens the doorbell rings when coding your dance party you can use events to make your program respond to a key you press for example you can code an event in your dance so when the up key is pressed your dancer does a dab or maybe when the down key is pressed a different dancer does the star events are like many dance sequences that aren't connected to your main setup they stand on their own and the dancer only responds with the dance moves you coded when you press the right key on the keyboard be careful when choosing dance moves make sure the dancer you're cing is already on the stage if your dancer isn't there they won't get the command to dance so what kind of dance will you queue up press run hit those keys and watch your dancer Groove
