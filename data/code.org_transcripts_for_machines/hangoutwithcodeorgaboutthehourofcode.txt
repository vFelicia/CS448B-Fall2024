okay hello this is James guertin from co.org on the chief evangelist for code org and I am I just can't tell you how excited I am to be here today it is Friday we are on day 5 of the hour of code or the cs education week day 5 of doing the RF code and the response has been phenomenal uh we had a stretch goal when we started this week of maybe possibly trying to reach 10 million students by the time the week is over uh and frankly that was an aspirational goal if we'd gotten to 1 million we still would have taught more kids how to program then learns computer science and then tried computer science into the last for three or four years combined instead we not only hit our 10 million goal we actually blew past it we're already at was at 14.1 million students have now done our programming since we started and we're only on day five we're not even done with day five yet still have a weekend ago it's unbelievable we thought maybe who is it 15 million now it looks like we're going to go and beyond that so thank you to everyone's been part of it you haven't yet done your RF coat it's not too late you can still do the RF code you can talk to schools talk to teachers talk to colleagues talk to friends talk to parents talk to your own kids we've got them and do the RF code because this has been such an amazing event we really are changing the future of computer science really because when you think about it every year in this country roughly 70,000 students study and graduate the computer science degree this year right there on this week we're reaching 14 million students to try programming if even just well if ten percent of those students decide they want to study computer science that's 1.4 million students if you know it's an amazing set of numbers was thrilled to see the participation we've had obviously code.org does this because we believe computer science is a basic literacy the feature we believe everyone should learn how to program a computer even if you don't want to do and go into it as a fulltime career it's still a valuable background ahead because frankly every career out there these days needs computer programming some degree or another they look at the data from the Department of Labor Statistics every single career every single industry now has space for computer scientists and computer programmers and so it's a great deal the theme of our code one the whole reason we're doing this is to send a message that anyone can learn that you do not have to be a math genius you don't have to be a bill gates in order to learn how to program and so by giving this one hour long taste of computer science the hope is it a significant percentage of people who try will decide they want to go on and go further and actually I do this as a career and take a programming professionally so the today's the focus of this chat was going to be an interview with Leo decoder he's gotten a lot of press recently he was formula he's still as homeless but he he reached an unusual agreement with a gentleman New York who got to know him and stop the one day and said look I could give you money i'm willing to give you a hundred bucks cash or i want each other program which would you like and you said I won't limit a program and so he did he went off he learned got a program and he wrote his first application which to publish this week it's a very inspiring story so this is going to be a chat with Leo as a chance to talk about the tools he used uh fitting of a theme of anyone can code unfortunately something come to us minute Lou had to step out and we're not sure if we're going to get them back again in time for this chat so for those of you who are watching live uh my apologies right there that's the that's the office early literally just minutes ago was sitting along with Patrick the gentleman tato had a code and so what I want to do is while we're waiting for him I will let you take your questions about topics other than Leo himself if anyone has any questions about our of code or broad questions would have to take them while we wait and then and then we can go from there it really is i must say to anyone who's watching if you've done the hour of code thank you if you haven't done it yet you really should it's been fantastic and and so yeah so I see a comment here the RF code is awesome thank you very much I think so too I must say it's been the response has been phenomenal we haven't already go to Twitter and n search for the hashtag hour of code and you will see some really inspiring photographs and comments from people from living across the world there are my favorite photographs are these shots of like kindergarten classrooms with like 20 kids lying on their stomachs on the floor surrounding a set of iPads all learning how to code together it's just been great we're hearing reports and teachers who say our kids never collaborate together and now they're actually collaborating to program which has just been amazing so that's just been really fantastic Ike another question here how many total lines of code have been ridden in the hour of code so far yeah it's crazy we've actually had at the exact number now is 450 million lines of code of them written now here computer scientists you know that's kind of a funny statistic because you don't really measure productivity by the number of lines of code written but it is still a useful measurement of this how much activity's been going on and so together all of our students have written 450 million lines of code which is pretty remarkable so that's kind of fun ok so what are the questions we have here I learned how to program a time only nine congratulations that is awesome we have always believed that you do not have to be in high school or in college to learn how to program I learned how to program basic when I was in elementary school I think a lot of the programmers who do this professionally learn the code when they were kids and so that we even data and as you might be skeptical there's even data that shows that people can learn how to program before they can learn how to read presumably not by typing text but by using the visual programming language but the concepts are the same so we think this is a fundamental literacy that is a great skill for the future that's great another question what is next for code Oregon 2014 great question so this hour of code if it was just the hour it would be a marketing stunt it wouldn't really be fun but it wouldn't have a lasting impact the ultimate goal for code org is to get computer science into blew up our ultimate goal is to ensure that every student has the opportunity to learn computer science and so that means number one teaching you right now we need only ten percent of our schools teach computer science ninety percent of our schools don't teach computer science and so our first goal is getting computer science into 100 cyber schools then once we've gotten there the next step is to start working toward getting computer science is part of required to Torah curriculum we're ideally every student in America graduating high school should have at least a year computer science we believe that would be a great to get to they already have that requirement in many countries within the to be requirement here in America as well but that's a longer term goal for now let's just focus on getting computer science into the schools and so next fall we're doing our first pilot program we're working with 100 schools that don't turn the teach computer science to introduce computer science into their curriculum we're also working with school districts around the country to help them introduce computer science so for example Chicago we're partnering with Chicago they just announced on Monday that they're going to be offering computer science in every school in Chicago School District which means in the first school district in the country to make that a goal which is fantastic and we expect to see many more to follow okay next question is the number of cut lines of code written just from the code that our tutorial or from all the other tutorials an answer is just the lines just the code org tutorial we don't have a way of tracking lines of code written across all the tutorials so in fact if you were to add up all the code written across all of our tutorials the number would be a lot higher because we're seeing a lot of activity in code Academy Khan Academy app inventor tinker a lightbox gotten a lot of positive feedback I've heard a lot of great things from a lot of people on all the tutorials we've been offering so yeah that's just the beef or hundred fifty million lines of code is just the hour of code to 12 that we wrote here at code.org okay let's see what else are we planning on making stuff besides games let's right answer that the tutorial that we built ourselves here is it's a it's like a game but really it's teaching computer science and if you go all the way through it it really is a pretty good introduction of computer science but not all the tutorials are like that some of the tutorials for example from the team of processing is actually focusing on using a computer language to create art which is a great activity and there are others so so I encourage you to check out other tutorials they're very different and not all about games in fact only few don't actually our focus on games or game like okay that's it for the questions I've got so far um let's see one thing I would also like to share some interesting statistics from our department of code or statistics not only have we reached now over a 14 million students but that is more students uh and have studied programming in the entire history of computer science is that right yes so we've had more students study computer science in past week or so that more students try programming in the past week as far as we can tell have tried programming an entire history of computer science in the US schools which is a superset and if you start looking at example women or minorities like African Americans or Hispanics the numbers even crazier something like more girls and try computer science in the last week then it's like five times more girls of prior to the last week than an entire history of computer programming English schools and and even crazier like 20 X when you should talk about minorities like students of color so that's that's just awesome so that's it that's the update from co.org headquarters here in beautiful Seattle I wish we had a Leo here to join us unfortunately he had to step away and we had some technical snafus that prevented us from starting on time and so my apologies to everyone so if you were here early you're here on time thank you if you missed it uh well and will stream this and hopefully we'll be able to reschedule this chat for later once when so we get them back okay thank you very much thanks for joining in and please again go do hour of code code org you haven't had a chance yet watch the video to really fun video two minutes long you can see that on co.org as well alright thank you and signing off
