what computer science is is that it's a way to impact the world it's foundational for any type of work programming is fun and easy you can do anything your mind wants to do programming isn't as hard as it seems it's actually really easy when you follow this learning these skills isn't just important for your future it's important for our country's future I feel pretty passionate about making sure that we're equipping our kids with a real tool set when they leave K through2 education we designed the code.org courses to feel like a game you're writing simple code to solve puzzles to get to the next level and the programming uses visual blocks instead of typing which is how introductory programming is taught at leading universities these days because it's easier for the kids to get started and as a teacher you get a dashboard showing your students progress throughout the course code.org has three courses that we recommend for grades K through 5 each course is a mix of lessons where students write programs on the computer and lessons where teachers lead activities so students learn computer science Concepts without the use of a computer in course one which is meant for early readers grades K through 1 our online lessons start off with learning how to use the mouse to drag and drop puzzle pieces students then go on to write programs that draw different patterns get the Angry Bird to move to the pig move a be around to collect nectar and make honey and in the spelling B students write programs to move the be around and spell different words if your Elementary School students can read and are new to computer science we suggest starting with course two which is recommended for grades 2 through five some of the same characters from course one show up in course two and there are also some new characters like writing your very own Flappy Bird game once students have finished course 2 they can move on to to course three which we recommend for grades 4 through 5 familiar characters like the artist and Angry Birds show up along with new puzzles like the farmer and creating a bounce game in all three of these courses students also work on openended sections where they can create art of their own or a custom story or game this is a great way for students to use computer science Concepts that they learned in the puzzles to express their creativity and create something that is completely their own yes oh my go oh wa if it's something engaging and it's something fun for them and it builds these critical thinking and problem solving skills then we're only setting them up for success and it we should be using it and that's part of our task is to educate students that you know what computer science is not for them over there or somewhere else it's for you here now
