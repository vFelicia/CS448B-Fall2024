software and computers um it used to be that that was just kind of a separate area of the world but now software touches all these different things that you use um i think if you look in everything i mean there's more phones and tablets and laptops and websites and everybody's on social media and i mean it's just all these different things and everything's just moving faster so um just being in a position to kind of understand that language that's going to be the future i mean um i think it's uh i think it's a good thing to do it's absolutely crucial to know how to code and to understand how technology is built even if you don't choose to you know make a living or be a fulltime software developer understanding how software works which is something that affects everything around you from your purchases to you know how you eat and just how everything works nowadays it's really important to be able to know how it works so that you are not sort of a victim of other people's choices it's important for these kids right now starting at eight years old to be a citizen on this planet hey whatever country you're from to read and write code you know if you wait until you're an adult you probably will never do it i just felt like if i didn't learn how to program it it would be like not learning how to read you know the the future would just be closed to me when i think about what we're going to be teaching in schools 5 10 15 years from now i definitely think that computer science or at least basic programming is going to be as important of a skill as being able to do basic reading and writing and i think we're going to look back and wonder why it took us so long to get to that point you
