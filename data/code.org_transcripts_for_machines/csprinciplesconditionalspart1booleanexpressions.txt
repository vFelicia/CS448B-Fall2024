When programming, it is often necessary to establish whether something is true or false. so that a computer can make decisions about what actions are appropriate to take next. For example when deciding whether or not to provide voter registration information the computer must first determine if it is true that the person is old enough to vote this is something that is done using what programmers call a boolean expression you can think of it like a yes or no question that the computer can evaluate it's called a boolean because it's named after the mathematician named George Boole who made many discoveries related to working with binary true or false values in the voter registration example your boolean expression might look like this this asks is the value stored in the variable age equal to 18 if it is then the statement is true otherwise the statement is false remember the double equals is the Equality operator it asks if two things are equal or not if you are using the single equal sign you are using the assignment operator to set the value of variable which is something else entirely in addition to the Equality operator we can ask questions about if one value is greater than or less than another value and these are called comparison operators if you saw the statement 3 less than 2 in math class you think something was terribly wrong but this is still not math class in programming you use the comparison operators to ask the computer question which it can answer true or false so with this line the computer sees you asking is 3 less than 2 the answer in this case is no or false we can use a comparison operator in our voterregistration example to make the program even more accurate because it's not just 18 yearolds who can vote it's anyone whose age is 18 or older so the questions you'd want the computer to evaluate should be is the users age greater than or equal 18 like this now that we can express the question we can have the computer actually do something depending on whether the answer is true or false such as displaying the registration info if true we'll learn more about how to do that next
