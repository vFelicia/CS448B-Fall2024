hi my name is menika i work at aws internet of things and i'm a software development engineer there coding in general and software engineering is just thinking about what is the simplest and most efficient way of doing things this doesn't have to be a male dominated field at all like women can easily do what the men can do here when we use our phones or computers we are constantly interacting with technology these interactions are important because through them we can control our devices say as software engineers we were asked to develop some code for a phone we might want to ask what a user's favorite color is and update the background to that color let's see how we can get and use user input to get user input we use a class called scanner scanner is a builtin class in java which includes methods we use to get information from the user it can read user inputs of all different types at the top of our code we want to have an import statement this is what allows us to use the scanner class in our code we create objects using the scanner class the same way we create any object in java here we have a variable named input which is one of the type scanner just like other variables you can name this variable anything you want just make it descriptive when we initialize the scanner object we call a constructor from the scanner class we use a constructor that has an argument of system dot in this tells the computer that our scanner object will look for input from the keyboard
