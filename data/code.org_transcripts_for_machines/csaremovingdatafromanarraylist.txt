foreign and I'm a senior director of engineering in the Xbox team at Microsoft success is at the other side of failure where on this you try you will never you know continue to grow us just as a human being all up and so we definitely Embrace that now in fact you know the people in my team which are amazing engineers and leaders like I actually encourage them to go try new things and let's go fail fast instead of being adverse to it their release class has a remove method that we can use to remove elements from the list these moves all the other elements over to the left and decreases the size of the arraylist by one let's say we have a grocery list that has five items milk bread apples soda and pizza let's remove apples from the list we can call the remove method with the index of the apples we want to remove the apples are removed and the rest of the elements in the list move over now the list has four elements be careful when you remove elements from an arraylist while traversing it let's say we want to remove items from the list that cost over three dollars in our for Loop we'll check if the item is greater than three if the item is less than 3 then we will just check the next index if the item is more than 3 we will remove the item from the list this will actually skip some of the elements with each iteration the index increases by 1. however the rest of the island shift to the left when one is removed since the elements are shifted to the left by one we need to shift the index back by one so nothing gets skipped we do this by decreasing the index by one when we remove an element now when we remove elements while traversing the arraylist the index is shifted with the elements removing elements from an arraylist is easy with the remove method just be careful when removing elements while traversing an arraylist so you don't miss any elements that you're looking for foreign
