okay we're going hi everybody I'm Alice Stein glass I worked on the new tutorials for our code this year the Star Wars one and the Minecraft one hola we're getting here okay we're now off the air okay sorry about that we now got our technology working here so I run our product and engineering teams here and marketing and this is hadi he's our founder and started the hour of code and we're here to answer any of your questions about running the hour of code with your classroom but before we go into questions I should just say how exciting it is to be one week away from the third annual hour of code for computer science education week you know when we started at this thing it started out as just a simple idea what if we get teachers to do one hour computer science and at back in June of 2013's or two and a half years ago we said this ridiculous goal let's try to get 10 million kids to try to do this in one week and was figurative via chewed for 10 million maybe we'll reach 1 million and hopefully that'll be great in that first week we reached I think 15 million students in the very first week and then last year's our code was literally twice as large this year it looks like it's going to be three or four times as large just based on the number of people who signed up saying they want to do it and this has become such a worldwide affair you know we've heard that the country of malta has told us they want the entire country during the hour of code the island of cocos island in the in the Indian Ocean is going to have all of their 650 inhabitants to the hour of code the ministries of Education of Italy and Russia have said that they're going to ask every single school in the entire country to do the hour of code in Russia is particularly interesting because they refuse to do anything to do with co.org because we're a u.s. organization and the Russian us are kind of in a tough spot right now so they won't talk to us but they're going to do it for every single school in the country which will reach at least 10 million students um and then in places like Nigeria we hear about where the bombs violins have been doing an hour of code in Syria there's you know right around all the syrup issues in the civil war that's going on people are participating in one Middle Eastern country that refuses to us identify them there's a girl centric you know girls hour of code much like there are and you know Western countries but in this country we can't promote it because they're worried about a government sort of retribution to the girls that are coding which is just insane but that's still kind of awesome that that's happening and then of course in the United States if you look at the map with the schools participating I think we've kind of broken the map i think as more people register it can't even handle the number yeah one of our top support questions is people asking us why they added there they haven't you added your you sign up you add anything to the map we know you did and it's not showing up on the map uh because too many people thank you looks like I villar Baptist not handling it gallon code is not about how much you can learn in an hour it's about realizing after one hour this is an important feel that every kid kind of can try it can enjoy it and that every school every teacher going to post this in their classroom and that computer science really is a field for everybody not just for the special geniuses not just for the 18 year olds and the last two years we've seen 90 different school districts in all the largest cities in the united states adopt computer science for full on curriculum multiple states have done statewide things in multiple countries have done countrywide requirements of computer science being taught as a formal part of the curriculum you know our real goal with the hour of code is to get full computer science courses put into schools the hour of code is just the initial start Adam but anyway it's been an amazing thing we can't wait for next week so it's a great way to break stereotypes I you know I think they're plenty people out there who think that codeine is scary or it's something that happens on your computer you can't touch it and would never enroll in a computer science class so we've talked to a lot of students who do the hour of code and it just helps them realize that it is fun and it's something that they can do and then go on to I just spoke actually a fourteenyearold girl who is telling me she tried her hour of code you went a little early I'm started yet but she already the hour of code this year she did Star Wars one and she's signing up for her computer science class for school next year in high school and she's never taken in a computer sign that she wasn't going to but she thought it was kind of fun and now she's going to try it out and that's just a great opportunity so thank you everybody who's on the call because you're all I know organizing the hour of code that's why you're calling it and you're giving your kids and incredible opportunity so I want to help you out with that it looks like one of the questions that were being asked is a principal who wants the entire school to participate in the hour of code and and she's looking for some suggestions to organize an event for the whole school hobby do you have thoughts on good ways to get your holster doing it there's a couple things we would say one is that if you go to the hour of code website there's this sort of under the resources on the left hand side it shows her about how to sort of prevent guides and they're actually sort of guides for how to organize at least a school assembly for that kind of an event like the runup show for what the school assembly should be but then there's a separate question of how do you list achill get every child in a school to do one hour of code if you don't have enough computers and we actually the section you know we stop giving the sort of prizes for whole schools that do this but actually the the section that talks about that we've actually put draft plans for how a whole school could do an hour of code and I know if it's possible to does that you can chat window alright it's very sore point out for most schools you don't have computers for everybody do it all at once and that's totally fine it's awesome to bring the school and for an assembly around the concept of computer science or what computer science is we've got a bunch of inspirational videos on the website that are great way to kick that off and whether you do that in a big assembly or you do that in individual classes the videos I you know I played them with everything from second graders to first graders up through high school and they're really fun for all ages and there's some great videos on there and it just gets people excited and shows you know maybe you don't know what computer science is so it's hard for you to answer the question about what is computer science or what I do with computer science the video is a good way to show that and we've also got a really diverse set of role models in those videos so you know students can see themselves and say oh you know people who look like me or people who are doing fun things and doing exciting things with computer science that's a great way to start it out for the logistics of getting the whole school through it whether that means moving the laptop carts from classroom to classroom or whether that means having the kids going through the computer lab either those are the best ways to do it and for a school that doesn't have laptop carts and or doesn't have a computer lab there's a other strategies one is frankly to do the unplugged tutorials all I need is a bunch of paper cups and paper to do with the easiest unplug tutorials or if you have some devices you can have kids pinner programming side by side you can have a teacher working on a smart screen and just having the teacher themselves do the coding and asking kids to show of hands say what should I do next let the kids suggest and then also many of the tutorials that we highlight are designed for smartphones and tablets so you know older age kids in high schools you know that they have their own smartphones in it to eat they just download the apps their smartphones all these absolute we press the ones that we promote to be free apps the owning to pay phone so all of those are different ways for a school that doesn't have enough devices good um actually you said one thing there I just pair programming which is really cool and worth the worth taking a moment to talk about because it's not just a concept for classrooms people actually do it in computer science as well in the workforce that you know you'll have two people working on a computer together to program and in classrooms especially for an hour of code into our code it can be really fun to have 22 students working together because they can talk to each other they have somebody to support them it's a collaborative effort and can be a lot of fun too in your classroom whether or not you have enough computers for every student you should think about whether your class would have more fun if they had a couple people working together at each computer I see another question that follows on sort of similar to the whole school thing and there's something we hear a lot which is you have a bunch of different grade levels and how do you how do you register the different grade levels to get a variety of code experiences so what is how do you find the right the right tutorial the right level of coding for all the different grade levels at your school sure if this depends on what the kids experiences you know first of all beginners that coding it doesn't matter what age they are if you're doing it for the first time at whether you're 30 years old or four years old you kind of want to start with the basics so at and most of the tutorials of coded or provides are designed really to be for all ages and really at the beginner level the only sort of special ages pre readers you know kids that can actually read you want to have weren't using with the tutorials that's designed for that age group so for example light light bought or boxy Island or two iphone apps that are if it is great foods that are designed for yes and those are all labeled last time you maybe have tons of questions from people asking about kindergartners a pre reader so I know there's probably a bunch of you on there if you are looking for pre readers if you go to code.org / learn and you look down on the page there's a section therefore it's labeled for beginners for kindergarten through grade eight and if you go in there if you flip through them it'll be labeled some of them are labeled for pre readers those are great if you have kindergarten as you can't read yet or even Lake preschool but for the kids who can read any age can start with the minecraft tutorial it's a fantastic one and if they're already experienced its long about age it's about experience if they've already done enough drag and drop coating that they want to move to javascript in our own Star Wars tutorial lets you switch to JavaScript mode or the Khan Academy tutorial or any of their the ones that teach JavaScript are sort of the next thing to go through you know we've tried to categorize and present many of them on the code or website and there's actually many websites now if you just google hour of code tutorials there's actual web says that can help you find in search different and choose the best ones as a question do you know the people in scratch and yes we know that the people in scratch add we're not working together with them you know they scratches its own tool in co.org built its own programming platform and scratch has built a tablet version of scratch jr. which is designed for elementary schools but it only works on iPads not on Android tablets and it's only for scratch jr. so so it's not the full scratch there's a company called tinker that makes a product that's very much like scratch and it's a forprofit company not a nonprofit as so some of the versions of what they do you need to pay for what the basic entry level is free and they have kind of a mobile version of all the types of things you could do in scratch question them here about what happens if you come and her back from ala tyr yet oh you haven't heard back from a volunteer so we've also we this is the volunteer system is new this year and we heard for you guys for the last couple of years that people really wanted volunteers to come into the classroom um to just help you know again if you don't do computer science if you know if you're not closely connected to it it can be great to bring somebody from industry and um you know just to see what is what does it computer programmer do what are they doing they inspire the kids let them talk someone let them ask their questions and so this year we asked you guys if you wanted to volunteer and we saw that there were lots and lots of people saying yes about 20,000 teachers say that they wanted a volunteer so we went out to lots of industries and universities nasty people to volunteer we've got about 10,000 volunteers who are happy to come into one or more classrooms um but it's up to you to go reach out to them and we don't want to give them your email address we haven't given them any information about you or your school or any way to contact you so the only way they can contact you is if you go to the site and you find a volunteer near you you can find we recommend asking three of them um you know we have not done any vetting of them um you know I've talked to a bunch who are excited to come in and help and happy to volunteer in the classroom but we have not if not to embedding some of them may be irresponsible and not write back um you know they have not done any background checks on them so that's up to you to do whatever your school does for background checks and if it's easier you know with only a few days left for hours between now an hour of code to not go through that process and just have them skype into the classroom that's also possible if your contact a volunteer and they have not gotten back to you definitely owe contact another one or two or three um I'd recommend contacting three because that increases the chance to get back to you and general we've had 20,000 teachers tell us they want volunteers we have about eight eight or nine thousand volunteers signed up yeah but not even all eight thousand have you even been contacted to begin with which means that over half the teachers who want to volunteer in the classroom I haven't actually spent the time to try to reach out so if you're interested in having somebody come inspire kids are just help out please take advantage of tool to reach out to them yeah and definitely I mean I know that our volunteers are somewhat concentrated in sort of the tech areas so you know a lot of volunteers in San Francisco we have a lot of volunteers in Seattle of places where there are a lot of tech companies we might have fewer in other places but definitely a lot of volunteers are excited about doing a skype or a remote called google hangout into your classroom so if there's a if you're interested in that you should just reach out to them anywhere and anywhere in the world and see if you can find somebody who would want to do that with you there's a question about should I assign a particular program for my students to work on in order to monitor their progress that's first of all up to you although we've tried to make sure that none of the tutorials for an hour code requires students sign up so our own tutorials you can go through a student signup process and a teacher signup process and then assign the tutorial to the students then you get a dashboard to see their progress but that's a lot of effort for just one class that's the type of effort you want to do if you're going to to teach us for 10 or 215 hours worth of multiple classes for just the first hour it's a little bit easier to just say hey everybody go to this link and give it a shot and monitor their progress by walking around the classroom that also has the benefit of letting some kids if they do it faster jump and try something else at and that generally works a little bit better for the single our kind of activity we also on all of our tutorials we wanted to make easy for you to see what's going on if you walk around the classroom so right at the top of the screen there's a little bar that shows you their progress and how far along they are so you can see just sort of glancing over their shoulders you know who might be getting stuff or who's behind or where they are so that's you know definitely I just recommend just letting them go for it and you can see it you can look around the classroom the goal is really just to have fun they're not designed that they have to finish it in an hour um and it's great if a student does you know if there's a 20 hour 20 puzzle progression and they do seven of those puzzles that's fantastic it's not it's not there's no you know you need to finish it in order to do your hour of code some of them are designed so that you know if you're a high school student might take the whole time and a you know a younger student might have more time to get through it if somebody's had experienced coding they might get through faster and then we have sort of players at the end where they can keep playing and doing more if they get through it well you were your website showcase any schools or classrooms that participate yes we always you know we tweet we we're trying to put together a page and this year just a bunch of showcases so if you are doing the hour of code if you can share pictures share tweet share anything you want on social media and tagged hour of code we would love to see it and we would love to share those more broadly with other people who are who are doing it so yeah tag hour of code that would be great and see and what I would def depressing answer the to Marin Kelly Tauruses question which is wonder will receive the posters which is we underbudgeted or actually under expected how many teachers would sign up and ask for posters so we've actually ran out of them in calf length of time so unfortunately the first I think 20 or something thousand people who ask for posters will get them there's at least 10,000 people who've asked for posters who won't and this partly because from a budgeting sampling boats literally we needed to print them in advance and guess how many we need and we tried to guess more than we need and we fell short so if you haven't received posters yet they're not coming unfortunately there's enough demand that we're going to come up with a way to basically make them available afterwards but at have to apologize that they're not available yeah we've had three times as many people sign up to organize the hour of code is we had last year are close to three times as many and that's that we did percent growth yeah and we are having tripling of everything which is a little bit hard to deal with so thank you for doing it and we'll try to keep up so do it other whether it's a good question about community events I was it get be oh just sorry as people are entering I'm they're moving so I mean it had to get participants to promote the event if it is going to be a community event how do you Anna sure um so the if something is going to be a community event first of all we recommend using your own local sort of avenues for doing that kind of stuff if you look at the hour of code websites there's actually a number of resources specifically for promoting whether it's the logo banners or things to put on webpages suggested tweets suggested social media you know arm the map we have on our website both the CSI week website and the hour of toilet website gets a lot of visitors but it doesn't get a lot of visitors among parents it gets visitors among teachers at and most parents I don't think are actually proactively going somewhere to figure out where their kids can do an hour of code so local PTA type things or places where parents would actually find here use however get spreading the word so an easy question here from a IT administrator they're asking how they can make sure that the tutorials work and that's what I recommend everybody just try before they start their hour of code from your school just because the school might have certain websites that are white listed or not whitelisted try from the device that you're going to be using going to the tutorial and playing through it just double check to make sure it works if you're using one of the code or tutorials we have AIT requirements site which tells you what to whitelist basically it's a you know code Oregon studio gorg and start our code I mean I'm co.org and yeah makes it easy but if you're um and then you know optionally can also do YouTube but even just code.org will work we're gonna need you to you don't need youtube so good don't work if using one of the other tutorials I don't know what your site has white listed or what you need to whitelist to do that tutorial probably depends on the tutorial so just try it in your try it out before you get started that's a great thing to do just check out make sure the tutorial works that's also a good way to check to make sure the device you're going to be using so be using iPads or tablets or computers you just want to try the tutorial on the device you're using to make sure it's going to work well for that device um there's a question from Luann's saying or looking as saying since my class already spent time last week does it count they'll of course it counts you know the point for the hour of code isn't that everybody has to do it during the same week in fact there's millions of people that are already starting right now and there will be millions of people will go one week late because of final exams or like that at you know we can't participation this literally year round but next week is basically the big leap when tens of millions of students worldwide at every participating which is what makes it exciting I think there's actually a pretty good chance we reach 100 million students in one week we'll see it's a day so this will be our third hour of code event we are trying to turn it into a yearlong activity with competition as the motivation how can I carry this over calculate carry this over year to year and allow the students to keep their progress of our school site admin for monitoring progress teacher dashboard yeah well I mean I think if you're doing that depends on whether you're using the code or tutorials or yeah picking your own if you use the code or tutorials that the three tutorial platforms and that we recommend that i know that do monitor student progress are the codes tinkers and Khan Academy's I believe also code HS and code Academy at the high school level do as well so if you use any of those five tutorial providers you can actually set up teacher account student accounts and even if you use them for one hour a year you can get that progress year and the student accounts stay the same but if you're doing it as a yearlong thing i would highly recommend getting student logins and the teacher logins for any of those systems so the ones that i mentioned were coded org tinker khan academy code Academy and code HS all have student progress bachelor's and I think another another piece to that is if you're going to be there sort of I couldn't really tell her two different questions they want us to do you know hour of code this year at our if code next year and continue to make it a thing to build the other is you know beyond the hour of code the kids have fun I want to keep going I want to you know do more computer science I want to bring this out into the school year and if you go to us code.org / well / learn is where all the tutorials are / learned beyond we have a list of all sorts of things you can do that go beyond the hour of code so we have tutorials at code.org 20 our courses that you can work in any through grades K through 8 and there are lots of other great options out there like Khan Academy code HS tinker of code Academy that will let your kids keep going throughout the year alright um there's a question about the code.org website crashing next week due to so much activity we had hiccups on the site last year first I'll be first to apologize for last year we had one and a half days of extremely foresight downtime during the our code and i'll take the personal going for that this year I'm quite sure it won't happen for multiple reasons basically because of last year's experience as the issue of last year was basically if one part of our side couldn't hold up or take the whole site down and the parts of our site that end up taking the most effort to run from a database template are things about involve things like student logins and what we're doing this year is making it too we can shut off individual subparts to co.org site while the actual core hour of code one hour sequence literally barely needs to hit our computers so if things go our I because we really can't predict how much the traffic will be we can gradually shut off all the rest of our site except the part that everybody wants to stay up just to make sure that that part stays up I would not worry about it new a question you're about oh my gosh a question here about swag which I just put in our showcase links so we have a blog post on the code or blog that will step you through ordering customized hour of code tshirts is it a blog code it's on blog code org and I link to it directly in the links for this yeah so Nadia if you want to order customized tshirts or for anybody else who's not familiar with that at we have a tee shirt template that basically has an hour of code logo and those are I think two different templates where you can enter your school name and order a teacher it's an order from custom inc com so we're not the ones creating the tshirts we've made the template available on crafts custom ink and anybody can change the time to make your own tshirts and order them from customer think i'm at blog co.org is the place to find a link for that um so this one is my students have created their accounts and have been doing the tutorials and they are cooked what will they do on the day we do hour of code in class um well if you've got there's no way to get all the tutorials there are over 20 tutorials we'll just different brands and then there's with each of them I me taker has five different tutorials you could do and um everybody's got lots of tutorials up there so there's no way you're going to run out of tutorials during um during an hour of code but if you're and you know another common question we get is my students did it last year and they're coming back and they we just want to know what I should do this year cuz i've got some students who are in my class or weren't in my class I don't know what they've done so to at the very top that we've got a brand new this year are the star wars and minecraft ones so if your students did do hour of code last year they have not done those unless you sign them up last week and they already have their accounts in which case they might have done those and then I would just let your kids I mean if your kids have had experience and they've done it before and you've got different kids have done different things what options just to let everybody do the real thing all of the tutorials are selfguided and you can let the students try different tutorials and let them sort of explore and have fun especially if their experience and they've tried this before they might have a lot of fun with that there's a question from Christie about do you think what will you be able to do code a tree this year and that was the last year a special promotion with the White House to actually write code to basically light up the White House Christmas lights and basically in connection with that you have they briefly did an actual event with the Christmas lights and then made a sort of coding project or on that but because the white house isn't parts fitting that particular thing this year I don't believe that's the middle one more have but the group that made that out of google called made with code is is coming out with a new tutorial this year that should be pretty fun um I don't see we're still can create an account okay so if you're looking for your students to get out again you don't need to create an app actually it would be better not to bother the job doesn't work for you let's work for you and you don't imagine up to deal with it the kids don't need to log in our recommendation is don't have the students create accounts if you do want to create an account the reason to do that would be because you're planning on teaching more than just the hour of code so if you want to do the hour of code and you want to keep going and you want to you know maybe do one of twenty our courses that's where it makes sense to create an account and with young kids I actually start not by having your students go create their own account but start by creating your account on the teacher dashboard and then the very first link there is to set up your classroom and you can set up a classroom for your students and give them all logins which are either picture passwords or words you just give them to write down that way if they forget it you can always give him a new word or new picture password and you're in charge of it and they're all part of your classroom and you can manage the whole thing but again just don't bother our code we'd actually pressed every tutorial provider to remove their sign up requirements that your kids can just click link and start coding do it for one class and be done and go home and not need to worry about that stuff for the ongoing courses you know on our site if you look at code studio in the URL estudio coorg there's a wealth of courses there's about eight or nine different one hour versus but about a hundred hours worth of ongoing curriculum which will take weeks and weeks to go through depending on what age range you're in and for those if you go to studio about co.org the teacher dashboard set up in a student accounts that are all the ways to do that i'm going to repeat for the posters because that's come up you half times i just want to apologize for the teachers who ordered posters and didn't receive them we ran out and we just basically didn't print enough we expect it to have almost double fifty fifty to sixty percent more participants than last year we've had three hundred percent more participants than last year so we grossly underestimated how many posters difference and I'm sorry you can by the way somebody had mentioned up here you can print your own posters if you have a printer all the PDF files for our for our posters are exactly available and we will soon make available a link to purchase posters we're not sure those will be deliverable in the time you get there for next week so Lee has a question oh please question yessuh lee lees had a question about whether or not his students need to create accounts if they were going to do the ongoing courses and you you can use the outgoing courses without accounts but you would want to create accounts if your students are going to be doing the ongoing courses because it would let you see what's going on in the classroom lets you manage the classroom it lets you see the progress of your students all the different courses so yes if you want to sign up to do longer the hundred hours he was talking about then yeah go ahead and do create apps for yourself and the for your students there's a question from LuAnn saying if students use my classroom and code studio and they have a personal account to the lines of code combined the answer is only if the students account actually is part of your classroom if their own personal account is separate for your classroom they don't combine but if a student has their own separate account they can add you as their teachers who don't need to have two separate accounts with the same key students and is actually user interface for students to effectively invite a teacher to to join that teacher's classroom that said I would kind of not worry about the total lines of code it's just kind of a fun counter but it's not the most important thing at all of the students who care about it I guess it must be important take that and the question is are there any learning tutorials for objectoriented programming programming like C++ or Java if you look at our other programming languages tutorials I believe there are a number of these the and I don't can't think of one directly off the top of my head but I would say that object oriented programming isn't necessarily the first way to start if you introduce somebody to just one hour of coding the if these are kids who already have done computer science and you know have done basic coding and want to learn objectoriented programming then I would look at the frankly regular curriculum for computer science for doing that not just one hour versus and and there's many options of that if you look at our learn beyond page to find options for that the question is can a student use basically Google signon on a Chromebook instead of code or to sign up at we first for the hour of code suggest not to even bother creating a sign up there really for one hour of activity is not essential that said co.org sign up does support google accounts at and i'm not sure if that automatically works with the single signon on Chromebooks but but if you log in with a google account works I believe that should just automatically let you log in if you say create an account using your google account so we have a question here about whether a student account can be attached to multiple teachers so give a special teacher and a homeland teacher and again don't bother for the hour of go to create accounts don't bother percentage of teachers but this is probably from somebody who's actually doing the longer courses and doing that a co studio you can't do it today because a figure list it's kind of complicated how you how you get them into um depending what you're trying to do the answer is yes but it's not super easy grazie the students need to individually at the teacher yes second teacher has a teacher on their account yeah we are trying to right now because we've gotten a bunch of requests for that were working on a feature to make that a little easier so you can put multiple teachers on there but if you have if the two teachers are in two different courses just have them put the course goes for both of the two different classes there in individually from the students account and then you'll be in both classes I have another course minecraft them to complete their them okay so here's somebody who did set up their class and built a class and put all the students in it and again you don't have to do that but if you do do it and she assigned a frozen so Christi decided frozen as the tutorial they're all going to do and that will work great if some of them finish and they're ready to go on they can go ahead and click on any of the other tutorials without you bothering to assign them to your class even if you haven't assigned minecraft to your class to do what i would do is just write on the board for everybody code.org / MC and tell the students when they're done they can just go to that URL and do it or if they go back to the homepage on code studio or when they're done it will like when they click when they get to the end there will be a certificate and it says more courses if they click there you'll see minecraft right there and you can just tell them to go ahead and do minecraft and there's no reason you should sign that to your class um the other recommendation that had whether it's for Christie or anybody else you'll always have kids who finish faster one option is to have them jump to another tutorial another option is to have them go around and help other kids that will make your own life as a teacher slightly easier there's inevitably one or two kids who've already done this stuff and they know it all and for them to help the other kids is actually a different form of learning for everybody and makes for a more sort of engaging how a classroom experience oh and we got an answer guess Chromebooks work with my google account my students try today so thank you glad to hear it worked out great for you so yes the answer is yes a question about Oh logs activities so it has 300 students and they do not have great internet so actually if you don't have great internet there are two options one is student unclogged activity the other if you have computers but no internet is to do one of the activities where you can download it in advance to the computers and they're in the unplugged section if you go through it you'll see some blockley tutorials and we're going to see us before the hour of code monday hopefully we get some more unplug tutorials working on it right now that you can download in advance but also the unplug eat orioles are great um they're especially great they're really great with all ages this is two types unplugged means without even a computer offline means with the computer but it's not connected to the Internet we actually called it both unplugged up a little bit they're both games is the same section for business unplugged and offline yeah was the unplugged tutorials alice is talking about feel like coding but they don't involve a computer it involve one student giving instructions and the other student acts like the computer to act out those instructions yeah and it gives you the same sort of experience of coding and problem solving without the excitement of the computer reacting and about the fun of Star Wars for minecrafter or angry birds you think it's out ugh it is actually quite fun in a classroom because the kids interacted they're building things you know they're stacking cups so you can totally do it if you have 300 students doing it um you know it's great if you could you know break them out into smaller groups and a lot of the activities they'll pick one that will work well for your students and their age range but a lot of the activities you do with partners with pairs or the small group and so you can break them out and have them do that activity together I've done it with classrooms and it's been a blast especially you know little kids love to run around so depending on how old they are it can be great yeah for the school that have asked with 300 students by the way if you have bad internet you don't necessarily need fast internet for 25 or 30 kids simultaneously to be doing Darryl code the only part that is on our tutorials that is sort of expensive on the internet is the videos and those can be played on a smart board have all the kids in the room see that once and then happen just do the coding without the videos and the actual individual levels for 25 kids at once won't be that difficult but you know hopefully we'll have offline versions of the tutorials available by Monday and if not as the unplug tutorials will work as well yeah so we have a request for google classroom integration in the future yeah google classroom was awesome we don't currently integrate with it we are looking at that so thank you for the request if you guys have any other requests there's a feedback link in our on the site and we'd love to hear the things that you guys are looking for for us to add to the site so thank you for the the feature request I don't understand your beliefs questions lately do you think the our pop more bang if we get a volunteer or do you have a cool video intro yeah um so I think you know I think you should definitely do the video intro whether or not you get a volunteer I think just a great way to start off with the classroom it's fun I you know and it's super short so it's not a long video of all the videos are designed to be somewhere between like our short ones about 90 seconds um shortest one is 60 60 seconds so 60 seconds we've got up to 10 minutes but you know somewhere in the 60 depending on how old the kids are 60 seconds two minutes three minutes is a good if you don't know where the amount an intro videos are if you try either the minecraft tutorial or the Star Wars tutorial they show a bunch of inspirational videos there's multiple links throughout our website for how to find them there's six of them any of them are fantastic and whether you have a volunteer or not I would definitely use that yeah the reason to get our volunteers if you want somebody else helping in the classroom first of all is another hand friendly and who has some tech familiarity and knows a little bit about the about coding and then if you have that person then they can also talk more about what they do at a personal level in their job and what you know nearby you know tech industry jobs or like and students may not be able to connect with what they're doing here for one hour connects to your career and that's not as easy that our volunteer o'clock and for the volunteer talking I think you know most of the fun four hour of code is actually doing the activities so you don't want your volunteer talking for 45 minutes at the front of the room so what I would do is kick it off play the video introduce the volunteer let the students do the activity save you know five to ten minutes at the end them to ask questions the volunteer not they've done a little coding about was to promote what it means to do coding in a real job yeah and if you have more time you could extend it with the volunteer but I recommended both pieces Khalifa girls on the whiteboard and you know Starbucks ok I can recommend area so this is Kate she's been hiding off camera and she's going to write some URLs for us do you think okay so I asked my students okay uh I'm in a onetoone computing and running our sites commutable right one lower they can't see that who's slightly lower um okay um Santino's asked a question about basically our district point person else as sheriff section codes for each tutorial and how I built the track how many of our students are logged in using it or will be the only one and Santino there's a hard way for you to all subtract it but it's not easy enough to bother I would say that the short answer is the district point person will be the only one but not to really bother with it you know the goal of the our code is as much celebratory you know we don't want this to feel like standardized test taking and those types of processes in school should be at ninety percent fun and ten percent you know the prep time and that kind of stuff um so I I see a question here saying or not only question a comment saying that somebody asks their students to create accounts so that they could students could keep working after school they give them extra credit and monitor their progress outside of the classroom if you do want to monitor your students progress beyond the classroom that is a good reason to have accounts and again if you're going to do that at start by creating a teacher account and they're putting the students in from there if you're just doing it during the hour of code in your classroom it's easier not to bother with accounts what if we don't have any okay um what do I don't know these schools that teaches um how to code I don't have that way okay so in your community somebody say they don't have any schools that teach people how to code um I don't know if you're asking that because you're asking about volunteers are you asking you're just looking for how to run not sure where this question is going is it about heaven um the course is worth schools near body don't have computer science in general that's the problem we're trying to solve yeah you know we believe the solution for this isn't to have you know special coating schools or camps but to have regular school teach computer science as part of regular school curriculum and the best way to get that started for the school to at least try doing it for one hour at fit but Ron what I would suggest if you go to code org at if you you're gonna cook at work / promote you can also is what I make a note all of these links are in our showcase sidebar so you should see in your Google Hangouts there's a Q&A and there's a showcase and showcases were also we've been looking to think so you can use that to hop on directly but I knew at code.org / promote or if you sign the petition at code.org it will take you that paid to that page there's a letter that we recommend sending to your local school to ask your school to support computer science so if you don't know of schools in your area that that teaches your code if you go to where the hour of code tutorials are there's a bunch of tabs and it's one of those tabs is basically fine to local school and it offers a search for all the schools nearby oftentimes there are schools that you don't actually know about to offer a computer science uh and there was one I just just scrolled off so I was asking if you students don't have accounts and you're doing it over two days will their work be saved until they come back to the next day and this depends on a general note because i don't have accounts um but it depends on what tutorial you're using or which you know which on which site whether or not they can come back and start where they left off even though their progress wasn't saved so on our tutorials if you get to say there was a twenty puzzle progression and your student got through puzzle eight on day one they can come back and start on puzzle nine even though it didn't save all of their progress from puzzle eight if they remember their own puzzle nine they can come right back in a jump in a puzzle nine so you still even if you're doing that you still don't need to create accounts if you do want to create accounts it will obviously save their progress and they'll be able to start on puzzle line and see all of their progress up to puzzle ate some of the other tutorials also let you jump in wherever you're going a lot of them are in sequence so if you get halfway through um then you can't come in the next day and continue um but you know another thing to think about is if you're doing this for two days you can also do two different tutorials like the students don't need to continue where they left off they can also start you know a different tutorial the next day and get a different experience if that's simpler for you ah there's a question from Kimberly's as I who I actually answer that generally said my students all receive their own laptops us here can they keep going with these tutorials Thank You Kimberly first of all but of course they can you know the first year when we launched the hour of code the number one support question we got during the week was we'll all of this stuff still live a lot for the weekends and yeah you know we keep our tutorials around yearround and you know co dot orgs one our tutorials are extremely popular if you you know click a few links deeper into our side to go to code studio which is up there at Studio G org at there's hundred hours worth of tutorials and curriculum that you can use so we'd love for your students to go beyond just the first hour had whether they finish their math math lessons early or or what about so don't limit yourself just 21 our tutorials the tutorials at studio crows are earth are full on the horses for ten weeks or longer scroll down let's say some of the more questions fist um okay okay somebody there said my school district insists on tracking progress that's why we're selling it accounts I actually want to mention a point in this which is that we're not against you setting up student accounts or tracking progress we just want to make sure you don't feel like we're requiring it we allow the hour of code to happen without sign up to make it as easy as possible and we also support sign up to let you track progress but don't feel that code that org is insisting that you sign up okay so oh there's another question about signing up event somebody said they signed up their event as a special event but it doesn't show up on the map even though I received a confirmation letter is my event still registered so there's two to two questions we get a lot on that one of them I was talking about earlier which is people signed up their event but it's not showing up on the map that's because we have way more events this year that we were expecting and they can't I'll show up on the map so yes the bat broke the map rogue um but if you signed up and you got a confirmation letter yes we absolutely are doing your event or excited about it and it's counted in the total number of events which is close to 170,000 when i looked earlier today no what Oh broken droids okay we're both so 170,000 now crazy then a second questions about a special event so for the special events we wanted to highlight some exciting events around the world that are going on um we've had thousands and thousands of those as well we can't put them all on the map and still read the map so we we've got it we've registered it um we the ones that are showing up in orange we just look through them and picked some that we thought were exciting to highlight and we when I was not highlighting all of them but if you did submit and you're doing a special event we're excited about that we've got that registered so thank you for doing that um this is a great question wrong I'm between a teen it would really like to start a community of coding where teens can come and learn how to code any suggestions on how to start this kind of community I have two ideas of websites you can go to the basically give you ideas on this kind of thing one is coder dojo and the other is code club now neither those are designed for teens starting a community those are really designed for an adult who wants to start recoding community or a coding club when all the resources they talk about you know are relevant you know even if you're not an adult but the other thing I would say no matter what age you are is just get creative you know starting an immunity it's not like there's a rule book from how to start a community at and the best things just start with people coming up with our ideas and trying one thing and seeing what works you know everything we're doing at code.org we're not following a playbook that was given to us you know this whole thing started by just thinking that it would be great to do this at so get creative and come up with your own ideas Santino who's asking our website showcase any classrooms or schools that participate um the way we're going to be doing that is more on our social media rather than on our website at simply because we want to be able to highlight lots and lots of things and the time it takes to update the website at it will get in the way of the problem that somebody else asks about making sure the website is up throughout the leaf we don't want to mess with the website at all by the way if that's a the thing we took place it will update it will be on Twitter and on Facebook but yet I'm bej this before but the way to share that is to share if you could share about social media and hashtag hour of code then we will see it and we can we can share and be share and that's a great way for you also to share with all the other teachers out there so between a hashtag hour of code and then at mentioning code org those two things are the way that will see that it will be retweeting all the best things we see there's a question about planning an event in a library setting and how to promote it within your area and you want the this is Alan of its question mm and how do I get the maximum number of kids to show up at the thing I'd say mainly is get created in terms of the different avenues that are specific to where you live for sure you should use social media and then the next thing I would think about is how do you reach parents within your community whether that's at a grocery store or at a PTA at the local school or things like that at any of those are great options a great question about how to find more volunteers it looks like she's already committed to another school anyway to expand search volunteers outside the Decatur Georgia area yeah so again we have we have a lot of volunteers with thousands of allah tears right now still have not been contacted unfortunately they're not spread out geographically um they tend to be clustered so there are two things to do one is on the website you can increase the radius that you're looking for so on that website where we've got volunteers it defaults to I think ones with you know the five they're sort of closest to you but if you're not finding if they're not writing back or they're already busy just go ahead and expand it out look for 10 miles out 15 miles out and if there aren't any in your area there are a lot of volunteers who check the box saying the days yeah that they want to skype into a classroom or connect remotely they also might want it you know if you just need some help talking to somebody before the our code about anything technical that you're having questions about they might be able to help you with that too so I'd encourage you just to do a search in a different area you know do a search in um you know San Francisco for somebody Hill remote in to Georgia because there's a lot of people in San Francisco in the database right now so easy to answer looking for a system administration for moving kids from class to class that's another thing we're working on right now you can select it oh ok so another question we're getting is about moving kids from one class to another this is also something that you don't need to do for the hour of code but if you want to do it for you know because you're doing larger classes or because you're trying to like any of the reasons and bunch of reasons people were tracking data outside of class you have kids are in the class they're a couple different ways to do this one is uh you know if you're just if you don't need the data from the students from last year and we don't we don't keep a lot of data on the students it's just their progress on code studio so if you just want you know to enter them in a new class but you're doing a new class it's fine to let that data go and just enter copy and pasted a new set of names into the teacher set up for classroom and reset up your classroom for the next year if you do want to move the kids from one class to another um that is something we're working on making easier right now but right now you can do it by having the students enter the the course code for the new course at their entering and that will move them into that class um this is kind of a scary question me is saying my team team and I were all high school students will be hosting the event together in our community do we all get to thank you get sores or 14 event and the unfortunate answer it is only one prevent and i also would say that's similar to the posters I'm a little bit worried about running out of the thank you gifts so you know whether it's microsoft for the windows codes apple with the itunes codes or amazon with their gift codes have all been very generous to give us a limited number of these to get out at and i think we already have more people signed up for events that we have gift codes to give out although not everybody actually expects to redeem them or get them at but they end up being one per classroom only and we are going to run out unfortunately yeah and in terms of I think your question was how does she redeem it after the hour of code will send out a survey that you can tell us about the hour of code and then after that we'll give you the information on how to redeem the gift code nadi asks is there something that's streaming online or via social media that people can see everybody across the full who's enjoying coding during the same hour and we're looking to see if we can set up something like that at not on our own websites just because we don't want with our own websites at and I'm not sure we'll have something if we do we'll send email about it literally Monday morning Toki protect chance yes there's two other things I would say just looking at the map on our code calm is pretty fun if you visit that map and then zoom in and then look around the entire country and then into the entire world the number of places are going to really weird places that are doing the hour of code is just a really fun thing to do and it's fun to do with students and that's how they'll see people that are doing this throughout the week rather than during the hour the second is we'll have a number of these celebrity tech chats you know people who are not necessarily celebrities but influentials like you know if you have teenagers that are into buzzfeed the head of data science for BuzzFeed who basically she actually went to college with me but she's a computer scientist and uses data analysis to decide what what headline story mode on BuzzFeed she's one person or the founder of Instagram Kevin Systrom if you know again kids love and ceramic they're going to be posting these tech chats with a handful of lucky classrooms would like this google hangout anybody who wants to can tune into those and that's another fun way to the classroom to feel like they're part of something overall there's also in that inspirational video list which I one of those behind me at the difference well add it to the list of homes yeah it's on you'll see the inspirational videos so one of those inspirational videos is sort of about the momentum of hour of code and shows people all over the world doing the hour of code and plain that as part of you know either the beginning or end our code is a great way to give your kids the sense that your students a sense that they're part of something broader and that it's all around the world all right Kate this question has been plus 13 times the Maoris in Norfolk recently yes we had a question can you do the hour of code before after computer science education week if you have exams that week um I know where the pressure is but absolutely at you know we we make it a you know we try to get people to choose computer science education week as the time to the hour of code just to get the sense of international participation in a huge movement but you know you can do the our code anytime you want in fact you know in the last year the last 12 months there was roughly 40 million people who did the hour of code just during computer science education week and roughly another 40 million who did it throughout the entire school year since the end of December although until now so you know anytime is good to try computer science our real hope is after you try one hour of coding they go beyond that the goal of an hour of code isn't you know the kids are going to come computer scientists or software engineers in one hour you know it's not that they need to take a thousand hours or a whole you know lifetime of coding but you know a yearlong computer science course is something that every student should have at least the option to learn and those of you who are in elementary school teachers or middle school teachers you can integrate a short 20 our horses or module and we offer many great 20 our courses for different age ranges and we highly recommend looking into offering those throughout the school year can things sure I have heard about inviting local politicians etc what success have you had with schools doing this what about media outlets um yeah absolutely we've had governor's we've had senators we've had mayor's we've had of everything from you know the local guy just in your district to the governor of the whole state we've had multiple this year who are going to going two hours of code I think it's something that a lot of politicians really enjoy doing um it's a great opportunity for them to to to show that they are you know into technology to students into the future but it's also a good opportunity for you to get them to see what it means for this for your state to support computer science and you don't know unless you ask so nice lately strong in this particular thing is capable of ask how does coder or have so many celebrities involved in it or so many politicians or have to get the President to to write a lot of javascript etc there is no rule book for this and there's no like special magic to get people to say yes it just has to do with asking and asking the right way and trying to find a way to sort of plang people's individual heartstrings so you know if you're doing an hour of code with your school especially if the whole school is doing it at arrange a student assembly and then send a look a note whether it's to a politician or to the head of a local business or something it is not a hardass task or politician to come speak at a school for something like this especially if you send a photo of the president or governors who have done it you know last year the Prime Minister that UK did it there's also many people who participate in this I think in general the average politician would love to engage look like this it'd just be brave and if you get a no answer go to the next politician that's plenty of politicians in terms of media I mean they reinforce each other right so if you can ask the media if they come probably makes the politician more likely to show up but it's the politicians they're the video is more likely to show up so I would just say go ahead and ask it doesn't hurt to ask and it's a lot of fun for the students if they can get somebody to show up like that so you know one thing to do would be you organize your bed and by the local volunteer to come that we have somebody to speak are you know plan to play a video plan a little you know assembly and if you can get the politician there that's great it's extra fun and if they're not there you still have a great time and it'll be great for your students but go for it and the link we wrote below the hashtag hour of code calm / promote that teacher to our promote and our resources page where we have sample letters you can send to politicians or media if you're not quite sure what to write ok I think we're short on remaining questions this seamlessly kind of i'll just say also with three minutes so yeah go ahead yeah ETF closing as I system closing words just for people to miss the initial words we said hey first of all thank you everybody for joining in this is going to be an amazing week next next week you know whether you have a good time or a great time please share how it goes on social media or in your neighborhood or community you know the strength of the hour of code comes from teachers educators deciding as a community that we want computer science to be something our children that our students get to participate in and that community grows when you read the word about it whether it's on Twitter Facebook or just a word of mouth at printing the certificates for the kids to take home for their parents to see is another huge deal and that that if you're not sure how to do that the lesson plans on the website talk about that and that maybe a URL with running co.org / certificates is how you print the certificates for the students to get home and I think we're together somewhere between 50 million and a hundred million students to do the hour of code in one week this this year which is amazing the low end of that 50 million is the full student population of the United States at the high end of that is at the student population of the US and Europe combined somewhere between those two is the range of what we're going to hit which is just amazing and it's thanks to everybody in the educator community in the entire world that is participating this campaign and like if we've said before the goal of the hour of code is to have fun and for you yourself as educators and your students to gain the confidence that computer science as a field that any student can learn and to really go actually beyond the first hour to try ten hours or 20 hours or even a full for you dear long course whether it's for your students to try it or for your school to teach it I think that's about it so thank you so much thank you good luck we're excited you doing this
