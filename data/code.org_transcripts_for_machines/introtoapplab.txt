For our new high school course, which teaches Computer Science Principles, Code.org is about to release a new tool called App Lab. App Lab is a programming environment for students to make really simple apps. It has a design mode to let you design the look and feel of your app. You can then write the code either using blocks or using the JavaScript programming language. And then you can send your app to your phone in just a matter of seconds. Let's check it out! Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm the Product Manager on Code.org's Computer Science Principles project, and I'm going to show you design mode of App Lab which is where I can create the layout for my app without having to know HTML or CSS. The app I'm going to build iswe've been having a debate in the office on who is the most prolific pop star of our dayLady Gaga or Taylor Swift? So I'm going to make an app to let me pick which one you like best. Hi, I'm Anthony and I worked on a feature in our workspace where you can transition from blocks to text and back. I started working on App Lab more than half a year ago. You can build games, build lots of interactive graphics. So if you like to build animations, connect up an event for when that button is clicked, I'm going to use the Play Sound command. All the applications you build in App Lab you can share with friends. I'm going to share with my friend Alice, and I can just click the share button up here. So, Hi! I am Sarah's friend and she just sent me that app that she made, and I can play her app right here on my phone. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
