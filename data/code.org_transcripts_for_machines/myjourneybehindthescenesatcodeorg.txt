hello welcome to the second of our my journey class chats for this spring my name is darren webb i am a software engineer at code.org i'm joining you from my home in des moines iowa and i want to say thank you to all the classrooms joining us today uh teachers i'm happy to share that this session as well as all of our future sessions are going to be live closed captions so i want to give a huge shout out to patty who's providing our captions for today's chat i am excited to welcome one of my own colleagues uh here from code.org tess o'brien tess is a product manager and she helps to create some of the cool tools that many of you use on code.org we'll talk to her about how she creates those tools her journey to code.org and any advice that she might have for those of you out there who enjoy using code.org and are already starting to think about what you might want to do when you're older uh teachers please put any questions you've got in the chat uh and we will do our best to get to some of those by the end of the talk first question though i've got for tess uh tess if you could tell us just a quick little bit of intro about yourself and your position and then answer to this incredibly important question as i found out that today is national pizza day uh which is really exciting for me uh there are so many kinds of pizza out there you've got thin crust you've got new york style you've got deep dish chicago style you've got the school cafeteria sheet pan pizzas so uh my question for you uh is what is your favorite type of pizza okay one thank you for letting me know that it is national pizza day it has very much changed what i will be eating for dinner tonight uh i'm tess i'm a product manager working on teacher tools at code.org so the tools that help our teachers learn how to teach computer science and getting to the important stuff i spent a few years living in brooklyn so i think brooklyn style pizza is my absolute favorite i have traveled far and wide in seattle trying to find the best brooklyn style pizza it's like between thin and thick crust has some very salty cheeses on it it can stand up to like a sweeter topping controversial pineapple plug here um so big fan of the brooklyn style pizza what is yours oh i was just gonna say thank you for sharing that i'm worried that this is a very controversial topic and then you threw pineapple in there so i don't want to start any fights out there uh i love all pizzas all pizzas are delicious but there's something about uh a nice uh hand toss lots of cheese uh here in here in des moines the best pizza comes from a gas station that's a whole separate topic so we'll go into that later i want to talk about what uh what you do at code.org so what exactly is a product manager could you tell us a little bit about what that means yeah definitely i have some slides to share because it is a bit of a new field yes great uh so a product manager uh across the field can mean a whole lot of different things company to company person to person teamed a team but here at code.org a product manager's job is to understand our users so lots of folks in this room right now help decide what we should build help implement the build itself um so tracking and making sure things are on time making smart tradeoffs uh and then tracking the success whatever it is we build and figuring out how to refine it and make it a little bit better uh to dive in i feel like that just sounds like a lot of words to say what a product manager does so you're telling me that we just don't build whatever we think is like the coolest most fun thing sometimes we do but mostly um so i wanted to walk through an example of a problem that a product manager might face at code.org if that works for you yeah cool all right so say we at code.org are thinking about building dark mode uh dark mode is when the back of your computer screen has a dark color and then all of the things on top of it are brighter so as opposed to like writing in a word document where it's a white background traditionally and then black text over it you'd see a black background and more colorful text over it uh so say we have heard from teachers and students that they like dark mode they're interested in it a product manager would be tasked with figuring out is this something that really makes sense for code.org to build and the way they do that is through talking to users and talking and thinking about the market itself so firstly we go out and try to understand do our users want this do the students using our labs want dark mode that could look like coming into some of the classrooms that are here today and having a chat with students about do you use dark mode on other features or on other products that you use or it could look like things like questions along the lines of what time of day do you do your coding homework is it at nighttime when your eyes are tired uh or is it in the classroom um and so some uh when we've had these conversations before some of the things we hear are things like i work on my coding projects after i finish my other homework i like to be creative and keep working on it into the evening sometimes my eyes get tired before bed uh or something like when i use dark mode i feel like i'm really coding i feel like i'm a professional coder um it's like what it looks like on tv when someone's hacking something it's always this black background so we get a sense from our users it's something they're interested in it's something that sort of help would help them take a feeling away from using our product that is different than what they have right now um then we would dig in a little bit to market research and so that is looking around the industry looking around at how people use computers not necessarily not necessarily our product um but look around and see do other people use do people use dark mode elsewhere so just from a quick google search in this example i found that 91.8 of android users use dark mode at some point on their phone so that sounds like a pretty good piece of signal that people are interested in dark mode right now um another way of saying all of that that when i became a product manager really resonated with me is this graphic here so you have your customer you have our service which is the code.org labs and then you have what the customer can do with your service and so what would dark mode what superpower would dark mode unlock for our users and will dark mode really help them feel and be able to build things in a different way and so i think from talking to our users in this example we have learned that there is this deeper meaning to why someone might want dark mode so at this point if we have confirmed we do want to be building dark mode a product manager would go start working with the experts in the field so they would work with design to design exactly what our dark mode looks like for code.org and they go and work with their engineering team to learn about how long it's going to take what are some of the technical complications we expect and plan out the project itself they would sit with the team throughout the project and help make smart tradeoffs when things come in things come up or problems arise and then finally they would track the dark mode so they would be able to see how many folks are using it how they're using it and engage with how well this feature did once it's out there in the world awesome so you've had uh a long career in computer science i'm curious what what computer science skills or what what skills have you had uh that you've developed throughout your your career that got you to this place uh where you could be a successful product manager yeah definitely uh so i guess if i'm going to talk about how i got to computer science share my screen again for me that really starts uh with my grandmother maria barela in cuba she was she studied math and was an early mathematician she came over to the united states and was in one of the early women working for ibm uh so she herself worked in the computer science field for me that did not translate to enjoying computer science right off of that um when i was in the middle in high school math really intimidated me and i thought because i wasn't necessarily great at it from the jump uh that maybe it wasn't for me uh maybe i wasn't interested in it so i leaned on things i was interested in i studied i went to college studied political science came out of college and started working with nonprofits with that degree around that time in that industry there was a lot of unpaid internships a lot of parttime jobs uh so i worked parttime in nonprofits and parttime in the service industry i got to work on a grilled cheese food truck for many years which was a great gig um learned a lot during that time around communication uh being scrappy and savvy with what resources you have and how to make those work for you both professionally and personally um and then at some point while working with nonprofits i have the chance to help build an app for our users and i was so intimidated by that project i thought that i by not having done a lot of science or math when i was in school i had sort of avoided these types of projects but i was tasked with doing the project work to make sure that this was delivered on time and so i dove right in and something that i was so struck by was the amount of impact the engineers i was working with were able to make for the folks we were working with at this nonprofit and how the app was able to make tangible changes in folks lives and really amplify our mission uh during this time i also started giving some thought to why did i think i wasn't good at computer science um or why did i think computer science wasn't for me why did i frankly just leave math classes and computer classes as soon as i had the chance to uh and i learned about a program called general assembly which is essentially three months of 12 hours a day just coding and so i i didn't like that there was something i felt like i couldn't do and so i quit my job took out a loan i went to learn software engineering when i was about 24. i will say that it immediately came quickly to me by any means um but because i had taken a gamble on myself at that point i promised myself to be the most interested person in the class and to try everything i could ask every question i could and focus on having a growth mindset of believing that i could learn these new skills that at one point in my life i thought weren't for me um i left that program started work as an engineer and then learned about product management as a field which sort of combined some of these problemsolving communication skills that i in my early career i had done a lot of work with with this cool meaty software engineering and design work that i had gotten the chance to learn about in my early 20s i so i worked for a product manager for a few years with a bunch of nonprofits and then came in house to put that org and have been here for two years that's an awesome story the the the way that you kind of started you were exposed to some computer science you were exposed to that mathematics early on but it didn't really didn't really click and computer science is so big and there's so many things involved that sometimes coming at it from a different angle and and being willing to do those challenging things if we all just do what's easy we're never gonna get anything good done you gotta you gotta dive into those things that are definitely uh those challenges that you face and so that's an awesome story um if anybody out there has any any questions for your tests or about code.org or about her story uh feel free to throw those into chat uh i want to ask a little bit about what you do outside of work so when you're not working uh with code.org um what kind of stuff do you find yourself doing out there yeah so i live in the pacific northwest i grew up on the east coast and moved up here about seven years ago uh because i wanted to hike and get to explore the outdoors i i'm gonna use this as a moment to show y'all a picture of my dog please do think all right this is my dog love below she and i spend a lot of time exploring the pacific northwest uh so getting to hike adventure we work at coach.org right now pretty much fully remotely and so we've had a chance to get to see lots of beaches lots of mountains this year really good to explore it's always good to have a nice adventuring buddy do you have one i do we've got a border collie his name is zion and we're getting him we're working on him to carry his own little pack so he can carry his own like water and food and we can carry ours and he can carry his we bought low a pack but she isn't really big enough to convincingly carry much of her own stuff but i think she like likes the sassy walk of i have a backpack on they like having a job to do and a task to and then run it off into the water that's great um are there any uh you're talking about uh dark mode um are there any exciting projects at code.org that you've had a chance to work on as a product manager yes uh so my this this might be a horror story more than just a strictly exciting project um but i when i got started with code.org about a month and a half into working with the company i was asked to do the like project management part of our hour of code that year and we weren't releasing a new tutorial so there wasn't dance party coming out or poem block coming out that year so i was like i got this this this will be simple enough it was not is a really cool project where the whole organization works towards this one goal and we get a ton of traffic to the site a ton of kids using the product a bunch of teachers using it and especially during a pandemic there was just a huge amount of traffic to the site what i really learned in that time was to sometimes one of the best things you can do as a product manager is to remove obstacles to allow your coworkers who are experts in the field to really shine and do their thing so i got to work with marketing design engineering and video to make sure that everything on our site was up and running and was just sort of shoving things out of the way to help my colleagues be able to really shine that's something that i've enjoyed about um working with product managers um as an engineer is uh not everybody there's no one person who knows how everything works and sometimes you run into an issue where there's there's a problem in some area you might not have that expertise and it's usually a product manager who knows who has the answer to that how can i put all the right people in a room and then take a step back and and see that problem get solved yeah when things when there are problems and problems need to get solved sometimes it's just getting getting the right people in the right place and being able you being able to see that big picture uh really helps everybody else be productive so that's a an awesome position that you've got there if you were to go back in time to middle school tests or high school tests and give her a piece of advice uh knowing what you know now um what what advice would you give that's a great question um i think it comes down to believing that i could learn things and believing that it's worth learning things especially the harder things and so to approach in this example math but sort of everything as a chance to learn a chance to ask questions not necessarily feeling like i need to be the best in the room and if i'm not the best in a room find the room where i am the best but more so learn about a lot of learn a lot about learn a medium about about a lot of things um and take that approach of just being a learner being interested into every situation you're in so there's folks out there who are interested in maybe pursuing a career as a product manager uh or in computer science um how would they go about that will be some some good things to take a look at or the next steps yeah uh sort of in the same vein of learning learning a bit about a lot of things uh staying computer science classes i had to uh go back when i was 24 to start learning some of those foundational skills um but a really great way to get into this field is to understand the fundamentals of computer science if you have that you will be ahead of a lot of folks then also understand the fundamentals of a lot of other things so focus on clear communication uh general design principles and pay attention to the products that you're using i think that's something i love about being a product manager is interviewing for the work is fun uh you get to sort of think about things like dark mode and go into these deep examples sort of hypothetically and so when you are out like out there on your phone or out there on your device think about the products that you interact with day to day uh like think about a cool lamp you like and why you like it what it makes you like what about it makes you feel good what about it makes it fun and just sort of start to investigate why you love different products that you love that's very yeah i'm over on the more uh software engineering side but i think we both have kind of a web development background and that app development web development and i think the exploring a broad variety of topics uh focusing on building those computer science skills is valuable if somebody wants to be a software engineer uh but but always looking at the the big picture and the whole world because the code that we write it's it's for humans and it's for solving problems and so if you can really look out there at what what do you love about life what is frustrating about life uh and how can how can some technology help uh maybe solve that problem um what uh are there any um specific skills that you would recommend people try to look at as as developing a computer science career maybe from be broader than a product manager uh i feel like a great place to get started for someone like me uh who wasn't necessarily uh just interested in learning the languages to learn the languages um was the creativity aspect of it so as you were saying they're daring around like the idea that you can go from a blank page to having something on that blank page to making that thing move across the blank page um or to solve a problem or to create a quiz that helps your friend that you have fun with your friends with or your parents with uh really dive into the creative side of engineering um i found javascript to be really helpful for that and sort of all of the things that you can do with javascript uh beyond that i think the thing computer science taught me the most in my life is that every problem has a solution and i don't know why it may be that i was in my early 20s when i started coding that this really clicked for me maybe that's just something you learn at that age but for me the ability to have a problem on a sheet and to feel like it was unsolvable but know that there was a solution has really helped me in my life of approaching every situation as if there is a solution to it i just have to find it and rely on the folks around me to help me find it so i think that isn't a super technical answer that is maybe a product answer to a technical question but i think i think learning how to code learning how to code uh and realizing that yeah those problems have solutions and and you don't have to wait for those solutions you can go out and try to build those solutions yourself uh if there's a small tool that will help your club organize its event and you can write some code to make that happen then that's a you just created some value and and solved a problem out there early on in our conversation you mentioned that you uh had some mathematics and computer science folks in your family and had some encouragement from them that might not have stuck at the time but i'm curious are there any is there anyone else who helped you along the way um and guided you into your career definitely uh teachers were a huge help uh i feel like teachers helped me learn to ask the right questions going into college and coming out of college focus on the right things spend my time wisely and then once i've been in the field i've had some really great specifically women mentors who have helped me feel like continue uh it wasn't really like a light switch of i belong in the computer science field now there is certainly times that i feel like a bit of an imposter because i came from maybe a different background than some of my coworkers and i echo daughter specifically i've had great mentors and my current manager amanda and my previous manager marina both really helped me to see that my voice was important because it was a different voice and because it was a different perspective and that the skills that i brought to the field were important because they weren't necessarily the skills of somebody who day one knew they wanted to be a computer scientist i think it's great how the the college opportunities for studying computer science have broadened the lot in the in the recent years um but and having those more having the diverse voices in there to influence organizations and influence projects is great my dirty little secret is that i am actually a cinema major uh with a theater minor uh i do have a computer science minor because i pushed myself to finish up that section of it um but most of my work in in college was kind of using technology in these other areas so i think um there's a lot of different ways to get there and a lot of ways to to find what you love and to have that that broad diverse set of voices in the room is absolutely valuable if anybody else has any final questions we've got just a couple more minutes here um thank you uh terence stone for that question that i tried to kind of weave in there you asked about specific skills that high school students should develop but they want to be a computer science a student of computer science um before we close out here wanted to make sure i didn't miss any other questions i'm just hungry for pizza now honestly that's the that's the big thing i'm thinking about um uh eric sent me a message and he's curious about what kinds of companies do product managers work for um we've heard of like project managers and product managers a little bit different um what do you think about that what types of companies um where do you find a product manager in it's really cool because i think we're in this moment where uh project product program all of those words maybe are not agreed upon across the industry uh so i think and as i said before product management is a relatively new field uh like 15 20 years of it being like a a real named job and it is growing quickly so i think traditionally my understanding is came from bigger tech companies so google microsoft all of those big companies will have product managers they're also a pretty early hire at startups that have a technology focus but something that i really loved in coming from nonprofits is code.org's commitment to being a nonprofit and a technology company and so the idea that you can be within a nonprofit and working in with product management is something really new and cool and i think the field is going to see a lot more of that yeah i think a ship from a project which usually has a start and end to a product which is this is this is the thing we've got this is the whether it be the code.org uh online applications and website or it's an app that somebody has thinking about that in the broad sense is a shift that seems to be happening in the industry and people who can think that way are super valuable um what's the hardest part about being a product manager it's ambiguous you don't always know your role in any room it is not totally clear but you can be a helper like as you said you get to remove roadblocks bring the right people in a room then sort of the best part about being a product manager is getting to watch those around you shine and to help that happen from start until forever awesome well thank you so much for chatting with me today uh i think it's a super important role um in an organization and with uh in computer science and in software um so thank you for chatting with us today thank you for uh joining us out there teachers and students uh reminder to tune in for our future class chats and then to also check the recordings of past class chats we had a bunch of them this fall uh we had one a little while ago this spring and this one will be recorded and posted online as well to if you want to watch it again uh and then um teachers please check your email for a survey that's going to be going out we really appreciate your feedback as we continue to have these class chats in the future and keep making them even better but that's all we've got for today thank you for joining us tess thank you so much this is the blast thanks bye
