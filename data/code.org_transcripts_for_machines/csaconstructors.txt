let's say i run a sandwich shop i only sell turkey sandwiches without cheese i use a program to manage the sandwiches in my shop it has a sandwich class to represent the sandwiches i sell this sandwich class has instance variables for meat has cheese and price when a customer orders a sandwich at my shop the sandwich is created in my program by calling its constructor a constructor tells java how to create a new object and set the initial state of an object all constructors are public and have the same name as the class this constructor is a no argument constructor because it has no parameters inside the parentheses i chose the default values for the instance variables of my sandwiches in this case that means all sandwiches will have turkey for the meat false for has cheese and 299 for price now when i instantiate a my sandwich object using the no argument constructor i am creating a new sandwich object with these specific attributes if i create another sandwich object called your sandwich it will have the same values as the my sandwich object what happens when we call the sandwich constructor the my sandwich reference variable stores a pointer to the sandwich object's address in memory the my sandwich object gets a copy of the instance variables set up in the sandwich class when we call the constructor the instance variables are given value now that we can build our own constructors we can tell the computer exactly how an object should be instantiated
