foreign ER can get attacked even if you don't do anything because of vulnerabilities in the system you're using whether you're on Windows Mac Android or whatever it may be all operating systems are prone to vulnerabilities these openings allow attackers to install unwanted apps or access data in a way that you did not intend of course the company who makes this device also doesn't want this to happen so when a vulnerability is discovered a security patch or a fix is typically released as quickly as possible this is where you come in you need to install these security updates quickly ideally on the same day as they're available if you don't you're very likely exposing your personal information even if you're safely using the internet 10 or 20 years from now all the systems on the internet will probably have new protocols all emails will be encrypted and you'll probably be able to send sensitive information without worry until then your information and devices are only as secure as you make them so protect your stuff and don't get hacked foreign
