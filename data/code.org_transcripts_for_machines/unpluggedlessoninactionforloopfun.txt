okay guys for our lesson today we're going to play Four Loop fun and this is a dice game so we are going to get together in pairs and we're going to roll dice and we're going to learn how to use for Loops so first we need to talk about what for Loop is because a for Loop is different than kind of Loops we've used before so what do you remember about a loop yes it's something that repeats over and over and tell you how it to stop a a loop is something that repeats and you get to tell it when to stop right so we might have a loop and in CS fundamentals we call it a repeat block right so we might repeat something five times and the thing that we repeat five times might be something like move forward now when we repeat something five times we go through and it's it's kind of like it's keeping track one at a time so it'll have a variable if you remember that from when we were talking about um the brace bracelets or the Sun Catchers then we can have a variable that starts out at zero times and it'll go through and it'll say one and it'll go through and say two three four and five and then it'll be all done so that's how this is going to work but there's a more powerful Loop out there that we're going to learn about today and it's called the for Loop now with a for Loop we get to choose where it starts maybe we want it to start at zero maybe we want it to start at three right so we have a for Loop and then we have a variable or a counter of some kind and we're going to say for our counter and we get to say where it starts so where do we want our counter to start yeah start at 10 let's have it start at 10 so from we're going to have it start as equal to 10 and then when do we want it to stop so at 30 okay so when the counter is equal to 30 why did you write two equals that's a very good question so what I'm doing now is called PSE suda code and it's kind of like what a computer would use but it's more englishy so uh when I do this it means set that equal to 10 when I do this it means compare to see if it's equal to 10 so it's two different kinds of equals and now what do we want to add by do we want to count by ones or do we want to count by something else fives count by five that's awesome so that's going to be our Loop and while we're running our four Loop do you put stuff in variables you put stuff in variables so that you can change what happens throughout your program and still use the same word to refer to whatever that number is going to be because we don't know at any given time what the value of this is going to be we only know what ever that value is we need it so for this we're going to say counter now are we actually going to say counter counter counter no this is kind of like chorus where it means something different than what we're reading right so to start out the first time through what are we actually going to say go ahead and Shout It Out five 10 oh wait wait where are we starting 15 okay now the first time through we're going to say and then the second time through 15 and then 20 25 30 35 where do we stop there you go okay so that's how a for Loop works it lets you choose your start Point your end point and how much you count by we call that the increment can you guys say increment increment increment it's like increasing right but we're increasing something by the same amount over and over and that's how we're going to play this game dang it okay it is a dice game so you got this grid that you're going to play with and you're going to play with a partner and you're going to roll one dice and you're going to find out what your starting number is by the value of the one dice and then you're going to roll three dice or the same die three times and add them all up and that's going to be your ending number and then you'll roll to see how many you count by you'll go through and you'll Circle all the numbers as you go through by adding them all up and having the highest score yeah what if your counting number can't add up to your ending number then you do the last counting number before you get to the ending number okay all right so let's try this and I'll come around and help on the first round there are three rounds you get to play and there's a example if you want to see how other people play it okay so you're going to do your first roll here take this okay so write a four there and then make a little bracket around the four so you know that's where you're starting there you go and now you have to roll three times okay why three times because you have to get a big number a high number to know what your ending number is so it's two plus four plus 6 2 + 6 Plus four so what's 2 + 6 + 4 what's 6 + 4 10 what's 10 + 2 okay so now do one this direction around the 12 so that's how far you get to go now you have to figure out how many you get to move by okay do so write your 12 here okay you have to roll one more time is one oh that's a good roll so you put a one there so now here here's so now Circle four and now Circle every number add one add one add one and then you have to add all those up together and that's your score for the round okay this game is actually a little bit complicated so it helps if you have a document camera where you can play around with your class and show them where to start and where to stop it also helps to take the start number and make a parentheses around it and the end number and make a parentheses around it so that you can see clearly when you've gotten to your stopping point
