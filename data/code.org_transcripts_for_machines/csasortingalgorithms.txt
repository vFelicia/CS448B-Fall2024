there are many ways we can sort a list of data software engineers often use a selection sort an insertion sort for a merge sort the selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted array in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted array the list is divided into two parts the sorted part of the list is at the front end and the unsorted part is at the back end the selection sort algorithm searches for the smallest value in the uncertain part of the list it then moves it to the correct position in the sorted part the insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that shifts each item in a list one at a time to the correct position in the sorted portion of that list an insertion sort starts by comparing the first two elements it will check if the second element is smaller than the first if so it will move it in the front of the list this process continues until the element is placed at the correct location the merge sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that repeatedly breaks down a list into sublist until each sublist consists of a single element emerges those sorted sublist until it results into a sorted list merchant starts by splitting the list in half if the resulting list contains more than one item then those are split in half as well this continues until each list contains only one item now we can combine this list back into one we compare the elements in each list to combine them into sorted list with two elements this continues until we have one list with all the elements in order sorting is an important component of many programs and can often become pretty complex as the size of our list increases these sorting algorithms are commonly used by software engineers to help organize data in our programs
