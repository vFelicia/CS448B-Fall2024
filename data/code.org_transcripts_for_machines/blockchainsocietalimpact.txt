I think nonfinancial use cases of blockchain are just emerging the biggest such application currently are nfts or nonfungible tokens which represent unique assets things like Collectibles primarily today but there's been an explosion of representing other types of assets things like carbon credits real estate Securities and those kinds of things fundamentally you can think of blockchain as creating more efficient usage or exchanges in almost any Arena one way to use blockchain is to track energy and and how it's used throughout a grid and being able to then help people figure out how to use it much more efficiently any time where there's like a contract the participants they need some level of trust right and usually we bring in lawyers to do that and it's great lawyers are an awesome solution to that they're also an expensive solution to that blockchains can create situations they can't solve every problem but they can create situations where we don't necessarily need a lawyer to be involved because things that the lawyer would take care of can happen on the blockchain in a way that everyone can trust currently when we upload photos or videos we don't actually have ownership over that data so there's a huge opportunity in terms of how do we communicate with people that we love but also how do we create online what excites me most about blockchain is the opportunity to deal with the wealth Gap blockchain enables opportunity because in this space we get to deidentify ourselves and now I'm able to interact with people anonymously or pseudo anonymously with just as a series of numbers my public key and I can participate in any type of use cases that I want without having that regulation preventing me simply because you know I'm of a particular demographic or a particular gender My Hope for the future of blockchain is that we find ways to solve problems that we haven't been very good at solving Financial inclusions an obvious one blockchain technology either by itself will solve this problem or it will push governments to put in more sensible regulation to have more sensible policies on access that'll solve the problem the thing that keeps me up at night that I'm really worried about is that we will wind up whether accidentally or deliberately rebuilding the same biases that we have in our existing system foreign there definitely are environmental impacts when it comes to blockchain technology with Bitcoin it's proof of work and proof of work requires energy consumption but the value that Bitcoin brings is much higher than that energy consumption the environmental impacts are disastrous in the case of the proof of work Technologies that's Bitcoin as an example so proof of stake is another form of consensus system we have stakeholders that stake on a on a blockchain to say that this block is valid so using proof of stake we're actually not expending any electricity usage a lot of people believe that it's it's less decentralized so I think you're going to see blockchain reducing its own carbon footprint meanwhile providing Technologies and abilities that will help improve things outside of the blockchain space I believe that crypto currency in blockchain are going to continue to grow and be widely adopted it's true that it goes through Cycles so sometimes we'll see a massive runup and then a correction but if you zoom out over these from one cycle to the next it continues to grow at a really rapid Pace my biggest concern with blockchain technology is that it's developing very fast but the regulators and governments don't really understand it they don't know how to regulate it they will eventually but short term they don't and it's important to agree across countries not just in one country it's already become a an underlying layer for lots of systems and applications worldwide and so it's pretty difficult to at this point stop using blockchains do I think decentralized permissionless open networks are here to say I certainly hope so and I think Bitcoin demonstrated that they are at least that one seems to be over a decade in existence will the new one survive it's really anybody's guess it's impossible to know for any new thing we need a lot of evidence to believe that it's really going to be the next big thing and in the case of blockchain we just don't have that evidence yet blockchain's helping push the technology it's pushing ideas it's pushing competition but sometimes the first mover isn't the one who wins
