Now we're going to learn about something that all game programmers use everyday. They're called "events." An event tells your program to listen for when something happens. And then when it does, it performs an action. Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click, an arrow button, or a tap on the screen. Here, we're going to make Baymax move up to touch Hiro and move down to touch Rapunzel when the player uses the up/down arrow keys or the up/down buttons. We'll use the "when up arrow" block and attach the "move actor up" block to it, so when the player presses the up arrow key, everything attached to the "when up arrow" block is run. We'll do the same thing to make Baymax move down. Step by step your game is getting more interactive.
