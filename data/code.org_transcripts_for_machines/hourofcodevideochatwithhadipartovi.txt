okay everyone hotties gonna go ahead and join and then I'm going to introduce some and we're going to give them a big round of applause oh did you you you ok everyone welcome to the tech chat with hottie part Obi it's our last day of computer science education week so really excited to have him here and all of you to answer his your questions so why don't we go ahead and give them a big round of applause sure I just wanted to say it's a welcome thank you for that round of applause and it's just been an amazing week you know around the entire country and around the entire world classrooms we're doing the hour of code and it's it's amazing to see how this movement that just started literally two years ago has gotten to the point of complete worldwide spread you know in the United States one out of every three schools is participating in the hour of code but beyond the United States there's entire countries who are doing it in Italy and in Russia every single school is doing the hour of code and then in places like Nigeria or Syria Iraq Afghanistan places where there's Wars going on people are doing the hour of code there's Islands you know in the Indian Ocean there's a small island called Cocos Island where every single inhabitant every person on the island is doing the hour of code it's unbelievable to have started something two and a half years ago that has picked up so much in terms of worldwide spread and it everybody believes that learning the basics of computer science is something all of our students need some access to it's so fun to be doing this thank you so much for joining me okay so thanks howdy we're going to go to our first school Emerson Elementary and Texas versus great questions the question is how much has coating changed today versus a few years ago you know if you'll be two years ago three years ago it hasn't changed very much but if you go back ten or twenty years it's changed a whole lot those of you who are doing the draganddrop sort of dragging the commands whether it's on tablets or on computers where you're not actually typing the draganddrop method of coding has only been around a little bit more than ten years and that makes it so much easier to learn you know before that anybody who have to code needed to jump strut straight in in two times and it's not that the typing is hard but it's it's much easier to make mistakes because if you spell something just a little bit wrong the computer doesn't recognize it whereas when you're dragging and dropping it's easier and before you had to you had a chance to type you know 30 40 years ago computers didn't even have keyboards the only thing they had was little readers that you had put a piece of cardboard into this is before I was born but you know there would be little pieces of cards and people would actually punch holes in them and put that little piece of card and the computer would find the holes and those holes would represent ones or zeros and that would tell the computer what the program was that was way way harder had but and it's got become easier every year it's going to become a little bit easier so twenty years from now it will be much much easier than it is today great our next school is Clayton Elementary from Canada classic what made you want to create the hour of code um so I didn't you know want to create the hour of code it's more like how did the idea come about you know I started code org because I it myself that's such a great I think her in the tech industry and I felt like it was so lucky that I got a chance to be even doing this you know when I started coding I lived in the country of earu and I grew up there during a war which was really not a great place to be raising a child but my dad gave me a computer one day and it didn't have any games on it and he said here's a book and if you can learn how to read the book you can figure out how to code and make your own games and apps and because I did by the time our family came to America even though we didn't have very yeah I was really good at coding and that helped me get some of the best jobs and I'm suited to be the American dream and I started code.org because I realized most schools it's not thirty since I started learning computer programming and still most schools in this country or really in any country including Canada don't give students the most basic exposure that I got when I was little and the opportunity that I'm living is one that most kids will never unlock in their lives if they don't get the same access in school great our next question is from Galileo STEM Academy and Idaho what types of problems or challenges did you come across when you created our code don't know I think it's tried again what types of problems or challenges did you come across when you created our oh good um when we created our of code by far the hardest problem was how little time we had you know the idea for the hour of code basically gelled together after many months of we know we're trying to figure out what could we do that everybody could participate in because you know 15,000 schools had reached out to code org at that point saying we want your help bringing computer all these Paulson's and celebrities and we'll just walk but to help us and we weren't sure what we could do that could engage all schools and all the people and then the idea for an a code came together at June 2013 in lieu so we had five and a half months to put together at that point I think there was me three or four of us at a code of we is if it wasn't Justin's we needed to do our schools you know read all these schools aren't able to get the present state they're all about but the hardest problem was a few people we had and hiring those people quickly enough and getting them on board and managing an incredibly tight time schedule but one thing we learned actually there's two things we learned one was that by setting an incredibly high goal you know we we shot for the you know we figured let's shoot for the moon and reach the Stars which is the opposite of how most people we set the goal of reaching 10 million students in one week and that was such a big goal that it got a lot of people behind us and the other thing we learned is that you know because computer science education and learning to code is something that everybody supports even the most ridiculous request we we made of people you know people came through for us so you know even that first hour of code Google promoted it on their home page and we only had to ask once and that happened or you know the way the hour of code has been put into every single Apple store people have asked me how did you get them to do that it was actually the opposite they asked us if they could do that it was their idea which is really unheard of because you know most people don't get that much sort of free promotion and partnership from Apple and really we realized it's such a movement that everybody wants to help and that made it much more successful great our next question comes from Minnesota from North elementary school how is the concept of code.org created so the original concept of code.org was very different than where we are today when I started at the time it was basically just a hobby and all I wanted to do is make one video that explains that computer programming in computer science and coding are important and that you know our schools should be teaching it and our students should be learning it and this was kind of I wasn't working at the time and this was just sort of a side project for me and I recruited some of the best people that I knew or that I had contacts to in the tech industry to help so people like Bill Gates the the founder of Microsoft and the wealthiest man in the world or Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook or Jack Dorsey the founder of Twitter or you know bunch of these people I knew from working with them and then there were a handful of celebrities that I managed to call their agents and said you know I'm doing this thing with these other people can they be part of it and my only goal in life was just to make this video it took a few you know about six months we'll put the video down out on a website and then that was it um there really wasn't a plan for what we do next um but as the video game came together I realized I can't just put this video on my own personal YouTube page and you know it's got all these important people on it it kind of needs a website that's oh I need to have a website that the video goes on so you know I managed to get the name code.org and then put the video on the website and then having this video with all these important people on this website with such a great name created such a stir that a million sorry 10 million people looked at it in a week and 15,000 schools reached out and said you know can you help us bring this to her to our school and at that point literally it was just me in a video and this like really barebones websites but when we had you know the attention of 10 million people and 15,000 schools wanting computer science that's really what inspired me and it's it's really actually all the educators who wanted to bring computer science to their students into their classrooms that was the inspiration for making what is today the current code org and your since then I've been basically building a team hiring people building all the pieces of what code.org does whether it's the tutorials the hour of code everything great and that's how I ended up here Laura was actually I think maybe you know she was one of the first three people I met back then and convinced to join us hey our next question comes from Woodfin elementary school in North Carolina so I was 10 years old so I think I was in 4th grade at that time which is you know most people were early but I think had you know as we've shown with the hour of code it's not early that's like the right time for people to learn and back when I started the programming language I used was called basic on a computer called a Commodore 64 and back then computers were kind of bigger it was like this really big thing that didn't didn't have a mouse they didn't have color screens your programming wasn't nearly as much fun because you couldn't make really cool things but still the ability to tell a computer what to do and have it do it for you was really exciting AB and here there's a particular magic that you sense when you tell a computer to do one thing and then you tell it can you do that a thousand times and it does it a thousand times instant then you certainly realizing the computer can do something for you millions of times just by adding a few more zeros on the number it gives you just a real sense of power that you know there's nowhere else in the world there were no other way that you can say you know I want a million of something and you get it with instantaneous reaction and I think that was one of the lies about the power of these platforms great and our next question comes from tills elementary school in Arkansas um we've seen a significant interest in computer science since you gave me algorithm if the trend continues where you see Khoda continues so the question is where will I see coding in ten years you know my goal and the goal of code.org is that every school should teach computer science and you know the people should be learning this field you know we don't do an hour of math at once a year or an hour of science once a year you have like math all the time and science hopefully all the time or English reading writing these are things that are just part of school but computer science and coding aren't part of school and it's not like somebody's decided that they're not allowed to be part of schools just that they're kind of new most of what you learned in school is the same exact thing everybody's been learning for 150 years you know Matt hasn't changed in a thousand years the basics of multiplication and addition or subtraction or division those things have existed for as long as humanities existed it's not like somebody invented that or came up with it it's just counting and the English language also hasn't changed too much it's changing in thousand the last thousand years in the last hundred years it hasn't changed very much and so people have been teaching the same things as ever but computer programming computers have only been around you know less than a hundred years about 60 years and computer programming at the level at which a you know 10 year old can do it has only been possible for about 30 years and one one one thing that means is most of your teachers most of your parents have never done it themselves and most teachers parents adults are actually a little bit scared of it they think I'm not smart enough to do it and because it's new and different and I never learned it so if I never learned it you know maybe I can't do it myself so the the real challenge to getting this taught in schools is to the adults the parents all recognize that even if it's too scary for them or too new for them or foreign for them that it's not scary or foreign for today's children where we want to be in 10 years is that every school should teach computer science just like they teach math or English or science or biology it should be part of the full school system not just this thing you do one hour a year you know the one hour is just you know it's a great way to have fun and it's a great way to realize how much more than one hour there is to learn and it will go beyond one hour and do a much more learning whether it's using our tutorials or somebody else's great and we have a question from our Twitter feed this is from a student and Denver Colorado and they want to know what's something you'd want to make yourself with code that's a great question ad so there's two things I want to make myself with code and they're both pretty recent one is for my staff for the code or team I was hoping to make a Christmas card using our artist you know we have this little thing whether it's the Anna and Elsa version or the the default artist version where you give commands to draw squares or circles or Pentagon's or stars and I wanted to have that draw a Christmas tree and the particular challenge I wanted to give myself is to make it dry fractal Christmas tree where you know each branch itself is a little Christmas tree and each branch of the branch is a little Christmas tree M which is a little bit harder to do so I'm gonna need to maybe take some time over the Christmas break to do that's the other thing I want to make you know we've recently made this thing called app lab which makes it really easy to make apps and at the code.org offices we have a pingpong table right now in front of me but there's a wall next to the pingpong table where everybody has written their scores of hoobie tomb and it's literally written on the wall and we're running out of space on the wall so I was hoping to make an app so we can track the pingpong scores on set inside the code or team to see who's has the most wins and and who's at the top of the ranks awesome well thanks howdy for joining us today in all these classrooms and we just wanna give you a big round of applause I wanted to say something in closing before I leave which is whether it's the students or the teachers please don't stop with one hour after all of you teachers over there I'm sure you can you can look em co.org we have tons of followon curriculum that you can take and if you haven't it those of you who are in elementary school in particular we have these great training workshops that are oneday workshops for teachers to basically learn going curriculum for your students and for the students whose teachers don't decide to do this first of all ask them to do it and tell them you want to do more coding but if you don't get to do it in the classroom I hope you can convince your mom or dad to go do it at home on a computer at home so thank you so much and please spread the word right I think sorry
