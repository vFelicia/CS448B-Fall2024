Unplugged activity | move it, move it. This lesson is called move it, move it. Together we're going to write a program to get our friends from the starting spot with the compass rose to the smiley face goal. But the smiley is face down and only one person knows how to get there. Let's get this program started. A program is an algorithm that has been coded into something that can be run by a machine. Most of us think of a program as something that we write for a computer. Programs are really good for that but they're also helpful in other places. You can make your own game or even program a robot to do things for you.
