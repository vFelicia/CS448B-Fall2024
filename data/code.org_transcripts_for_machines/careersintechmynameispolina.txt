my name is pauline guskova i'm a data scientist at electronic arts and my job is to build the machine learning components for the player and developer experience team if i was to give some advice it would be just to follow your passion just to explore your interests if you love gaming then great figure out how the games are built and i think that's how a lot of people actually started out at ea they wanted to learn how the games were built they wanted to build their own games and they went out and did that for me i was really interested in machine learning and the idea of doing that in the context of video games just sounded really awesome and right now i love it because there's so much opportunity still left when i was younger i remember my dad was a grad student and i would spend hours at a robotics lab so i saw all the newest tech as soon as it came out i remember dialup connections i remember every version of the mp3 player and since my dad was an early adopter and i was surrounded by this i kind of grew up with the expectation that i would be coding and i kind of viewed coding as a necessary skill and so i went to engineering school i studied science i studied math i took all of the necessary classes but what got me really excited was machine learning and all of the really cool applications and how you can teach computers to do things that only humans were previously able to do and so at electronic arts you can think about how instead of just getting a game that's the same game as everyone else you can get a game that's personalized to you where the content is unique to what you're interested in and then the difficulty is adjusted to what's fun for you and that's what the world's moving towards i remember when i was taking programming in high school it was a really small class and they're really only two girls in the whole class and it just had these nerdy connotations and now many years later it's become so much more popular there's so many people and so many resources to help you get into it and so many applications so even if you're not interested in just being a programmer even if you're interested in biology or if you're interested in political science there's so many applications for it and it's such an important skill that i would highly recommend that everyone try it out
