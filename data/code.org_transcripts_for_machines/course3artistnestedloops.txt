when you put a loop inside of another loop we call that a nested loop for example here we're given the code all ready to draw one triangle with sides of length 100 pixels using the repeat times block set to 3 once for each side of a triangle but we want to draw six triangles in order to do that we're going to take that loop and place it inside another repeat times block pretty cool
