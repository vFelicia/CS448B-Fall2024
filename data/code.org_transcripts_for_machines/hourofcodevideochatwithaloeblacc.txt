thank you so much everybody for joining us today I'd like to welcome a low block to our hour of code chat all of the successful recording artist best known for performance also is passionate about technology and teaches students about digital compression and one of codes per coulomb videos so everybody please give me a big warm welcome to Ella back how you doing everybody it's good to see you and I'm glad I had a chance to talk to you guys and answer some questions we're so happy you can be here today i lo so our first question comes from Jordans class in Oakland smash ramen we're Island computer science I started coding at the age of 14 some wondering when was the first time you heard about computer science first time I heard about computer science I was about six years old my dad bought an app a Commodore 64 computer and used to bring home magazines that that taught people who had these early computers how to basically how to build them themselves but they also had codes so that the adults could teach their kids how to do like really simple and fun designs in in the in the computer so I was really young when I learned about it just because you know my dad was sort of geeky into that stuff awesome I'm great to hear it our next question comes from Adams classroom in Vancouver Washington I see we've been a big heart poster for a low thanks guys hey my name is pocket wells and my question is how have you seen technology change the music industry and what role do you see it having in the future technology has changed the music industry in a lot of ways one of which is the distribution method when I first started making music I was selling cassettes and then I was selling vinyl and I was selling CDs but nowadays it's very infrequent that someone purchases a CD or a cassette or or vinyl now music is distributed through the internet and so we've gone from a physical world to a streaming world and a digital download world that has been the most dramatic change I've seen in the music industry another huge change has been the technology we used to make music you know when I was growing up I joined the school band and I played the trumpet but when I started actually using and producing music I was no longer using instruments I was using computers and and beat machines so technologies had you know multiple has affected the music business in multiple ways thanks for sharing how how music is changing thanks to technology ello our next question comes from Lawrence's class and they're actually local to us in Seattle hi my name is Elena from girl Checotah Ingram and we were wondering if you could create an application to make your life easier what would it be and why an application that would make my life easier would be a songwriting application if I could just press a button and the song would be written already and all I had to do was sing it that would be awesome I actually met a guy in Boulder Colorado who was working on a program that could mimic and model any artists style and he said that he had basically built this computer learning system to mimic and model even my style so they his computer basically could could write a song in my own way I mean in my own style hopefully he doesn't try to compete with me in the marketplace that would be crazy very cool to hear about that we're going to go to Meredith's classroom in Portland Oregon I would attribute it to number one skill so when I was in high school is when I started recording I started writing lyrics when I was nine years old writing rap lyrics because I thought I was gonna be a rapper but singing eventually was the way that I was able to break into the music industry but because I've been writing lyrics for so long from age nine up until I got signed to my first recording deal at age 25 I had about 16 years of experience and there are some theorists who say if you dedicate 10,000 hours to anything you can become a master at it and because I had dedicated so much time to songwriting I believe that skill I would attribute skill to my success today but I think it's also just finding the right mentors and the people who can support my career I've had a lot of great people offer me opportunities that have have been tremendous help to my career awesome it's so inspiring we hear people say that you know often the the biggest key to success is just practice and continuing to do something for a long time until you really get good at it for our last question we're going to go to evergreen high school hi my name is alvaro Khan and I'm from Evergreen Valley High School's girls who code my question is what inspired you to go into music and what advice you have for other aspiring musicians well I was inspired to make music because it helped me channel my creative energy and I've been doing it for so long that it was just my hobby I ended up going to the University of Southern California after high school and after my college experience I went to work as a business consultant and all during that time I continue to make music because it was just my passion it's something that I love to do even though it wasn't my day job eventually what happened was I lost my job I got laid off and as I contemplated going back to school to get a masters or PhD or going back to the workforce to find another job I just continued to make music and think positive things started happening and I never had to to look for another job and I'm I think you know it's so it's pretty lucky that I was able to do this but I'm really glad that I I went through school and I finished school and I got that experience and all of the education that I have because it helps me to do the business that I do now awesome so to top off our chat we're just gonna welcome in Maddie who's our social media Wiz and she's taken a few questions from people who are watching live on Twitter okay hi everyone I'm excited to be here so first we have a tweet from Caitlyn from Nashville Tennessee and she wants to know alo what inspired you to make your own website and how long did it take you to learn how to build it what inspired me was a class that I had and I was taking at the University of Southern California USC this is back in 1997 I took prevent class and we all had to create our own website so it didn't take very long to figure it out and it was all for me just basic HTML plus we had some you know graphic user interface tools back then it was like Netscape was our browser and we had an Netscape also had a a web a web authoring platform so you could create your website in a graphical environment without having to do all the code and that made it a lot easier but that was what inspired me it was basically a class it didn't take very long maybe a couple weeks that's awesome umm I bet all the kids are really excited to hear about that but it didn't take very long to figure out and it's very inspiring right alright uh Gabrielle from Miami Florida wants to know what are your favorite apps or technology inventions favorite apps technology inventions I love right now my my favorite technology invention is 360degree camera I don't know how much of you are familiar with the this new format of video but on YouTube you can watch videos in 360 and I found a company called Jai Rob dick that makes a 360 camera because I was just so interested in it I want to be able to tell stories not just their music but visually as well and when I went to Ted in Vancouver Canada in February I had a chance to view documentary that was done in a Syrian refugee camp and it was in 360 I was wearing the Samsung gear VR and I was transported to the Syrian refugee camp which basically humanized the issue it's no longer no longer just people over there that are suffering it was I'm now in the in the shoes of a 13 year old Syrian refugee girl who was telling narrating her story and that really impressed me and I thought this new technology this 360 video this VR world can be used for education and delivering messages of empathy and compassion that's fantastic thanks so much for sharing that's all the questions we have on our end could everybody join me in giving hallo a great big round of applause thank you
