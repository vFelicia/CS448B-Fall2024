hello and welcome to code break my name is hakati there are tens of thousands of people joining us about a thousand folks on the zoom call and about ten thousand more on facebook live and youtube live together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom with so many students at home my team at code.org invites families everywhere to join us for a weekly dose of inspiration community and computer science this is my daughter and sidekick sophia hello she's a budding computer scientist please spread the word and invite others to join us the larger the audience the bigger this classroom will be i'd like to invite our first special guest keegan michael key actor and producer you probably know him from playing with fire or as a hyena on the lion king whereas ducky from toy story 4. keegan are you there with us today i'm here honey good to see you hi sophia it's great to see you how are you doing where are you calling from calling from los angeles california and uh and oh it's a nice foggy day here and um ready to have some fun with you guys and how have you been spending your time during the last six weeks well well um uh elle my wife and i have been um we have been working we have uh television shows that we produce that are still going and and we are doing some other work with um audio stuff that you know it can be done while we're in um while we're in lockdown so we've been just trying to kind of maintain our lives here and uh and keep our projects going so it's great to be to be productive even though you're at home do you have any message for students who are basically home and you know with school closed a billion students around the world have not nowhere to study or know where to go do you have any masters to help them just kind of stay focused during their day and think about how to make the most out of this time yeah i think if you if if they have opportunities to talk to their friends they can even though we're not together we can still share ideas and we can share ideas with our friends and also i think now's a good time since since we're we're all to get probably together kids are probably together with their families with their parents that maybe there's something that they don't know that they might think their parent might be an expert on or ask just ask their parents questions about when they were young what they were interested in and then you can learn something new beyond even school even online school so i think that's one thing is just is staying as connected to each other as we can so that we so and so that i know it's not a normal situation but if you have the opportunity to uh learn something our parents are like a wealth of knowledge for us so sophia you know that right your dad's pretty interesting guy he's got some stuff going on right you can learn some stuff from him i'm learning from her and vice versa and vice versa yep so sophia is going to start us off with the uh the computer joke of the day with sophia she also has a little soundtrack because we're kind of low tech but she makes sounds on her iphone but sophia asked keegan your joke of the day okay keegan why can't you email a picture to a jedi um gosh why can't i don't know sophia why can't you send is it send a picture yeah why can't you send a picture to a jedi email the jedi code for bid attachments it actually officially does forbid attachments it forbids attachments oh my gosh really we write our own jokes at code.org we're pretty excited i like it so we're gonna switch to gallery mode so everybody who's uh on the zoom call can see all the faces and we're gonna unmute everybody and so everybody can say hi and tell us all at one time all right uh thanks everybody and we're going to go back on youth there's a few dozen folks all on camera but i also want to share where everybody's calling in from on the zoom call when you were joining uh we added a little qr code so people could put their location on a map so oh wow here all over the world all over the world are there any spots that you see that surprise you that you didn't expect to see people calling in from um i was not expecting to see someone calling in from wherever northern wherever they are in northern russia is that siberia where is that i feel like whoever's calling in there is shivering um it's very cool that is amazing oh and iceland rake somebody's calling from reykjavik what's this here what's that little number three in the north pacific ocean is that hawaii that's hawaii let's go up to hawaii yeah it's i think 7am in hawaii and it's well after midnight wherever oh and look right in here somebody's going from eritrea or ethiopia right there in eastern africa i like that yep i was not necessarily expecting to sit and then and then there's uh there's an uh a green is that person irish no and they're not irish and you know how you get to be green on our map all right uh also just to give you a sense of who the audience is we have folks uh joining on multiple different areas but they range from all ages from six year olds all the way to 60 year olds and different levels of experience either beginner computer scientists or even some advanced students for those of you who are advanced we're going to get to advanced stuff later in the episode for those of you who are beginners please stick with us even if things go too quickly for you you'll you should be able to keep up okay i'm going to try to keep up i'm a beginner i'm going to try to keep up all right we have four parts that we're gonna be talking about today part one we're gonna be learning about the internet part one we're gonna learn about protocols then we're gonna learn about internet addresses and then we're gonna have the vint surf quiz show with the inventor of the internet and then lastly we're going to learn about web pages wow okay cool before we start i want to welcome some students to demo their creations from last week last week we we were with bill gates and challenged students to make their own virus simulation or to visualize chrono virus data and each week when you share your creations with us we'll invite the best ones on next week's episode so we have two folks we wanted to invite to join us can we unmute victoria victoria hi there i'm here buddy hi victoria and victoria you're a teacher is that right that is correct at coral ridge elementary in louisville kentucky louisville kentucky all right yes awesome and can you share with us and with with keegan what it is that you built after last week well um you all had made the simulation about um how the coronavirus spreads and i added the nurse who provides vaccines and it can help stop the coronavirus from going to the other characters once it gets a vaccine it no longer can get covet 19 and i'll also change the background to the subway um in order to honor new york because of how bad the chronovirus has spread there that's very sweet victoria all right i'm going to screen share so we can see victoria's modification of our app so this is going to load inside our app lab tool and as you described it you basically have the there's a virus that's going to be going around infecting folks there's the virus that's covered up by the nurse i guess uh you can't see them both oh there they go so the virus is going and infecting people and your nurse is going to go and try to vaccinate people you have to um i'm going to double click this she has to get to the purple ones or the green ones first before the virus can get to them do you have to move her over to them no she's wandering and you have actually a screen share this is what it should look like when it moves do they change colors as a period of time has gone on and they're no longer infected um when the nurse comes in contact with the purple or green monsters that is like administering the vaccine and they turn the teal blue they're perfectly protected see yes they turn teal blue and on their belly it says covid19 with a circle and a slash so that shows that that they are immune and so if they touch the pink monsters they don't get it anymore because they have the vaccine gotcha gotcha yeah all right can we also unmute rifky for a second rifky where are you calling us from i'm calling you from kuala lumpur malaysia kuala lumpur in malaysia what time is it over there it's already 1 11. it's 1 11 in the morning i can't believe your parents let you stay up that late i guess that is what it takes for the folks who are calling all the way from from that far east uh so i'm gonna screen share your app briefly uh so that you took the app that we made the tracks the sort of data the spread of the coronavirus to show the number of cases in malaysia is that right yes that is correct everybody who joined us last week you can modify the app that we sent you to bring in live data from any country or state and then you modified these buttons so what are these different buttons doing the support local stalls when you press it you will go to a web it takes me to this webpage to about how to support coronavirus how to support local stalls in kuala lumpur and then these other buttons give more updates about corona virus in kuala lumpur and malaysia and hospitals in malaysia yes that's wonderful that's amazing yeah keegan so every week we we basically have students we share about a little bit of code and something we create and we challenge students to to make their own things as well so let's get started with today's lesson we're going to learn about the internet and today's word of the day is going to be protocol a protocol is a set of rules that a computer can use to talk to another computer it's basically what controls how computers send messages to each other a few episodes ago we learned about how information on computers is stored with ones and zeros like how images can be stored in ones and zeros and now what we're going to show is how you can send image data over a connection the connection we have right now is a visual connection so we're going to use light for sending the information but you could use light or electricity or sound or radio waves sophia is going to use a light bulb she's got a flashlight here and when she turns it on that's be a one and when she turns it off that's gonna mean a zero so on means one off in zero and what we want each of you to do is to write down the message that she sends but it's gonna be a graphic message so i want you all to make a two by two grid on a piece of paper okay so if you've got a piece of paper whether you're on the zoom call or whether you're watching on youtube or facebook make a two by two grid and when you get the ones and zeroes from sofia she's going to send a message of ones and zeros and one means white as you learned earlier a few weeks ago and zero means black so a message like that is going to translate into this image which is just a small set of pixels and images uh so before we start is everybody ready with your two by two grids okay all right can everybody share their two by two grids show them up on the screen so we can see them yep i'm ready yep can you hold up your pieces of paper so we can see your grids everybody are we all good all right so sophia we're going to get started and sophia is going to send the first message sophie are you ready yes keegan are you ready i'm ready all right ready set go okay i think all right all right so sophia sent you her message for this 2x2 grid all right so let's switch to gallery view and see what folks saw what folks draw what did you all draw keegan what did what did you draw for us could we can we this is what i got that's what i got is that is that right is that what you sent us no no how did you get that this this is the first one that's not the first one that's that's a one let's see what other half that's the one and that's that's the zero let's see what it let's see the gallery and see what other students drew all right there's all sorts of different pictures all right sophia can you share with us what you actually wanted to send as a message so it was a black white white black all right ken's white white black somebody who got something different uh let's can can somebody who uh raise your hand if you want to explain why you didn't get the same answer we'd like to see from the audience if you could raise your hand and see who's interested physically um and let me pick somebody i'm gonna unmute you zineb where are you calling us from london london and let's show us what you got what did you draw right so black black white black white huh right yeah so why was it hard for you to to get the message that sofia sent she went really fast he went really fast and the other thing is you couldn't tell how many blacks were coming in a row or how many whites were coming in a row yeah right because she had the flashlight on and that was for two whites two ones in a row but there's no real way of figuring out how many ones there are how many zeros which means white and an on is one which means white all right so then if so in in the grid the first box would have been then on and then on and then off okay then on on and then off gotcha okay all right so what we're doing not like that yes i'm not writing zeros i'm filling in because one okay all right all right okay i think i got it i think i got it all right right so how's it going another time but what we're going to do is improve on our protocol because the reason that protocol was tough partly because i went too fast for zineb but the other reason is because it was hard to know how many ones or zeros i was sending or sophia was sending so what we're going to do is add a timer so i'm going to snap and each time i snap then look at sophia's flashlight at the time of the snap to see what it is that way you can see the different ones and zeros now to do this we're gonna make it a little bit harder so draw everybody can you draw a three by three grid now three by three oh like a tic tac okay gotcha yeah like a tictactoe board and we're to send nine different ones and zeros okay there's going to be nine of them now okay each one is going to come with a snap and i want everybody in the audience not just on camera to do it so even if you're on youtube or facebook we're going to ask you to draw this and then at the end we're going to ask you via a poll to see if you got the right answer so sophie are you ready for this yes slow and steady and all right are you ready okay here we go all right there's gonna be nine different ones and zeros and with a snap to see if you get it on time ready set go all right i hope that wasn't too fast for zaneb or for any students and i hope the snaps made it easier to tell when there was ones and when there were zeros we're gonna do a poll for the entire audience on zoom there's about 1500 students sophia's ones and zeros spent spelled out a letter on the grid uh so let's see a poll was that a letter t was it an x was it a d or a c we have students answering in to collect the various results so different students got different answers but i can already tell that the most students got the answer that sophia was sending okay um okay and i am going to do the thing honey i have two letters yeah let's see keegan what did you get what okay so i have two letters hi hi keegan so i think that was sort of regritified in some way i am not getting the hang of this here hold on a second i mean that's pretty good can we switch to gallery view and see what this other what the students on camera see what everybody else got here what did everybody else get all right different people a lot of you got the right letter there and can we show what the poll results showed from the students in the audience the poll results showed that most people 46 percent of you got the right answer and this indeed is the right this is what sophia was trying to do if we can switch back to put me on camera did any did anybody else be an h did anybody else get an h and an i did anybody get an agent and i i don't think so no okay just me oh just me okay all right i must have been seeing little uh sub snaps i was hearing some snaps so what you saw there is the zeros and ones sent by a flashlight is literally how information is sent on the internet whether it's on a light wave on a sent on glass or whether it's an electrical wave uh sent on a wire and on on the actual internet and in computers there's actually a clock matching my snaps to make the difference between when it's a zero or when it's a one so if there's multiple zeros in a row these are these are changing not once a second like me but literally billions of times a second really buyer goes on and off to send this information and a protocol as we learned is just like the rules we set that we set as you know an on means of one or the snap is how you know what's going on protocols are how on the internet this information is sent on how the computers know how to communicate amazing amazing that's pretty incredible it's literally what we did is how information is sent on the internet every little thing you get on the internet is sent in a similar kind of way we want to do something else since you're going to be our first special guest who's going to play a new thing with us called a lightning round of questions you got okay we have an app that we've made here and sophia is going to put 60 seconds on the clock and she's going to keep score to see how many questions you can get done in 60 seconds 60 seconds for our future guests the high score right now is a zero okay i think i can do better than that i hope by yes hopefully you can beat the high school beat zero all right sophia are you ready yes keegan are you ready i am ready all right go okay the last person you have not living with you say it again we'll see if i lost in the middle the last person you hugged not living with you not living you uh doug lyman next question as a kid what did you want to be when you grew up veterinarian what is a superhero power you wish you had i would love to be able to fly first thing you can do in the morning uh i drink a cup of earl grey tea 30 seconds strangest thing in your refrigerator uh strange thing refrigerator uh uh duck liver pate okay your favorite smell uh my favorite smell is my favorite smell is beef stroganoff the the i like wow what's the best advice you've ever gotten what's the best advice you've ever gotten say that again hottie we're out of time in the lightning round but what is the best advice you've ever gotten um the best advice i've ever gotten let me see what is the best advice i've ever gotten appreciate appreciate appreciate that's beautiful yeah well thank you keegan and do you have any final messages for our students who are all studying at home well just just keep on keep at it everybody and this is a wonderful wonderful skill and if you enjoy something you should do it because it might move you by the way yes of course six you beat the high school i beat the high score yeah yeah that's six um and also i want to tell all the kids to watch next week thank you so much and let's switch to gallery view and have all the students wave goodbye and thank you so much keegan for joining us thank you guys for part of your day with us okay take care byebye all right so we've learned today that protocols are what makes the internet work and we learned how to send messages back and forth with ones and zeroes uh and how those create rules for how to send messages now sophie and i are going to jump into code.org internet simulator for the next part of our episode which is going to teach us about internet addresses internet addresses and what we're going to do is we're going to use something inside code.org called the internet simulator i'm going to screen share this briefly so here we are in the internet simulator we have four people here in a room now imagine these are four computers all connected on the internet via wires everybody's connected to each other and we're gonna send messages to each other there's four people sophia hannah akira and darius darius is my my son hannah and kira help me with running code break and what we're going to do is we're sending messages to each other instead of with ones and zeros they're going to be with letters but it's very similar as to how the internet works and what i want to do is sofia if you could send messages to akira back and forth and darius and hannah if you could communicate with each other i want you each to ask each other what your birthday is so if you could send messages asking each other sophia to akira hannah and darius to each other so sophia is sending her answer all right so akira's asking from from sophia and darris and hannah sent their messages back and forth all right darius darius can you speak up are you there yes so so you were asking from hannah so what is hannah's birthday what did you learn um i have no idea because it doesn't say who any of the messages are from or who they're to it doesn't say who the messages are from or too so we know a bunch of these birthdays but not who they're from or to the other thing is everybody's seeing everybody's birthday you're not just seeing hannah's message uh and what could cause a problem with that if you know on the internet if things are all public well i mean if you're trying to send personal information that you don't want everyone to know then like everybody can see it which is obviously better exactly what most people don't realize is when you're on the internet every single thing that is sent back and forth is going on a series of wires that literally the entire world could tap into and see every single bit of it and the only way to protect that information is to encrypt it as we learned a few episodes to go with ashton kutcher if you're on a web page if you see this little lock here at the where you see my mouse pointing in the upper left that lock means that the information that's being sent back and forth is encrypted if there's not a lock there literally everything that's you're sending or receiving back can be seen by every single other person but now let's deal with how to fix the problem of you couldn't tell whose name was which what can we do if we do the same exact thing and you you four communicate with each other to make it more clear i mean you could put your name before the message and who you're sending it to all right so let's do that so let's do it again sophia to akira and back and forth and say to whom and from whom and we're inventing a new change to our protocol to include the address of who the message is from into the question well why don't you ask each other your favorite flavor of ice cream so to akira from sophia what is your favorite ice cream is that correct okay yeah and everybody's sending messages to sophia from akira what is your favorite ice cream from hannah to darius what is your favorite ice cream so sophia what is akira's favorite ice cream um she loves salted caramel and darius did you learn what hannah's favorite ice cream is yes mint chocolate chip mint chocolate chip so what we just did is basically we invented an addition to our protocol where we put the two address and the from address from so that everybody's message you can tell who it's coming from and who it's coming to and this is literally how things work on the internet just as we learned with the flashlights the messages are sent in ones and zeros but they need addresses for who they're going to and who they're coming from we used first names but that's not what we use on the internet because we aren't on a first name basis with every single computer on the internet but but in fact every computer on the internet has an address called an ip address and ip stands for internet protocol the internet protocol basically says how with ones and zeros computers talk with each other and every single device on the internet even if it's your phone has a unique 64digit long address that is one long number that helps know who the message is coming from who it's coming to and so using ones and zeros every time you send a text message every time you receive a video on youtube whatever it is that you're doing on the internet these ones and zeros spell out the two address and the from address when you get an answer back from google google says sends a message from google to your computer's address to do that now i want to introduce someone who knows a lot about the internet protocol we're going to play a short video to introduce them so let's go to the video hopefully it's not laggy it probably might be i don't have any idea where the internet came from and it just doesn't matter they don't need to it's sort of like asking who invented the ballpoint pen or the flush toilet or you know the zipper these are all things we just use every day we don't even think about the fact that one day somebody invented them so the internet is just like that many many years ago in the early 1970s my partner bob khan and i began working on the design of what we now call the internet it all right vince are you there with us vince surf are you there yes i i am i had to unmute and it took a moment to do that thank you very much for inviting me to join the show and i certainly enjoyed the the preamble with keegan that was a lot of fun i tried to do uh the uh the examinations that sophia gave us and i have to tell you there's one thing missing from the protocol that you introduced the timing was extremely important but the other thing that wasn't clear to me since i wasn't around for earlier shows is in which order the bits were supposed to be placed in the matrix another yeah so if you don't get the order correct you won't be able to get the shape of the letter correctly fortunately i took left to right top to bottom as my assumption for putting the bits into the nine three by three array but i could have been wrong because you could have picked another convention so but the example of needing to make decisions like that and make it clear you know what the protocol is what the parameters are is absolutely essential to successful communication absolutely and by the way for folks who are joining us vince just recently recovered from the coronavirus we are so lucky to have him on this show and on this episode uh it's just incredible that that somebody who's had this much impact on the world around us uh is somebody who we almost lost thanks to this this virus that is affecting our entire world we're so lucky to have you with us if anybody has questions for events you can use code.org questions to submit them or if you're on facebook you can submit them in the comments what i what i'd like to suggest next is usually we run polls for the students for the students to basically answer questions as a trivia question but with you here vince we're going to do things a little differently we'd like to host a quiz show so everybody can play along and we're going to have you ask the questions of the audience and the audience is going to do this via polls and if they don't show up on your screen i can read out the questions and you can help answer them so let's go with the first question so the first question is why was the internet invented in the first place option a to make persontoperson computer chat possible b is to have a communication network that could survive a nuclear war and c is to play games with friends uh and we have about 1500 students answering this poll so we're going to wait until a lot of the answers come in half of them have already voted on their answers and there's lots of pretty unique different answers four percent people all right if we could show the answers on screen right so vince uh about 50 people said that it was sorry fifty percent said is to have a communication network that could survive a nuclear war forty five percent said to the persontoperson computer chat possible about four percent said it's to play games with friends so uh tell us why did you invent the internet with your team there well it wasn't exactly to build something that would survive a nuclear war and i'm not sure that even today's internet would survive but it was intended to provide a platform for the defense department the u.s defense department to build a command and control system and so uh to the extent that we sort of think of command and control and nuclear war is somehow being related uh the uh the second answer is probably an accurate initial answer but it lets us do all those other things that that you listed and a whole bunch of other things that you didn't list like what we're doing right this moment so the answer is it wasn't designed for a particular purpose it was designed as a platform to support all kinds of applications if you could just figure out how to program them and also a big difference about the design relative to previous communication networks is that it was fault tolerance so in the event of a war attack with things being wrong it could stay up did you ever dream that it would be used this way when you when you did this work yes because when you think about command or control it's all about interactions of you know people trying to cooperate and collaborate with each other and so that works in the civilian sector too when we've seen the internet grow in that way the its predecessor the arpanet was designed to share resources among computer science departments in the u.s they were doing research on artificial intelligence and so we saw electronic mail we saw distribution lists we saw remote access to computing we saw file transfers and then of course in the early 1990s tim bernerslee invented the world wide web which enabled people to share even more information in more elaborate ways and more conveniently to find that information so the honest answer is we tried to build a very general platform that could be adapted to a wide range of applications all right so let's do our next question question number two is the internet made of a copper wires b glass fiber c radio waves d satellites or e all of the above all right so half the audience has put in their poland their poll results uh we got about 75 voting all right if we could display the poll answers on screen uh so 75 percent said all of the above with the uh the rest of folks saying it's radio waves and satellites so vince what is the internet made of well it's not only is it made of all those communication media that you mentioned uh it's also made of free space lasers among other things but it's also a layered architecture and so in addition to the basic transport mechanisms uh the ones that you listed uh there are computers that have to be part of the network we call them routers and they are the things that move internet packets around and then on top of that are the computers that have all the applications running in them so the internet is made up of a hierarchy of uh of systems that uh perform all of its various functions in a layered fashion so there's a lot that goes into the internet and in the end it ends up in your house because many of us right this moment are at home using our laptops connected to radio based wifi which is connected probably the optical fiber into the backbone of the internet so it's made up of a whole lot of things in a hierarchy right but the physical layer is a mix of all those things we said and the internet protocol is what enables communication across all those things to work the same way whether it's light being traveled as on and off or ones and zeros or whether it's electricity on or off let's go to the next question so question number three what is the difference between the internet and the original phone system option a the phone system is for phone calls and the internet is for web pages option b the phone system connects phones together and the internet connects computers and option c the phone system uses direct persontoperson communications but on the internet everybody's information mixes together in packets all in the same connection this one seems a little bit harder for folks about half of everybody's students that have voted all right we're at 75 having answered all right let's share the results so almost 80 percent said option c that the inter the phone system uses direct connections the internet uses packets all on the same connection all right vince so so actually the third answer is probably the closest uh to accurate uh in the telephone system we use another expression that's called circuit switching which means we connect connections between each endpoint each telephone and we dedicate that circuit to that one phone call and only used by those two parties whereas uh in the internet the packets uh share the common communications traffic communications capacity so it's like the difference between dedicating a railroad track from los angeles to new york for one train versus having a highway or a freeway with dozens or hundreds of thousands of cars all sharing the common highway uh and moving wherever they need to go getting on and off as they have to which is what internet packets do there's another analogy that might be useful for some of your listeners to think about if you know anything about postcards then you know a lot about how the internet works because the postcard has a to address and a from address just like we experimented with just a few minutes ago to figure out how to send messages to each other and then it has a certain amount of content so the postcard is very much like an internet package it doesn't know how it's being carried the postcards don't know whether they went on a bicycle or a car or an airplane or a boat and the postcard also doesn't have any idea what you wrote on it and that's also true of internet packets they don't care how they were carried and they have no idea what you wrote on it the reason that's important is that we don't have to change the internet when we invent new applications because the applications are at the edges of the network in the computers like the ones that you and i are using right now they interpret the content of the packets as video or audio or email or a piece of a web page the network doesn't know and it doesn't care and the reason that's important is that if somebody invents a new application we don't have to change the network it just keeps moving packets around and so it's been a stable uh element of the internet's architecture for the last 45 years or so that it hasn't had to change very much except to grow in capacity but the basic protocol architecture has been stable it boggles my mind to think that for every second that you're talking that one second of video is transited into ones and zeros each of them put on a digital postcard split up into millions and millions of individual packets that are then sent on what is effectively like a highway system and those packets they don't come on a direct line to me they go each their individual different ways through different routers they come to my computer and then they're put back in order and then recreated back into the video literally billions of times a second and it's an architecture that was invented 45 years ago it's crazy um let's go to our last question who is in charge of the internet option a nobody option b the phone and cable companies option c google and facebook and these big websites and option d the government that'll be interesting yeah it'll be interesting to see what people think about this one so about 67 percent of voted 75 voted all right let's share the results all right so 60 say nobody's in charge almost 30 says the government is in charge and 15 say it's the phone companies or google and facebook so who's in charge well the real answer is we all are and we have but we don't have charge of everything we have charge of portions of network so the cable companies and the telephone companies have charge of some of the underlying physical networks that we run the packets on top of but companies like google and facebook and others have charge of their data centers uh and all of the computers that are part of that and the applications that they offer to the public you and i are in charge of our own networks at home uh where we have wifi we have dedicated connections into the public internet uh the government has something to say about this there are other organizations uh they may have regulations for example about the way in which the internet is used and what to do about people who abuse the internet and cause harm by means of abusing it uh there are one very special organization however called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers otherwise known as icam its responsibility is to make sure the domain names like www.google and internet addresses which we just talked about a few minutes ago get assigned uniquely to the parties who need them so you don't want to have the same address assigned to two different people you don't want to have a domain name assigned to two different organs the same domain name assigned to two different organizations so there's uniqueness which is assured by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers that's really the only centralized responsibility which is to assure uniqueness of those protocols and their parameters identifiers so so that's really the only place where there's any centralization everything else is fully distributed thanks so much um so for for anybody who's listened to this and has more questions about how does it actually work like how does a picture travel from my phone to my friend's phone or when i type in google into a web browser what happens how does it work we have a video series at code.org and we're going to email that to folks at the end of this episode and the video series includes vince and a whole bunch of other people who basically helped create the internet and we're going to send that to you all at the end of the episode um this is it for our quiz show vince but we have a question from the audience uh from rosemary candles in louisville kentucky is rose unmuted oh actually akira is going to introduce this question akira if we could introduce akira who's helps as producing code.org codebreak hi kira um yes so rose submitted this question on our questions forum but also on twitter and she said you gave such a powerful speech and you said that the internet is for everyone so how do you think we're doing specifically in america but if you have other cultural contexts applied to please do how do you think we're doing in america to make it accessible for everyone so what a great question it's hard to answer briefly but let me say first of all that we think about half of the world's population has some access to the internet sometimes it's just through the mobile phones which are getting better and faster over time sometimes it's through dedicated circuits fiber connections or coaxial cable but that's only about half the world's population so and by the way this is not country even in countries that are heavily invested in internet there are places that do not have access in the us for example our rural parts of the country are very rarely have very good quality internet access at all this is also true in other parts of the world as i'm sure you must know there are barriers to providing access to the internet some of them is physical facilities which we need to build out uh and that may get um let's i won't say fixed but a new avenue for connectivity is coming spacex a company run by elon musk is planning to launch satellites in orbit thousands of them so that the entire surface of the earth will be able to get access to the internet assuming the system works so that's one step in the direction of making sure people could get some access the second issue of course is cost how much does it cost to get onto the net how much does the equipment cost and how much does the service cost and driving cost out is very important in order to make the internet affordable and reliably accessible to people so they can take advantage of it and so there are no then there may be regulatory issues associated with who is allowed to offer internet service do you have to get a license or not is it a regulated service uh is there competition permitted or not and so those things also have to be taken into account and then there is a much more general question of internet governance which we don't have time to get into but you can just imagine with the system as pervasive as the internet has become and as powerful as the internet has become there are a lot of arguments over who should be in charge and what the rules of the use should be so there are lots of things that get in the way of providing internet access to everyone i'm committed to trying to get the rest of the world up on the internet if they want to be in a way that's affordable and reliable safe and secure thank you so much vince uh i had one last question i wanted to ask but really briefly because we're short on time uh you know you're known as the father of the internet but you aren't the only person who was involved can you give us for all the young women in the audience names of two or three folks who you'd think of as the mothers of the internet that they can then google uh to get inspiration about the the people who helped create this this resource that all of us around the world use well first of all that you showed a brief picture early on an introduction of my colleague robert khan and he and i did the original internet design way back in 1973 but it was based on top of work that was done in a predecessor network called the arpanet so that project was run for the american defense department by larry roberts the network working group that did the original uh arpanet protocols the ones that you were demonstrating for internet was done by stephen crocker who happens to be my best friend in high school and still my best friend uh 60 years later david clark john postel there are a just endless number of people who have contributed to the internet and continue to contribute today so the big message for the students out there is to realize that the internet is still ready to accept new ideas it's ready to adapt and evolve and you have the opportunity to invent new applications as long as you can figure out how to program them which is what code.org is all about and so software is an endless frontier the internet is a place where you can invent to your heart's content and perhaps create applications that the rest of the world can take advantage of so just go out there and do that well thank you so much vince uh let's switch to gallery view and give the audience a chance to say goodbye to vince and sophie is going to play you some applause thank you so much everybody goodbye well we learned basically about how the internet is how computing devices communicate whether it's from a laptop or a phone or a giant data center or an automobile even a watch all these devices communicate over the internet whether it's to send data text messages video chats snapchats tick tock really any sort of information but one of the most popular things the internet is used for is for browsing web pages so when you use google's chrome or microsoft's edge or internet explorer or safari on apple devices you're browsing web pages and this is what we're going to learn about next in the last segment of our episode which is about web pages all right uh are you ready sophia yes all right so for our final segment what we're going to do is we're going to go into code.org and use something called weblab a tool that helps us make simple websites uh and i'm going to screen share web lab right now and show it to you so here we are and uh this is inside code.org and basically we have two files here an html file and a css file and we're going to add these sofia is going to help me build a website about her cats so i'm gonna go first edit the html and html is the language that is sent instead of the ones and zeros we sent for sending images web pages on the internet are sent in html and you don't need to memorize how i do this right now we're gonna send you an email at the end of this uh to help you make your own so sophia what do you want me to put inside my web page um first let's have a title okay we're gonna put a title so that uses a header tag and the way you do headers is you put this little angle bracket and then an h1 and then a close of an angle angle bracket and that means it's a title or a header what do you want to say my cat sunshine my cat sunshine and now you have to close each tag to say that it's the end of the title which is an angle bracket and a slash and an h1 and by this language was invented by a guy named tim bernerslee who invented the world wide web and here we have our title my cat sunshine in our webpage uh what else would you like to put in there um let's put a photo of sunshine right the photo is done with an image tag which is an angle bracket img and instead of text we're gonna put the information about where the photo is so i'm going to say the source of the photo equals and i already uploaded a photo of sunny by clicking the add image button up here so it knows about sunny which is your cat's name and i'm going to say let's make it the width of the entire web page 100. so there's sunny my cat's sunshine and you know this width hundred goes from here to here but if i expand to see the whole web page it makes it a hundred percent of the page no matter what so i'm going to make this a little bit smaller to make it 50 percent of the web page so it goes half half width on the web page and is there anything else you want to put in there let's add a paragraph about function all right we're going to add some text so we're going to use the paragraph tag which is just a p and what what do you want to put in our paragraph um this is my cat sunshine he is an orange polydactyl cat which means he has seven toes on the front pause instead of four oh you speak really fast all right i think i got that all uh but it the text hasn't showed up yet because i need to close my paragraph again with this close tag and as soon as i close it it shows up and now here's our very simple web page that we just made and when you see any web page on the internet like on google on facebook amazon microsoft anywhere it's being sent in this language called html but if you look here this doesn't look like most web pages because the font and text are just really simple we can add styles to to to make them more interesting so what what do you want to do to make them more interesting um let's change the title color you want to change the color all right let's change the color of the header so let's make another color let's make it a dark orange dark orange it's a dark orange and look the title is a different color do you want to change any of the fonts as well yes let's change it to um i'm going to change the font family what do you want the font all right my cat sunshine that already looks a little prettier do you want to change the phone to the paragraph text as well make it cursive we can change this and i have to put these semicolons to end these so here now it says this is my cat sunshine and again if you look at the whole web page these styles carry through and what's interesting about styles we didn't style the individual piece of text we said just change the style for headers or let's change the style for paragraphs so if i go back to my html page and if i add another header so let me say another header this is another header again i need to close this header tag you see it shows up in the orange applied to both of them and if i go back to the style sheet and i change this from orange to blue it changes all the headers all at the same time and that's why they call it a style sheet because you're not changing just the individual text i don't know why that didn't work i don't think you spelled it correctly either way so this is how web pages work and you can see the html here and the style sheet and the actual content on the right and anybody can use code.org to make these simple html pages and then to see the end result of how it works what we're going to do is we're actually going to send this out to you so that any of you can create your own and in fact if you're watching right now please make sure we have you on our mailing list for code break so if you haven't signed up already go to code.org break and enter your email address where it says to sign up if you do that then at the end of this episode we're going to email you a really fun set of activities that's going to include first of all the video series that you can watch about how the internet works that video series works even on a smartphone for students who don't have computers then you can learn if you're an older student you can learn how web lab works and to create your own html and then for the challenge we have two challenges one for younger students is to come up with a communication protocol to share information between your parents or with a brother and sister using a flashlight just like sophia did and if you're more advanced to build a simple website and when you're done creating stuff not only share it with your parents but if they have social media ask them to share it on social media with the hashtag codebreak and as we always do we're going to pick the best things that people share and invite them back on the show next week to join us with next week's special guest and speaking of for next week i'm excited to announce our special guest next week is going to be sal khan the founder of khan academy which is like code one of the most popular ways students learn online khan academy isn't about coding in computer science it's about math and science and all sorts of subjects social studies and all sorts of subjects that are taught in schools we're so excited to have sal khan join us next week and then finally if you're a parent who's been enjoying each week please consider supporting code.org by visiting code.org help we would love all the support we can get before we close off let's switch to gallery view again and have all the students on camera get a chance to wave goodbye and if we could unmute them and everybody say goodbye you're studying alone take a code break we'll see you again next week goodbye you
