and pull up welcome everyone to your ecs monthly meeting for october we're really glad that you've been able to join us this evening for the next 45 minutes to an hour we're going to be working together to chat about the exploring computer science curriculum and the code.org program my name is melissa jones i'm a community manager here at code.org and this evening i'm joined by danny mcavoy who's our ecs program manager brooke osborne high school program manager and our special guest eric snow who's a researcher from sri international our goals with these calls as always are to connect as a community and to discuss how the school year is going with your ecs implementation tonight we're really excited to get a tour of the new unit assessment from eric and to get an overview of the phase 3pd from danny and of course at the end of the call there'll be plenty of time for you to share questions concerns and feedback for the group this month we're using blue jeans for our platform um so last month if you joined us we used google hangouts it's slightly different blue jeans is fun and pretty easy to use there's a chat window that's located sort of right above your picture if you or have your video on um and if you click on that you can type in any questions you have for the speaker feedback ideas say hello and introduce yourself it's an easy way to communicate with the moderators and then also you should have a little microphone and a little um video camera icon underneath your picture and you can toggle those on and off if you'd like to speak or share your video stream with others next i'm going to go ahead and introduce danny mcavoy who's going to share some important reminders for them all ready hi everybody uh so can you flip to the next slide where our important reminders are great thank you melissa um so for this month we have a couple important reminders first of all i'm sure many of you have heard that the sri unit assessment for unit 1 is now available and the link is right there and for you to look at if you you can't click on the link in the slides but if you want to check that out we'll have a link to a forum post at the end where you can find all of our resources that we've used throughout this talk so you'll be able to check those out download them there's a scoring guide as well and eric will have a chance to talk about that in a little bit the unit 2 assessment will release november 1st so that'll be before our next time we join together on a monthly call so just as a heads up november 1st that will show up for you as well phase 3 online is now available you should have received an email um with the link and everything you need for phase online if you haven't received that link or if you're missing information about it you want to email pdfcode.org or you can set put something in the chat window and we'll try and help you out uh last thing is just reminders um as always we'd love for you to add resources to the resource folder uh if you weren't able to make it to our um talk for last month we went over what the resource folder is and how to use it so we can we'll post a link to that video as well in case you want to check it out and see what the resource folder is and lastly always the forum is a great place to ask questions get help talk to other teachers find resources there's been some really great stuff that's been posted lately and some really great sharing so we'd love to see you guys keep that up it's really great to have such an awesome community to work with granny before you introduce her i'm just going to go ahead and switch over if you want to share your screen that way i can manage the chat pod that sounds good all righty i'm going to stop sharing and dania can start i'm going to go on mute as well anybody else um who's dialing in you may want to go on mute just to reduce background noise and i see eric has joined us as well so eric we're really glad to have you we're going to start your presentation in just one second great happy to be here thank you all righty um all good everybody can see that okay all right so we're really lucky tonight to have eric with us he's going to talk about the sri assessments uh all the work they've been doing to create these wonderful tests to go along with the um ecs curriculum that you guys already have received we have heard a lot of feedback from teachers that they really want some way to do assessment that schools are really asking for that so it's great to have these resources coming out this year as you're teaching the curriculum and eric's going to overview the unit 1 just part of the unit 1 assessment for you and answer questions that you may have about the assessment so i'm going to pass it off to eric great um thank you so should i go ahead and ah you've answered my question slides are right there um can i should i just tell you next screen when i'm ready yep okay great um so thank you very much for and you can all see me is that correct yep okay great uh a little informal tonight i hope that's uh okay i just ended my day um happy to be here really excited to talk to you about the assessments uh you've been waiting quite a long time for them uh for those of you who have been doing ecs for more than one year and those of you who are starting this year it's a good year to start because we are happy to have released kind of the first validated version of the assessments uh for use by teachers and i emphasized that last part because that's really who we created the assessments for we know that there are a lot of other uses and folks that want to use the assessments for other things but um you know from the outset i want to emphasize that we want we did this project to support the teachers using the curriculum and to support the spread of the curriculum and so we're really excited to have this opportunity to talk with code.org teachers who are implementing ecs if you want to go to the next one and just to tell you a little bit about myself as well as as a way of introduction i work at the center for technology and learning at si international in the education division we focus on uh tech you know as the name of the center implies uh technology and education projects both in evaluation and assessment and in different curricular areas science computer science as one of our more recent areas of focus i do a lot of work in assessment development and particularly in assessment validation that's my specialization um i also do evaluation and i'm working on a number of different evaluations uh around computational thinking and game design right now that is nice because it's in the after school environment so that gives me a kind of a spread of uh stuff from both uh in school uh classroom types of environments to after school in the computer science space but as uh as mentioned we have been working on the ecs assessments for about two years now they've gone through two rounds of piloting um primarily in chicago schools but also in other in a few other schools throughout the country as well and we've gone through two rounds of validation for various reasons because really the first time out this was brand new we were dealing with a brand new area of measurement so we really wanted to kind of figure out how to do this right and then the second time around was really about refining the assessment tasks and making sure that we felt comfortable uh with you know releasing them this year because we really knew there was a need to do so so we have we we we are releasing the assessments through the cs10k community of practice website uh most of you i think already know about this website um and it's released as a resource in the ecs open group which means that you have to have a cs10k account and be logged into the website in order to see the available resources one of which is the assessments um excuse me are the assessments and the links are are shown there on the slide um we have a particular schedule for really uh that we're kind of trying to release them on that follows the recommended kind of sequencing and timing of the curriculum if you could proceed to the next slide that'd be great thank you um we've already released unit one um october first and then we're doing pretty much a monthly uh release with some time extra time around the holidays um we do understand that folks are there's different flavors of ecs if you will and we know that some folks are going to be implementing on different schedules and so if that's the case if you are after these dates the assessments are going to remain open for download so that's not a problem but if it's before these dates and you have a special request please go ahead and contact us at that email address and we'll be happy to accommodate you and talk with you about your implementation schedule and how we can make sure you have the assessments you need if you want to proceed to the next slide um so i really wanted to i could say a lot more about her development process and so on and so forth and was going to until uh melissa and danny and others um kindly prompted me to focus in on one of the tasks and some of the scoring for unit one which i think will probably be more relevant to all of you at this point um so before i do that i actually wanted to take a minute to stop and see if there are any questions before i kind of dive into this example if anybody has any questions or has anything they would like to discuss i have no questions so far in the chat pod but if there is anybody that would like to turn their mic on and ask a question or put a question in the chat pod we can make sure it gets answered okay great well i i you know you never know quite how long to wait um i don't i know you have some other uh items on your agenda so i don't want to delay anyone uh this evening um but i did want to dive into an example of a unit one task and particularly focus on the scoring aspects because i think that that is going to be probably one of the more challenging aspects of this for it from the teacher perspective right out the gate and we want to be able to provide what support we can i will say that beyond this presentation to you which is preliminary nature we will be running a series of webinars um come winter and spring around um both scoring and i think more significantly around score interpretation and test use because we really do want to provide support and those will be run through the cs10k community of practice website and particularly maybe i'll be able to come back and talk to you all if uh if things work out well and and uh it fits your schedule so for unit one um task two we have entitled what is computing and what we're really taught and what i want to do here is i want to walk through kind of what we're trying to target with this task and then show you what the task looks like which i think many of you have already seen and then tell you kind of what our rationale is for how we score it um so in terms of the core concepts and learning goals which is in the left most column there um you see that we're trying to target you know the concepts of computers and computing computing versus noncomputing tasks and this idea of computer or tele intelligence as it's represented in ecs um and i think in particular we're looking for students to be able to explain the differences between tasks that can and cannot be accomplished with computer um in order to kind of take this down to the assessment level what we're really targeting is a student's ability to explain not significant because we're really targeting their ability to engage in explanation and explain the differences between tasks that can and cannot be accomplished with the computer and um you know so we have this task what is computing students are provided with the scenario and asked to relate it to the types of tasks a robot which in this case represents a computer there are other representations certainly of what a robot can do so if you want to proceed to the next slide so this comes from the actual assessment task in unit one um again it's task two and in this task it's um carla has programmed the robot to select some clothes um and then your the students told what the robot is able to do move around the room open and close doors and pick up and drop objects very simple behaviors um then they were provided with a set of instructions for the robot once the robot is inside the closet to select the clothes there's three sets of instructions they're worded in particular ways and then if you want to go to the next slide in this slide we start to see you know the students engaging with the task after the context of the scenario is laid out their first step is for them to select or identify one step in the three steps that we provided in the task setup that the robot would have difficulty completing we provide those tasks again those those steps again and they're supposed to select one we're not scoring the selection that's not the objective of the task what we really care about is the student's ability to engage in explanation providing rationale for their selection and so first we want to know in part a why the robot would have difficulty completing that task and so this explanation is worth one point student either kind of gets it or doesn't and this is based on a couple iterations of seeing how students respond to this task um keep that in mind this isn't just our best guess this actually comes from um several hundred responses to this and seeing that these are the kinds of things that students do and before we had several points for this explanation and now we really broke it down to just one and really what we want to see is that they should discuss difficulties a robot would have with the steps selected because it would it would eat the step is either not precise for example take out a tshirt isn't very precise it's very vague um or it's too subjective which take out a hat from the top shelf that matches the outfit might be too subjective so in that case you could get a point for an explanation that went along one of those two lines there might be some other explanations that would make sense as well and that's one of the things is as this assessment evolves and we get more and more responses we'll be the rubric is going to evolve as well so the more types of responses that we see to this the more we're going to be able to refine um this but this is consistent this this way of evaluating the explanation is consistent with both what we're seeing in the the pilots and also in the curriculum if you want to go to the next slide so for part b again what we want here is the student to rewrite the step that they chose in part a so they've selected a step they're not scored they explain why the robot would have a hard time with that step and then what we want to do is based on that we write the steps so it's easier for a robot to complete and this is also worth one point and what we want to see here is that the rewritten step is more precise in the language that's used in some way or less subjective than the steps selected for part a now we do recognize that there's a lot of variability one could see here the types of responses students give that could be considered precise or less objective excuse me so what we've tried to do is provide you with example responses that really show each score level very very clearly and help you distinguish between the different scoring levels so if you could go to the next slide um this will be really important in the rubrics we have a couple different parts of the rubrics if you've seen you know they're available for download and if you've seen them we have a quick scoring guide and then we have the detailed scoring guide and then within the detailed scoring guide we have sample responses and this is a sample response for two points where our students select to take out a tshirt they explain that a robot would have difficulty completing the step because the instructions don't say the exact type of shirt you have many types of shirts in the closet they come in different color styles and sizes the student clearly gets the idea from this and for part b and they rewrite the step to be more precise take out the first tshirt from the right hanger hanging from the right hanging on hanger the language throughout has never been quite precise but the idea is there that they they did um provide a more precise explanation and then we provide a rationale for why they get those points um and so i just want to point this out because i think this will be really valuable as teachers uh start to use the rubrics and learn what works and what doesn't um in terms of scoring needs and so if you go to the next slide i think that's it for me and happy to answer any questions or uh you know hear any comments folks have about the assessments or the rubrics so eric we did have two questions come up in the chat pod the first one um folks were having trouble accessing the link to the assessments on the cs10k site that they should be in contact with cs10k about or are you able to give us a different link um no you know i i i would probably go ahead and contact us and so again i just want to emphasize that if they are logged in like they have an account on cs10k and that account has been validated um i believe the ecs open group is open i don't think they have to request membership do they i'm not i don't believe they do yeah yeah but that's a validated account yeah and then and then it's under the resources however um if folks are having you know if if they've signed up for an account recently like in the next last couple days it may be that their account may not be validated but if they've been using it for a while and they just don't see that resource yet then that's another issue yeah and we'd love to hear from them individually and we can go ahead and help them get to those assessments okay what link do you have just uh just to be visited you had in your slide it was resource slash ecs assessments yes and that that is the the link we've been distributing to folks and what that again the hang up we've been experiencing is that folks may not have their account or account validated yet right um and they can't see the resources until they do yeah and it does seem like a couple folks in the chat pod said they did not have an issue so it might just be something with the individual's account but if you are having any trouble accessing the assessments or the ecs open group um it would definitely be a good idea to shoot an email over to eric's group packed underscore ecs great um oh sure did someone else want to chime in go right ahead i saw someone start to speak so we had one more question i'm not sure whether you can answer this one but one of our members was wondering whether you had any additional um suggestions for daily warmup activities or exit tickets that would help with this um assessment work you know that's a really interesting question and um i at this point no but one of the things we want to engage ecs teachers in this year through the community of practice website is i for lack of a better term leaning on the ecs teachers expertise and experiences in the classroom and the community um to develop some more formative type tasks that are connected in with these end of unit tasks because what we really want to do ultimately is have this idea of a through course assessment where we have things like exit you know exit slips or the mastery slips or there's different versions of these things but they're all formative in nature to be able to help students and teachers work together along the way before they get to that end of the unit class that end of unit assessment and so we don't have those right now but we are we're working on plans right now to engage the community in helping us develop some of those things and really leaning on the the expertise and experience of the teachers and we have these we have these larger scenariobased tasks but underlying those are design templates that we developed first and from those we can work with teachers to parse out the you know the different things that we're targeting these bigger tasks into things that would be more appropriate for you know smaller exit type mastery flips or whatnot and another thing i want to add is that this year we're we have ongoing studies where we are we're in the process of piloting some new tasks and both the type you see in the current assessments and on multiple choice tasks because one of the things we want to be able to do is provide teachers with support on conceptual knowledge of their students because the tasks we have right now assume that the student has the conceptual knowledge and we're looking for them to apply it in many cases it may not be that the student has a good grasp on that underlying conceptual knowledge and multiple choice conceptual knowledge type tasks can help get at that and so from those we can build out formative measures as well so there's a lot of different opportunities here to get at some finer grained measurement of of conceptual knowledge and more formative measures from that as well great thank you eric um so we have just a quick update um brooke tells us if you're having issues with accessing the assessments make sure you're logged into cs10k and that you're a member of the ecs open group and folks if you're still having trouble after that please definitely do send an email to eric um danny did you have any other followup questions for eric i'll hand it back to you um no so eric the you guys did a webinar of overviewing all of the unit assessments right up through four that's correct so if people want to find that is there a place they can go to get those will be yeah we'll have those posted on the cs10k site and on the pax site in the coming weeks awesome so if you want an overview of like eric did of one of the questions from each of unit 2 unit three and unit four you can take a look at those um in that video that will get posted and i'm just wanna reiterate i'm happy to come back and and talk with your teachers whenever you have time in your schedule as we uh move throughout the year if there's you know questions and other things that come up i we really do want to support the whole community of ecs teachers and particularly those uh working through code.org um it's such an important initiative so uh do let us know how we can help and if we can fit it in we will do so awesome well thank you very much for joining us well thank you for the comment and if you guys have any questions that pop up in your head we can always address them or send an email to eric later on so we're going to keep heading forward thank you again eric for all that information it was really helpful we're we're going to head into our phase 3 online overview so as i mentioned at the beginning of the webinar we have released phase 3 online it's going to look a little different than your phase 2 online it's still in code studio and it still has a bunch of levels but we're actually going to break phrase 3 into units so you're going to see that this phase 3 online is only unit 2. we will be releasing unit 3 unit 4 at the beginning of next month and then 5 and 6 will come out later in the year so what does phase 3 online look like and how is it different than phase 2 online so the major thing is that we're going to be doing a challenge and a challenge is just our fancy word for a um planning of a lesson and sharing it with the community so you're going to either work individually or with a partner to take a look at one particular lesson and prepare to teach it and then create some resources just to share with the teaching community so that you can share your lesson and someone else shares a different lesson we all get to learn from each other all right so why complete these challenges it's really important to complete them because it'll help you when you're heading into teaching right these are the lessons you're going to teach and we're just giving you an opportunity to teach that lesson ahead of time right try it out see what happens uh test the activity think about what extra resources you might want to add so by doing this you'll get just get a chance to prepare a lesson you'll receive feedback from other teachers in the community so we're gonna you'll be posting what you create to the forum and by posting it you get you'll hopefully get some feedback from other teachers you'll get feedback from us at code.org as to if your work meets the criteria we ask for and then you'll also hopefully learn from the other resources that will be posted as well um so how do you complete this challenge there's a couple steps and i've tried to shrink this slide down i know i hate slides with so much text but i really wanted to get in as much as possible while still shrinking it down so we're gonna go through it all right so what you're gonna be doing you're gonna prepare for a lesson this is step one and what you'll do is we'll give you a list of lessons that are ones that are usually really challenging for teachers and you'll pick one of those lessons you'll share that choice on the forum and that's also the place you can ask to see if you can find a friend that wants to work with you this friend does not need to be sitting in the same location as you these wonderful hangouts can be done one person to another on google hangouts and you can talk and chat or you can go over the phone if you like that better whatever works for you you can find a partner or work individually but you're still going to share your choice so people know who's working on what then you'll go through the lesson and try out the activities you don't need to try it out on your students you're just trying it out yourself or if you need like a friend to help you out maybe you like rope your spouse into it or some of your friends over for a party one night and you decide that you're gonna make them do ecs whatever you need to do to test out the lesson and then you're gonna create samples of the types of work that students will create just so that when you share it other teachers can see all right so this is what someone's results of this work should look like you'll reflect on the experience we have a reflection sheet it's not you're not going to hand it in it's just more for you to think back what did i go through what do i need to prepare what else could i add to this and then you'll create a plan from that your plan will just overview those reflections what did you think what did you need to add you'll create resources or find resources to add to the lesson if you think that's necessary you can create a video so we have some awesome examples from the csp curriculum of teaching tips videos that you can try out you can just create a video that you sit in front of your computer explaining what you found from what going through the lesson and what you'd suggest other teachers or you can create a video that overviews how to do something so when we get into a programming unit you could overview how to do a certain programming concept any of that stuff is fine any resources you might add even if it's a slide deck that would be awesome too so you'll create that and then you'll make a onepage summary of this so we have an overview template this is kind of like a cover sheet that you would hand in it overviews everything that you have learned from this you'll put links to your resources and this will be your way to easily share with each other what you've learned about your lesson and then there's a rubric just for you to selfassess it's the same rubric that we'll be using to check for completion of the challenge so you can just go through that and check that yourself so you know when you hand it in you're good to go and then lastly at the end you're going to share it so you're going to share your work to the forum and more detailed uh overview of how to do this is given on your online pd so don't worry about it this is there are lots of little breakdowns of these steps in that so you will know more details then um you'll find the thread that matches the lesson you worked on and you'll p post your work there because that way when you are going through the forum and you're trying to find out how do i teach this lesson you just go straight to that lesson and you'll be able to see oh look there's all this work that other teachers did and i can learn from their experiences and then lastly in order to get credit for it and to get it submitted to us you'll have to post a link to your forum post in your online pd but don't worry you'll be have directions to do that and it won't be too difficult so don't worry too much all right so how do you submit all this um and when do you need to submit it so you'll submit it onto the forum and then you'll copy and paste the link you need to do this by um your phase four which is this summer so you got lots of time we're really not looking for you to sit down and go through level by level and check the green marks um along the way we're looking for you to be able to prep as it fits your schedule so if you're going to do unit 4 before unit 3 for some reason maybe you're running a semester class and you do units one two and four do the unit four pd before unit three pd that makes more sense for you that is why unit three and unit four are getting released together at the same time they'll get released november beginning of november so if that's what you need do that you can always come back and do the other ones later in the year but do the ones you need to prep for the work that you're going to be doing in your classroom we really want this to help improve your classroom experience so we have suggested completion dates oh i'm clicking too fast obviously we have suggested completion dates but those are just recommend recommendations you just need to have it done by the end of the school year all of them done by the end of the school year all right um i'm now going to stop talking and see if there are any questions about the phase three online so danny we did have one question in the chat pod which i answered but i thought it might be good to talk about it on the video so it's in the recording um someone asked if this um challenge assignment and online pd is just for teachers who are part of our district partnership ecs program um and the answer i gave so correct me if i'm wrong um is that anyone can go to forum.co.org c slash ecs and see the challenges and submit but it's not required unless you're part of the program is that correct yeah we'd love to have teachers that are outside of the program do the work and share their resources so this is another great time to talk about the resource folder one of the best things about being part of a cohort of teachers is that you get to work with each other and hopefully learn from each other we've seen a lot of this with the forum already with people posting like hey here's a kahoot that i made for um my class maybe some other teachers will like it and we actually had a teacher that posted back and said they used it and they loved it it worked great for their kids so if you have a resource that you created maybe you have a slide deck we have another teacher that shared all of her slide decks she created so if you have those resources we want to see those and we want you to share them um because it it is helpful and it does make your lives easier because maybe two of you are creating slide decks and you can share the responsibility and only create it every other day if you want to work with another teacher so these groups of teachers help make everybody better so if you're outside of the coho cohort you're not an official code.org teacher but you want to add to the resources go for it and use and take from what the code.org teachers create i think that's one of the benefits of doing this and also just to clarify between um uh eric was speaking about the cs 10k community for ecs that's a great place to go to interact with ecs teachers from all across the country the code.org forums forum.co.org that's where we have our specific program related conversations but are also a great resource so feel free to use both communities or whatever works best for you and if you do have something awesome i would suggest sharing it in both places so that not only code.org teachers can benefit but all ecs teachers um so danny there's one other question david asks should should we be able to see phase three online in codestudio today i can actually take that this is brooke i am sitting across from the person who is releasing it even as we speak um so that should be available in your teacher dashboard in minutes basically and you'll you'll get an email when that happens as well but it will be available today and just to reiterate what danny said there's going to be three parts um well more actually but the unit two part is what's going to be available to you later today and there'll be a unit 2 challenge so as you're working through the online pd there will be a couple of stages that are just sort of an introduction and tell you about the pd and the challenge and then there'll be some stages that you can work through on your own about the different lessons and it finishes up with the challenge and you'll have the same exact workflow for unit 3 4 5 and 6. so if there are any other questions now about ecs or the code.org program please feel free to put them in the chat pod and we'll take them before we close out tonight okay ladies well it looks like we don't have any other questions at this time danny did you have any parting words would you like me to close out uh well i think you want to talk about the meeting for next month and that we'll continue to do these yeah sure to make sure everyone is aware that we will be having these ecs meetings once a month um we'll be hoping to have guest speakers and reminders um just like we had um today as well as important announcements about the programs and um and just to reiterate this this call is a great resource for folks who are in the current cohort of code.org ucs teachers but like luanne um it's open to alumni and veterans as well and any interested parties um so the next call is going to be november 3rd same time and we'll probably use the same blue jeans place for it and then it's going to go the last slide there danny just a reminder that we would love to hear your feedback tonight so if you go to this forum thread you can tell us what you thought of tonight's meeting and that's also where we'll put a link to the slide deck and the recording once it's processed so thanks so much for being a participant tonight and we look forward to seeing you in november take care
