hello hi everyone I think my life now I sorry for the delay before so hi I'm Alice I'm president of code org I'm Tonya and I'm a product manager I'm Jake Novoa Marketing Coordinator here at work great so today we're going to walk through a few slides and finally sniffing those up right now going over what to expect for our code what's changed this year versus previous years and how you can be prepared if at any point your mistakes and questions for the end if at any point during this conversation you have questions the chat window is open throughout the conversation and we're going to answer those questions also as they come in so if you have any questions just ask them as you're going along so this is Alice he just met us so this is us again our agenda today we're gonna walk through quickly an update on what we're doing this year of our code and we're going to talk about the overview of volunteer in a classroom program shares from the feedback from teachers and students last year's teacher students and you guys volunteers and then we'll go through the volunteer toolkit and how you can be ready for the classroom so first of all for those of you who haven't done our code in the past one quickly introduced what this is all about the hour of code was designed to really break stereotypes around what computer science is I can tell you till I'm blue in the face the computer size is fun and interesting you're gonna like it it is totally different to actually get to try one hour yourself to get to build something and make something that you can be proud of and by making that an accessible experience where students can adjust one hour actually make their own game or have it really it makes them feel like they can do it it's been amazingly successful we see that most students who try it want to go beyond an hour which is actually the goal is that our goal is you know let's hook up with you know hey I can do this I can do it as a student and I can do it as a teacher we see especially a big increase in high school females where they're you know 20 points more likely how to survey to say that they are interested in studying computer science after doing an hour of code so really it really makes a big difference and I think because it makes a big difference because it's successful and it's an introductory way to try computer science we've seen it just take off around the world we started five years ago and at this point we've had over 100 million students in every single country in the world so it's been amazing and doesn't large part to volunteers like you guys who are going to help new students at classroom to try and computer science so that retired before so what's new in 2017 first of all our focus this year is you know originally we've always been about more than an hour but originally it was really most of the class had never done this before and so we had a lot of teacher the students that were super nervous about you know the idea that they were going to teach computer science or something like a scary thing as VC schools doing this era over here we're breaking those stereotypes it's working yeah so now we want to see them go further an hour is not enough so when you're in the classroom your goal should not just be a duty hour of code but to encourage that school and that teacher to try teaching computer science we have tools available for everybody to do this so you don't need to be there as a volunteer to help them go teach computer science there are workshops that teachers can go to to help them we have tools for administrators to help them understand what it means to bring computer science to their school how they would add it to the course offerings how they would think about it we have tools for parents to help them you know advocate for computer science at their school the place to send people as you you know hopefully every classroom before you leave if you can send them to code org slash your school there's space there for them to find the resources there's also a survey there where you can write down what that school already teaches which is a key part of getting the school to teach more is understanding what does that school teach today so you know ask your teacher like do you guys teach you know does every kid at this school get computer science do just some kids get it is an elective did any kids get it surprisingly in the 21st century most schools today don't teach in any computer science at all in k12 so if you can help help fill this out with your schools that should bets a goal we also have made a bunch of updates the hour of code activity page and con you want to talk a little bit about what we're doing there so the Arkham activity page or our code comm slash learn is the catalog of all of the activities that we recommend for your students or the teachers that you're working with to track and so we are making some updates to make this more approachable and easier for new teachers and new students who are coming in to find the activities that are best suited for their age group their experience their interests we have over 200 tutorials of activities to offer so we definitely want to give them a way to search for what's best for them so we're making a couple of changes we are highlighting for example the age filter and the ability to see which tutorials are best suited for your age group and we're also giving it a some design update and make it even prettier and more engaging especially for high school students we often hear that they don't think that this is for them I think this is just for kids baby so we want to show them that it is for them it's actually for anyone even adults we want to make this page look more exciting engaging and let everyone know that anybody can learn we have some really advanced tutorials on there so it is definitely great for a computer science class as a way to celebrate us Education Week making something advanced maybe try a language and maybe they're learning JavaScript in class so they can do a 1hour Python tutorial to learn about Python or you know something like that but yeah all ages definitely all ages and all experience levels I know it can be able to whelming to have that many different options so we're going to make it easy for you we have a team of teachers 15 teachers who've gone through and played every single tutorial and they our staff ranked in order of what the teachers think are the best so you can look through as many as you want or if you just want to make it easy for yourselves pick your age group so like I'm doing 9 through 12th graders or I'm doing 6 through eighth grade and then the one in the very top is one that our teachers recommend so you can just go with that and not have to think about it um you can dig as much as you want they're a lot of fun but you can also just pick the one that's the one the teachers liked and stay tuned because of November we're gonna be adding even more tutorials for what they've been reviewed and submitted this year so we're gonna have some baby tutorial snaps later remember yeah we also have a remote volunteer list so yes and I just wanted to call out that the volunteers are different ways you can volunteer if you are near schools definitely try and go visit see those kids in person and meet the teachers of the students but we also encourage you to remotely volunteer so that means a teacher in a different state or even a different country can connect with you and you can just be honest that call or go hang out and speak to the students about your experience in tech and how you got to see us and what you think about the IRF code so that way we can even connect you with people outside of your area yeah go look at a hopefully you can get connected with teachers in Canada and Maui we can connect more teachers and volunteers across the area and this has been a real challenge too because our volunteers are not evenly distributed we have more volunteers and tech hub so if you're located in Silicon Valley or Seattle or another place with a lot of tech we have a lot of volunteers meanwhile in other places we have fewer volunteers but so being able to volunteer remotely helps with that and we'll talk a little bit more about this later but if you are in a tech hub you may not be contacted by a teacher but that doesn't mean you shouldn't reach out and we'll talk a little bit about that later so here's the overview of the timeline of the timeline sure so this is focused on the timeline for in preparation for the outcode what you want to do is make sure that you're ready to help the teachers early on because they need a lot of time to prepare before their hour of code a bit most of the our code events will be happening during computer science education week in December 4 to 10 but it varies some teachers their schedules are a little bit different they make it a little earlier they make it a little later so we want to try and give them extra time and have you connected and ready to go way before their hour of code of X so now is the time to sign up to volunteer if you have it yet please go visit code org slash volunteer and sign up so that teachers can see you and contact you and between October through November these teachers will be looking through the math finding volunteers in their area or maybe other areas for example if they want to get remote volunteers and they'll be contacting you we never share your email address with these teachers they are submitting a form echoes to us and you'll be receiving email from me with all of the teachers contact information so that you can choose to respond to them depending on what their request is I mean how you can pop up and then given that time between October November once you connect to the teacher and that's what you should coordinate maybe the things that they need for example a background check some schools univac rep check so if you provide that certain information or maybe sign a little bit of paperwork help them choose a tutorial guide them on what a text the text setup might be like each of the teachers needs can be a little bit different so wherever your strikes are try to be flexible to help teachers in that way and in up to 24 that's our session today but after that once you are sent and connected with the teacher we will talk about next what you can expect out of your actual our code event yeah and you know um Tonya made it sound a little intimidating to get ready it's not that hard but you do need to be the best because even like the schools where you just go in and do it and there's not really any prep work these that but you still usually need to do a background check which means you'll need to fill out a little paperwork at the school and it takes a couple days for the skin each teacher is going to tell you what they need and if they don't need any great yeah also as a reminder after the our code will be sending a quick survey out to you to hear about your experience we'd love to know at what well and how it went and we need that information to continue improving here so feedback from last year we had thousands of volunteers promise if you're on the call who volunteered in classrooms 90% told us of it fill out their survey and told us they were satisfied or extremely satisfied and the other 10% we're working on trying to change things that didn't go as well as they could and what I thought was even more exciting was that 98% of the students and teachers thought they had a good or great experience and most of them went on to to go beyond an hour so most of them were inspired and actually they didn't stop an hour which is awesome actually this is my favorite set 18% of the teachers told us that they went on to teach in computer science course after doing the hour of code so that's not just a one hour change in that classroom that's a meaningful lasting impact over time so if you can try to get to be one of the volunteers who has your teacher join that eighteen percent that's the real goal so what if past volunteers told us you guys can read that I want to read them aloud to you um but you know they've told us that it's really exciting as a woman to be able to inspire other girls in computer science if you are a female or an underrepresented minority it's especially great to have you in violent Aryan because this to entirely see those role models in the tech field or in their career path and sometimes that can discourage girls from feeling like they should do computer science because they don't necessarily see women doing it so you know I especially encourage people in underrepresented minority groups or females to get out there and and be visible at this time for the classrooms and for the students if you have another one another person who you work with who you think would be great drag them out to ya and get them to also show up and be a role model for the kids as people enjoy talking to kids I think all of you do where you want to be on this call and then just seem that Suzy has some of their optimism kids are you know they're excited about it right this is one of those you know for the kids it's a really special day in school like this is a this is sort of a holiday for them it's an exciting moment like they're gonna get to do the power of code today and they're gonna you know build something and so it's pretty it's pretty exciting for them to do it and if you could share your excitement with them I think you'll just see it like reverberate and just comes back at you really exciting way um so we've had lots and lots and lots of teachers tell us how helpful it is to have a volunteer in their classroom it really makes a big difference for them and in particular you know I think it makes the biggest difference for the teachers who are the most you know unsure about technology or unsure about computer science for the teachers who have never tried this before this can make a really big difference for those two your presidents can really give them that confidence of how easy it is to get your students to try it because a lot of it is very selfservice students just go on it they try it they don't need the help of the teacher and that way they get excited about teachers to get excited about see how they can also do it themselves we also see teachers who will I think this one of the volunteers was telling me they got called back because they helped one teacher with it and then the neighbor heater was like oh can I help me and can help me and instead of going back and helping every single class at the elementary school just pulled it over and over again to help out because once they started helping the teachers were like oh I could do that too I personally have had classes where I go in and the teacher had one class at a secondgrade class where the teacher was beforehand was telling me like I don't know if we should do this like I've never done this before I don't even teach tech stuff on the computers like I don't even know how to setup the computers I you know are you sure we should do this like yes yes yes let's do it let's do it and and she must have called or checked in with me three or four times beforehand to be like you know you got it right like you're got their lesson plan I'm not in charge of anything and then like calling back hey so you're gonna run this class right because I'm not running it you're running it and so I got there we did it at the end of it she said to me she's like that was really fun the kids really liked it do you think we can do this every week like if we were teaching it not with me she didn't even come in every week she wanted to keep doing it on her own because she realized she could so I think you know the teachers being able to help the teachers you know give them the confidence and support to make this first step is a huge piece yeah for the question from somebody said they'd like to know if most volunteers actually teach her experience the teacher is just one thing to like talk about their career so oh yeah that's a great question it totally varies on what the teacher wants us wants help with we listed as both to the teacher so on the teacher facing parts of the website they see like a big thing saying get a volunteer speaker for your classroom and if they click that they get contacted it contacts you it we also say do you want help with a volunteer in your classroom for our code if they click that they get connected to you if they you know anything any really any help and so the teachers will reach out you guys are special in multiple ways you're special because you are comfortable with computers you're comfortable technology and you can help a teacher who doesn't know how to do this to lead the hour of code with their class but you're also a reallife connection to somebody with a job in the industry or in school studying computer science or maybe you studied computer science maybe you're not a computer scientist but maybe you're using your tech skills another role like you know maybe you're doing data science when we do market you do something with your tech background and it is really cool for the classrooms to talk to a person who actually does that job so some of the volunteer opportunities are can you speak to the entire class school like well yeah like we've had volunteers who go into the auditorium and they bring a whole school assembly and you're speaking to the school about what life is like as a as a software engineer sometimes it's with the classroom and they just want to bring in a reallife software engineer and the class will just ask you questions about it and sometimes it's helping out actually doing the hour of code with the class it's you know if you're working with the teacher and helping organize what the event is going to look like I would recommend that if you only have one hour it is super interesting to learn about software engineering from the car engineer but it is better to actually get the kids to do it themselves so if I if I'm working with a class and then we have one hour got one activity we can do I would encourage them to actually do the hour of code just answer like five minutes of questions at the end about my career what I do if you can encourage this to go further then it's really fun to do both to have the hour of code where the kids get to build it themselves and then also some time to ask you questions and learn about what a career in software is like socially every teacher will have the same need so if they are asking for the help that you're not competent it's okay let's not require that you have to actually teach the activity and even teaching it's like it's very minimal it's really easy that to say alright this is our code this is what it's about and we're gonna try it you direct us to the outer productivity's page I think the first one you know so if you are feeling extra balanced okay communicate the teacher what the expectations are and start that as part of your preparation that's a good point and if it's not a good fit for you there lots of other volunteers on the site so if you're like hey this isn't something that I'm the right person for I would encourage the teacher to pick somebody else from the list so hey this is a good transition so one of the questions was what you know if I'm asked to talk about my job what should I talk about and how to talk about my job so these are five best practices that will are you know designed to encourage especially diverse students to think that computer science is something they can do so the first is don't talk just about the code you write talk about the goals you're trying to achieve right for a kid it's gonna be less interesting whether you're writing in reactor you know whatever framework or JavaScript but what they found is that especially with girls everyone encouraged more diversity in computer science with girls and underrepresented minorities they want to see what they're gonna do with code so first thing is to talk about what you do with code what do you actually build and what do you accomplish with it and I was talking to one volunteer who was saying like well I it's like really backend right like I work to make sure datacenter failover works and you know I don't I sure I'm going to talk to kids about that right and so I'd say like zoom out and think about well okay you know you're working on data center feel over how why do we have data center failover and how can you put that in terms like that kids might understand like you make sure that the internet doesn't go that was a huge fire and like the whole internet burned up this building like you need to to save all their data and their projects and you know and you're a part of making that happen but yeah think about how the larger goals that you're trying to create and then you know as much as possible turn it back on them when you're in front of a classroom asking the kids to answer questions is a great way to get engagement get them excited and make them really thin for themselves about what they want to do so you know I would flip it around and ask the kids you know what do you want to build what app would you want to make get like a whole room people so telling you what video game they're gonna make but it's super fun and they're excited or even just asking them what do they like what are they interested in the show that computer science really spans every industry you can connect what they like to what they might want to do in the future and show how CS help solve those problems yeah that's an awesome one to do another thing to think about is breaking the stereotype you know we hear people say I just talked to a girl who's a senior in high school her favorite class was computer science but she was thinking she didn't want to major in college because she wanted to work with other people I kind of broke my heart I'm like you will work with other people but if you have if you can help break the stereotype that computer science is something that we do all by ourselves think about an example in your job where you've worked with other people to solve a problem and share that that's part of you know helping helping them understand that computer science is not something that is done alone in your basement I mean it can be but most large software projects are not done alone they're done with very large teams working together and what your job that's an obvious one share something you love and the last one is something that I think sometimes we forget about doing especially with kids it's really intimidating to think that yeah computer science is something that you have to be you know I to be a mathlete or I have to be really smart or I can never fail if I ever like and and computer science is all about failure right I when you write software it just doesn't work the first time right and part of what Tina's persistence and grit and like failing keep trying and you know if you can model that for them about you know when I try it it's gonna fail a lot broke inside to fix it right over again things change all the time yeah any example that you have where they didn't go right the first time it shows that you made mistakes if you learn from it everybody does that's everybody everybody does yeah you know the time you applied for a job and didn't get it and try it again you know those are all great stories so I would think about how you can you know we all want to be our best selves but think about the times where you know you had a tough spot and that's really relatable to the to the kids so why wait to be contacted you can reach out especially in the Silicon Valley type areas or high tech hubs there's a lot of volunteers and you may not have a teacher reach out to you that doesn't mean there aren't teachers who are not offering this who totally could and should if you reached up to them I now is a fantastic time to start reaching out to if you have any connection to a school reach out to them and offer to help them do this that second grade teacher I was talking about didn't reach out on our website because she never reached up above our website so if you but when I went to her she's like okay okay we can do this right I mean they've heard of our code maybe they're excited about doing it the easiest is if you have kids reach out to your kids teachers because you already can't get to that school it's an obvious thing for you to volunteer in the classroom and help out maybe you have a friend who's a teacher and you can offer it to help them out in their classroom be a fun way to see what your friend gets to deal with every day um good and the bad right maybe your you volunteer at a school maybe your company volunteers with a school so maybe you guys have a relationship with a school through your company I would say you know what connected you have if you have any connection to any school in your area this is great opportunity to reach out proactively and we've got some sample letters on the website that you can send so you don't need to like come up with something from scratch to help you get started they're also after school organizations do you you know these are sometimes easier to get started with they usually don't have computers but you don't need computers to do the hour of code you can actually without a ton of activities for kids to learn computational thinking practices with no computers so group that meets in a local church can definitely do an hour of code so any any afterschool organization the other thing about these afterschool organizations is they don't have sort of all of the rigidity of a public school system so they can be a little bit more flexible in terms of you know when they meet how they me how you help they may even be interested in in coming to your work for the event like you know I can imagine I imagine I've seen you know things like you know a Girl Scout troop might come to your office and that could be a fun activity like you can be a little bit more flexible with some of these afterschool clubs and organizations so if you're connected to anything offer to help you can also offer to help with a friends kids so maybe you've got a friend who's got a child at a school and you can offer to help out at their school and we've got tools to help you reach out to as well so you don't have to do this on your own and this should a question it's kind of on the flip side and one says that they've already had several requests from teachers in their area and because there aren't a lot of volunteers in their area yeah what can they do when they just can't help anymore oh oh okay so here's what I would do first is can you recruit other people at your office I might want to volunteer because I think there's a lot of people who would love to volunteer you know once a year in a classroom but don't think to do it see if you can you can get them to sign up on our website or just directly connect them let you feel free to just connect that teacher directly to somebody at your office if you could convince somebody else to help out if not I would encourage the teachers to find a remote dear teachers might not be searching for it but there are more than enough volunteers who are never contacted if they look for remote volunteers they'll be able to find so take a major city filter dr. Montag hear that oh yeah no more options tell them to try San Francisco look for my volunteers absolutely fine yeah how to run an hour of code okay so first check in with the teaching I need to know what technology you have you don't need any technology but if you've got computers you should know you have computers if your iPads if you die pad so figure out what the what you're using and then on our website you can filter this little check boxes you can filter based on the technology you have the easiest two things to do if you want to go easy especially you're not at the school to set it up is to do something that works on browsers or to do something with no technology needed so an unplugged activity requires more work to set up like you'll need to like if you're doing your staff and cups you'll need to bring cups we need to read the activity guides we need to prepare to teach that class the ones on the computers a lot of them are selfserve like you just put the kids in front of the computers and they'll work through it but you do need to have computers with internet connection there are also lots of activities that run on things like iPads but if you're going to use those you would need to install the apps and if you're not at the school you may not want to deal with making sure the app is installed on every iPad so the browser ones are the easiest ones to to use and most of the browser works also even still work I might add and mobile only they just have to open the browser on their device yeah exactly so this it says modern browsers and it'll be filtered so you can see like all of these will work on any device and then the easiest to do all of the activities require no sign up no sign in no login so you don't have to prep you just have to make sure the activity works and that's it I recommend checking at the school if possible and getting a teacher to check at the school a lot of schools have firewalls in place to prevent skids to go to a site fish and beyond and so as a result you can try it at home and it works great and then tried in the classroom it might just be blocked so just picnic tutorial you want and ask the teacher to just click on it and make sure it works from within the school so day of and and then also with preparing you're going to want to make sure that like we mentioned before that you most public schools in America require a background check before anybody can volunteer in the classroom with kids so you want to make sure you've done whatever you need to do to volunteer at that school day of you signing with the school meet the teacher we recommend spending most of the time getting the kids to actually build something on the activity because that's what you want them to walk away feeling like they can do this right so spend a few minutes introduce yourself talk about why computer science is exciting and we talked a little bit how to do that let the kids do it finish up you graduate the class and if your company has stickers kids love stickers any kind of slide that that is a picture of us in a classroom handing out or code.org stickers because that's the stickers we have it I recommend talking to the teacher before you give them out in case they want to save it for the end of the days that is exactly the bill the day and yeah make sure you bring a lot though they're gonna be more than your students okay I don't see I'm Hannah you should also keep in mind is if you plan on some pictures and sharing about your exposure to experience on social media please make sure you ask the teacher that's okay because technically you should be allowed to post pictures of these students unless they've signed it really so sometimes so just ask teachers see if that's okay before you post any pictures of the students and most schools have like we'll know which kids have signed the release in which ones haven't so they'll be like getting to pictures of these kids but not these ones the other thing that you don't see on here should add is the certificates kids love certificates and we can as part of this we have a website when you go to the howto one of the steps is to print out certificates for all the kids then something you can't do the teacher can do because they know the names of all the students in the class but I would encourage your teacher beforehand to print out certificates for all the students and that you guys can hand them out and the kids can take them home and hang them on the wall and show their parents they love these certificates every year they collect the remains slightly different so the teachers to pick those out grab if they can yeah and then obviously encourage your school to go further and these are the teacher resources or a coda or teach and the other one is code.org slash your school and we'll send both those URLs so you have the URLs you want me to reprise those right now we have a link to the volunteer toolkit here we're gonna send that out as well it goes through everything in depth that you need and we also want to save some time for any questions anybody has has anybody take any questions you don't have any questions right now feel free to put it in the live chat you can answer any questions thank you guys for volunteering really appreciate the work that you're doing it makes a huge difference it really helps teachers to be able to offer this and it helps the students to see a real human who does this job especially for the students who grow up especially for the students who grow up in a place where maybe nobody they've ever met is doing this right like this is a mythical job field that they've never met anybody who does you know software engineering for a job and you know being able to be in a school where no kid has ever done software engineering and their parents don't do it at their uncles don't do it and then being able to be that role model for them of you know hey this is something that people do and here I do it and here's what I build and it demystifies it and I think it feels much more accessible and approachable yeah one comment now I just want to make is that in the description in this video we have a link to the tool kit that Alice mentioned as well as the resources on our website where you can find for how to get involved if you haven't signed up already there's a place to sign up you can see how your information is listed on the map where teachers view it and after this is over we'll add to that description the slides that we still have all of those resources that you need we have a question here about where can we get stickers where can you get stickers so most people just give out the stickers from their office because it's like hey I work it you know Microsoft so here are Microsoft stickers if you want to give code.org stickers on Kota on the our koat.com site there's a resources tab and under there there's a way to print out stickers handouts flyers like everything you might want it also has some videos that you can play to inspire the class and those are a great way to kick things off especially if you're not as comfortable you know kicking things off yourself in front of the classroom a video is a great way to get the kids all excited quiet sitting down paying attention and then you can talk after that so I like to when I when I teach I like to the hour go to the classroom I actually like to run the video first I'll pick one of the twominute ones so it's quick and the kids get sort of it sort of amps the excitement in the air right like it's music and and celebrities and I was playing one of them and little kids are like they need more slippery than I did there like someone said I hope to get contacted but we'll also look at reaching out myself to a school in the area and I just wanted to highlight that I think you know because obviously the people that you find on the website the teachers that will be reaching out to you our teachers who already decided to do the hour of code but what would be amazing is if all of you or many of you went out to schools and found teachers who didn't know about the hour of code or who weren't already planning to do this and so it just helps us to spread it so yeah definitely teacher you know you can wait and teachers may contact you but by all means don't feel like you need to wait like outside reach out and talk to those schools someone says my kid is in middle school who at my kids school should I reach out to so if your kids in middle school they're multiple choices some schools have a tech person or a librarian or somebody who has services in between classes that's a great person to talk to you can also look at talking to the science teacher or the math teacher this can be a really fun activity for one of those subjects and this year we actually have subjectspecific orioles so you can actually tie it into something there so you know you can tell you can either go sit with a science teacher and say hey let's do one hour of computer science as part of science generally or you can say something like a math teacher they actually have tutorials that teach angles and the computer science at the same time let's do this angles activity as part of you know one class period and it'd be a fun way to like teach the kids a little bit about computer science let them see this and also you know they'll do a little bit of math there's this in a disciplinary aspect we actually have this for almost every activity you know there's a there's examples on the website of like a history activity where they research the history of English computer science yeah like race how're you know yeah yeah and learn about learn about the history of computer science that was less fun for you to teach us on out but but I think in middle school when they have those subjects you know pick a subject or you think you have more of a chances sometimes a question about is it possible to run webbased apps from a browser I've had our Android tablet so that they don't need to have apps installed absolutely and most of our webbased ones will work that way from most of the providers all the code org tutorials the ones we built ourselves are design to work in a web browser on Android or iPad and they've been tested that way they work great so you can either drag and drop and the full experience designed to work on a browser on an iPad and we did it that way rather than installing an app so it would be easier for you to run it in the classroom without having to install apps in advance yeah that's just to say hi to their friend Brendan in our office we'll do that [Laughter] so we made a comment that you know what we went to City High School interested in how much money you can make an IT I thought it was pretty smart and forwardthinking about to kids about that yeah yeah you know what if it motivates the kids who are you how much money I think personally it's always an awkward question to say a lot if you work hard I think we have some stats on the website that you can use to if you're asked those questions and it shows how much more if you have code.org slash stats oh she's putting it on.the we'll add that link to put them but if you want some stats about why computer science is interesting or how how much money they will make in computer science let's see here Wizards have a stock up compares your first students who dog graduate college students graduate college that's how a computer science degree of students to capture a college with a computer degree they make almost three times as much as students who cheat at cards waiting with yeah it's the difference between graduating with a high school degree versus a college degree is about the same as the difference between graduating with a college degree and graduate of the college degree in computer science they make forty percent more than an average in the Army Major yeah an average computer college graduate so yeah it's a good career you can make money what are some other like motivations if it's not money like what would you say to some students in a classroom to motivate them to think about studying computer science I think mostly you know the the research is that like enabling you to solve problems in the world like that's what's motivating to a lot of students so if they think of themselves as creators of software instead of just users of software and you get them thinking about like well what is a problem that I want to solve whether that might be a lot of it's a local problem in their school like maybe there's a you know bullying problem in their school or you know maybe it's just how do i healthy foods at lodge or you know just local local problems they have or problems that they see outside in the world like how can I help the environment with computer sense what kind of app could I create that would help the environment and that's something that is motivating for students whatever cause they care about I think it's just reiterating that a lot of people think it's only math and science you have to be strong in that but actually it is very creative and we get to design things or break down a problem into different ways and that way it is created because you can solve it somebody may seem to decide what's good what's bad when one of the tradeoffs so emphasize they may know have to be a super math and Cypress if anybody can really learn how to the core concepts of computer science and like why but key thing for me and I think a lot of people is that computer science can impact so many things and it can be used different ways and particularly for a person who has so many interests it doesn't know where to go and computer science if you change your writing you want to be an accountant and then you want to go to entertain they're there you want to go into agriculture you're going to have you can we use those skills in any industry you don't need to start over and go back school yeah if kids are excited to like that they the research shows that especially girls are excited to solve problems with computer science so the more you can tie it to those what they care about and what problems they're trying to solve and then get my math is you get a ton of kids who want to make video games every year every time and that's okay too that's okay too if they want to if they want any love you know if they're one study computer science so they can make video games or their own version of snapchat that's better than the version that's out there or you know apps they use you know that's fantastic I knew had someone who made it very comment about as far as who you should talk to you in the school it's in the you know toggle they found in their experience it's always best to talk directly to the teacher they've done that for a few times with their kids classes it always starts they said if your kids in middle school usually you can start with a homeroom teacher and that would be someone you're getting you help yourself thank you yeah that is a great idea yeah my kids in the middle school doesn't have home rooms but but yes if your kids have homeroom Advisors that's all so usually they're advocates for the students and that's a great place to start great idea what questions so feel free to send them questions if you have them I just want to reiterate the resources from the description of the video and you know check back we'll be adding some of the links that you know as alice has been mentioning different resources on our website I'll be sure to add those there as well so you have a nice onestop shop for all of those resources and you know if you're nervous and you haven't done this before just try one of the hours of code like do you it Chinese yeah go to our cook our first one it doesn't matter any of the top six are all really easy to use great for getting started and you just pick one of them and try it out and you'll get a really good sense of what its gonna be like in the classroom the they're designed to be self pay for students so you don't need to tell the student what to do you just set them in front of the computers and the activity guides itself and you can just answer questions or you know helps us do that's out and in fact you get questions it's actually better to tell us to ask your neighbor and I try to figure out themselves so even then it's not a lot of you because it's like well why don't you see if you know if you're walking through the classroom yet helping a student I have a question put it back on that why do you think that and you'll be surprised don't think about anything like oh okay let me try this instead so there's no pressure even if you haven't tried it tutorial if they're doing you the best way to help with sort of the Socratic method ask them more questions and get that visitor arrived at the plate looking ya can help like foster growth mindset of the students and I keep trying and also teach them cooperation with each other we have a little thing on our side this is ask three than me so ask three students before you ask me and that also helps the students figure things out and feel really empowered when they figure it out together if a lot of students also pair program which keep their could be two students per device on a laptop or an iPad and that's also a mily recommended especially if you don't have enough devices for each do it we can still do the our code and that way that when they're paired with each other they could bounce off ideas of it exactly someone made a comment that city on the map for volunteers searching doesn't work for them they're specific city oh no I was just going to say if you email volunteers at code.org with any issues that you have with your kind of your listing and we're working got a couple of things before we get to the our code hopefully actually dr. description but there are a couple of things that we're working through some anytime you see a choice to let us know absolutely and we're trying to make that as soon as possible you to edit your preferences for you to see yourself a map in the right place any other questions great well thank you again for volunteering with love that you guys are going to be in the classroom and good luck if you have any questions you can always reach us we're here at once here's a code that are oh yeah yep volunteers at code.org great thank you
