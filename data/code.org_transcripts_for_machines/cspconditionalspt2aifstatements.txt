our daily lives are filled with decisions big and small even simple choices like what to wear usually are the result of complex considerations what's the weather going to be like what will you be doing today do you feel like making an impression or keeping it casual but the world around us is constantly changing so we want to adapt the choices we make to match the changing conditions what's true for humans is also true for computer programs we don't want our programs to always run in the same way they should respond to changing conditions in the last video we learned how to use Boolean Expressions to establish whether something is true or false we can now add something called a conditional statement to help guide the computer's decisions based on that information the simplest conditional statement is an if statement it says that if something is true the computer should run a specific block of code let's say that you want to create a program that displays whether or not you are old enough to see a PG13 movie so the question we want the computer to evaluate is if age is greater than or equal to 13 the question or Boolean expression goes next to the if the block of code we want to run only if the condition is true goes inside the if statement so in our example whenever the expression a greater than or equal to 13 is true the program will write to the screen that you are old enough to see a PG13 movie
