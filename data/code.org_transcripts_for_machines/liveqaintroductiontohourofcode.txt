hello and welcome to the first ever hour of code code org google hangout on air this is a new technology that we're trying out as a way of reaching all of the great organizers who are helping tribute to making our coded big successes here we have 50 viewers so far so if you're one of them that's great we're going to start in about 30 seconds all the way for a few more people to join in I just want to say there's this question and answer application on the side of the screen and while we're going on while we're we're giving the first few minutes worth of introductions and background feel free to contribute questions of anything you're interested in learning about if someone's already asked a question and you want to sort of second it this little plus button you can click we will be answering the questions in the order of whichever ones get the most pluses I'm working our way down so thank you for all of you guys are checking in unfortunate is not a great way to chat here so let's try to keep the questions to actual questions for conducting the hour of code and although I do appreciate all the enthusiasm and passion we're seeing from from from any of you so with that I'm actually going to start by turning it over to the executive director of the code org organization and also founder of this whole ablation in movement how deep are Toby hi hi everybody I had no idea when we launched the first code org video featuring Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and Jack Dorsey what a amazing reception there would be you know 20 million views later and thirteen thousand schools asking us for help later at this project has grown too much much bigger than I would have expected and what's been especially amazing is with the hour of code movement you know it was literally an idea that got hatched about three months ago and and four weeks after announcing it it's now already on track to be the largest education event in history with you know with 1.9 million kids already signed up to do it and that the current rate of growth were were well on track to each 3 million kids by the time CS Education Week comes around so we're really excited about it and you the biggest message I want to say is at the point of the hour of code campaign isn't necessarily to grow computer scientists or to get people ready to jump into computer science as a major or deaf jobs or whatnot it's just to get people introduced just to understand what is this thing about and to help them realize that anybody can do it everybody can do it and especially that it's not just for white men that girls can do it that Latinas can do it afternoon Americans could do it you know basically want to create a sense of community and together and that's that everybody in the world is trying this thing the skill that is not taught in our schools so more important than anything else is to basically emphasize the inclusiveness when when going to this process and this sort of through the actual hour of code and then that interest one thing in games isn't going to say at the end of this talk and I'll say at the beginning is you know if you're hosting an hour of code and you're excited about it please recruit one other organizer teacher or host to do the same thing if the it's a 10,000 people who have already signed up to host it each recruit one other person will reach 5 million kids which is even more impressive than where we already I have that all said James gonna come back to walk through some more details ok thank you honey later my name is James Bergstrom the chief evangelist here at code.org and I've been helping organize a lot of the information materials around the hour of code exercise itself and so we're going to you today is we're going to go through some of the steps needed to actually set up and run the hour of code itself at your school my comms only be a few minutes and then we'll turn it over to the questions so let me go over here and do a screen capture I want to start the single biggest question we get from everyone is people asking how do I see the actual tutorials what are the tutorials and so let me quickly jump over and show that's going to look like so if I do a screen share here and I go to this web page so okay so it is right yes so this URL because CS Edwin org slash learn to this URL is the public beta preview of all of these tutorials that we're going to be offering during the out for the hour of code during sales education week and they're grouped into different categories not all the tutorials in here a final many of the two tools here are in still a beta state that are not completely finished and in fact there are some tutorials on here that might not be on here it will need funded alive and there might be some tutorials not on here that will be on there when we find a go live but this is a good starting point and you can see that we've got it organized by category we've got tutorials for beginners we have tutorials for teachers and schools with no computers at all these are so called unplugged tutorials that you can do with no computer all we have some slightly more advanced tutorials does it actually teach JavaScript an actual programming language that looks like what people often think code is with with text tutorials for any device including things like iPhones iPads Android phones and so forth and find tutorials that create actual apps for devices like phones and finally other various learning options each of these categories has several different tutorials inside of it so for example this patrol here if you're wondering if your teacher wondering I don't want to do my own research I just want a single tutorial which one should I do this is one you should do is the one that we built ourselves here at code.org it is a if they polished a relatively easy to use graphical way of learning people sites and also take you into in a second show what it looks like but there are others there's this one there is scratch which is created a builder holiday card tutorial Khan Academy's created very similar induction of JavaScript and so song so the number of ones you can go through here and try it out what i'm gonna do i'm going to quickly show you what this looks like and then we will come back to mother house so if you could go it will take you in jersey shore GTL the video and it takes you into the to talk self and in this tutorial for example students will be moving these blocks and graphical blocks around to create a program to solve a series of simple trouble and we start off very simple they get more complicated and along the way students learning the actual concepts of computer science so even though it makes you later playing a game by the time they're done going through these 28 puzzles as part of the hour of code they will have learned some basic principles of computer science they'll have learned about four loops if statements the notion that a program is simply a series of commands like a recipe the computer doesn't order they learned how literal computers can be and has sometimes you know your first program doesn't always work and use often debug it go through several times and that is a very simple tutorial which will satisfy the hour of code so the back to the ER and so that that is a way for you to try out the opcode and see what the tutorials look like in terms of mechanics what we're expecting at this point is each of you who've signed up or thinking of signing up represent or work with this group of students either in a school setting or perhaps an app to school organization and we're going to be doing is you're going to be by signing up to do the hour of code you're saying you're going to bring those students at some point during CS Education Week december nine to fifteen you will set aside roughly an hour with your students to sit down and do one of the tutorials either the one I just showed you or one of the other tutorial options that's available and and if at this point if you're honest if you're attending this Web cast we're listening to this you already have all the tools you need in order to do the RF code even if your school and he has one computer or even know computers you can do the Arctic oh the ideal situation that would be if your students can each have a device of some sort in front of them that they can use the RF code either by themselves or paired up two or three students per device doesn't have to be PC for example of got here a tablet this is a heaven of an iPad what we also have other device is working and so for example here we have that same tutorial screen and if you actually hit go here you'll see it will launch the same puzzle we just looking at descriptively here you can see I'm actually doing the exact same program that I was just that's just running one program and you can see the anger break getting the pagan to the next level so that's that's the same in couture running on a tablet device it also went six part phones and and we're working on making sure we have compatibility with a whole bunch of different browser devices on PCs tablets Android surface and so forth so if you have access to devices you have what you need your goal is to sit down with your classroom go to the tutorials chosen every student will have a very very simple sana process they essentially uh actually when you sit down to the hour of code you go right into the tutorial and end the tutorial it a couple questions that are optional and then we'll be tracking how many students begin your hour of code using through those pages and that's how we'll know how many students ultimately participate in the hour of code and I think that's all I really want to talk about today so I guess I have a couple of does a couple of housekeeping option things we've got a lot of questions from teachers about that a lot of question from teachers about the prizes we're offering so for example we've announced that every teacher who does the hour of code will receive a free dropbox account you don't those dropbox account will be given out after the hour of code is over so to qualify you to be signed up if they've gone to the cs Edwin org site you have to registered to do the hour of code and after the arm comes over all the teachers who've registered who actually did the hour of code when we receive the instructions from us on how to get your dropbox account another thing is we often get asked by teachers is how do they start how do they start doing the our code with their with their students an answer is that the cs edward website will have a video on the homepage starting december ninth and that video is the best place to start the hour of code with your students so if you get into a classroom you sit down the students go to the page you can show them that video that will be on the homepage of side work that will be a short inspiring video explaining uh inspiring them to do the RF code and then each of them will then go in and begin the extra tutorial the tutorials of design selfteaching if you have some computer background yourself that's great but even if you have absolutely no prior experience with technical savvy it's okay once you get your students into the hour of code tutorials these tools will take over do themselves and if students get stuck and you're unable to answer the questions I'm sure some the other students people to help them out because they're meant to be so easy if you're in a school or class and slightly more technically advanced you're welcome to try some the more advanced tutorials and if your students finish the beginning tutorial very quickly they're welcome to go back and try some more advanced tutorials on their own if you have extra time left over so that uh so they've out sit around around waiting and with that let's go to the questions let's see what have here so the first question we have seven here first what we have is I would love to hand out stickers or swag to our students for participating I'm happy to buy from outside vendor but can we get our raw image to me plate absolutely so on the show you over here on the cs ed week meet me just a second r you guys jump over to screen share ok on the cs edited org website itself the very bottom we have a link to encode the resource kit and to go to the resource kit those are all the materials that might be helpful to you in putting other materials for the hour of code and so for example if you go to the logos section if you are some logos you can use if you go to for example banners we have some matters that you can use images here your local use and your materials we're doesn't have links here for example to poster so you can print out and adapt the back to the question which are answer the question in terms of stickers drag are we okay putting the coded org logo up with people to download yes okay so the one that if you go to logos page right here the one logo that's not on here if you want to give out the actual code org logo the co de in a box will make it available as well those those those make a great sticker for kids who are excited by computer science and want to to show that so we'll make that available steadily ball and but we do ask you not modify that logo or combine it with other material you have to use it logo by self as a standalone entity um that's one thing we ask yeah how do you feel with everything on a poster they create themselves the critical participative school songs it's not referring to yeah yeah so if you if you want to create your own directory if you want to create your own hour of code poster with your and you want to put the codes at our logo on there that's fine we just ask that you not use it for something it's not our of code or I see said we've related okay so next question we have on here is do I need to ask my students to register when they do the hour of code when students need to enter their email addresses no students do not engage their email addresses teachers can go to the when your students begin the hour of code there's no registration process needed up front students can go right into the tutorial at the end of the tutorial there is a optional set of questions the last questions like their gender age no guys gonna step in here AB so our tutorial doesn't require entering your email address nor do most of the sort of most popular ones and we've asked from anybody who's submitting tutorials to not require sign up there are some people who are requiring sign up on their tutorials and we're putting those at the bottom of the list because for two reasons for the children's privacy but also just to remove an extra step required before you start doing it at the end of the hour of code when you when you know finish and it gives you through the congrats message there's two optional things a student can do they can optionally enter their email address to get a certificate of completion and me an email and they can optionally say are they a boy or a girl or really to to donate their one hour to the boys team with the girls team because we want to basis create a small competition of to effectively show that girls can do this too and we highly suspect both hit 50 50 participation by boys and girls and we're actually not saving that information on a peruser basis it's just a vote because it's not really a skating of the person's gender now we are also curating a whole bunch of followon tutorials for people who want to go beyond an hour which is basically if you're interested and you thought this was great and you want to learn more there's a whole bunch of option for learning more and those are longer than one hour tutorials every single one of those has some form of signup involved it was have nothing to do with the hour of code and those are basically for the student who wants to learn on their own they can do it on some of those required email address some of those 25 pounds emailed us some require your teachers email address and it depends on which one you choose and those are all basically not required as part of the hour of code ok ok ok ok ok you can take Eric aceticus that's next question we have is from Dora Spencer she's asking um right so she's asking she sees she sees where the students could get a certificate but the emails required to get the certificate I'm gonna live to school students died email I could use my email that would swamp me is there a certificate we can post you can download and use and I see no reason we can't post a generic certificate form when we can go to that you're also open create your own certificate form if you want to use that so purpose the certificate we email out will be a this be an image that has their name and some other information on there um ok yes Walter to note of that and post it in that resources Katie saw the reason we required during the way that is to personalize it with our names they receive it at home if they're doing it at school yeah yeah we also felt and the other thing that is it when we do mail it out to the students there is gonna be some information on there for parents in case parents want to learn more where the student did and get more involved in cells for example helping encourage their students been working for your science ok next question will we make the video on CS Edwin org available for download on a site other than youtube is blocked so many schools so we've actually made a lot of efforts not so although videos on our website we've made effort not to let through youtube I rather to link through education a special version of YouTube specifically for educational institutions which in theory is not blocked so we're making an effort to make sure that our videos are not blocked the promotional video as well as all the videos that we have on there now our level for download in fact there are if you go to the resources kit videos you can actually download those videos as files with you and then download your laptop and show so if you don't have a working internet connection you can download those videos ahead of time and show them your classroom hope that answers that question next question another question was can we use a coded org logo in our event posters arrested yes you can we'll make that a local available off of our website to download as long as the event posters are specifically for cle for our foot events the other question is there a special logo for the hour of code now we need a conscious decision not to create a logo for the hour of code itself because we don't you didn't want hour of code to be seen as a special branded uh entity the hour of code more concept to theme for this year's CS education week and so there is no hour of code logo we're purposely using the words hour of code every time we talk about it and that's why there's no no logo for that ok next question we are an NGO proteincoding in Hong Kong and we're very happy to learn the hour of code other cooperation opportunities with code org I'm so coded org we're essentially a clearinghouse or artwork submission of coded org is to ensure that every student has the opportunity to learn computer science so we promote organizations and we promote opportunities for students to learn computer science that said we can't partner with and get direct involved in all the various amazing activities that so many of you are responsible for around the world so the best we can do is we can link to and and and and provide references to education opportunities or those are online courses or tutorials hour of code and occasionally we will call out and highlight on are very social media channels notable articles or then so we think are relevant to computer science education but we're not really in a position to directly partner with a lot of these local events we really see this as an opportunity to view to be doing amazing things around the world in pursuit of computer science and when we see things that we think are optimized to promote will mention about our channels but if but for this particular example if you want to have a kid cody competition or if you want to run a code day campaign hong kong go for it do it and and and and we think it's fantastic and we don't think we need our help to pull that off ok let's see you next wishin my class period is only 40 minutes can still do the RF code of course you can the RF code is more concept it's not literally a 60minute only activity and in fact we believe many students can probably get through our tutorial behave in just half an hour and if the students don't finish it's okay they can still exit early and get credit for completing the hour of code or they can come back to try to finish it there on their own time okay someone's desk is now what's the link again for showing the angry bird so yes so the the link is CS adweek org slash learn to sew again that is discourtesy sorry org but once an hour we will do dude will do is live together so we'll go to the second word says what's an hour of code the first thing Thursday yeah so going to select org okay so here's the CSO Drita org web page and write down here in the very center once an hour of code right here where it says will provide a variety of tutorials if you click on that actually even easier ones devices check out tutorials in beta click on that link check out tutorials and data and that takes you right to the tutorials in beta and the very very first one here the one is right and center where since tutorials for beginners write your first program at code.org hit the Go button and this takes you to the angry bird to face two toilets now and you can use these buttons the top here to skip ahead for example if you're feeling ambitious i want to see a little 19 you can screw head to level 19 and that's just you get you show them better how did not just dismiss the videos which shorts to the notes for the videos yeah that's the one and one thing um den Devon yeah so one thing I accept endows of you through some reason you you don't have actors in your classroom you can actually click over and and go through these notes and actually get the same information in a non video format so if you're one of those teachers ask you our institutions of blocks videos for whatever reason you can always look at the notes here against a information one thing i should note is uh the videos will be conducted by some notable tech celebrities which is a lot of fun so those videos actually be more than just information they'll be kind of fun to watch to buy some folks you'll recognize and in fact in fact when you go to tools now you'll you'll see some days includes a couple Mark Zuckerberg teaching about loops Bill Gates teaching about the if statements and other so that's almost exactly a lot of fun okay next question what languages are the hour of code available in we are making a big effort to have the hour of code localized into as many languages as we can in fact right now there's a huge volunteer effort underway to localize the hour of code into like 100 plus different languages in fact if i want to show you I can reup these languages we already have German Indonesian Portuguese Portuguese Brazilian Romanian done we will have by the time it launches russian italian norwegian French Greek Dutch at least and Chinese if James is fencing tronic tofu for us and a few students if any on this phone call to help us localize where can they go just the children of the the process where they go to the bottom that footage of the footer okay so deposited with it right okay so so at the very bottom yes it's very bottom of the tutorial page you can see help us translate to your language click that button and you can sign up here uh and it will actually listen information on how to translate actually here right it can also go to code.org / translate just just really reference / their work / translate and this is another is all the materials on how two triangles you can go here find information we'd love to have your help translating the RF code go back okay next question we have I can't do the hour of code during see said week because I final exams and so what I do before and after abs we would love you to the our code during seaside week because you can't that's fine too doing the hour of code after or even Freddie the week before although the week before we're not quite sure exactly when all the absolute final materials will be posted but certainly you can do the article after she said we gots fine a fact we're thinking of the hour of code Beyonce said we may be be this perpetually ongoing process for anyone anytime can go in and do the RF code long after at the seaside week is over okay next question we've had some trouble getting learn code org to run properly on IE internet explorer did i hear you say you're working on a program running different browsers chrome works great but we don't have chrome on a student laptops we're making a huge effort to ensure compatibility across as mini laptop and is made browsers as possible I'm happy so the IE now works on I 98 ni 11 has yesterdays of yes as of yesterday we got over to 99 and I ate was so working i ate and it's a it's you know the older the browser we get the less supportive hat for some of the techniques we're using now first four hour of code we're trying to ensure to run is in mini spa scrub but one thing i should stand this is we are going to do browser to text if it's fine coming we're going to do browser detection for people's computers and if they're running on internet explorer will show the tutorials that work on in attics for for your browser service if students aren't stuck trying something it doesn't work on that particular browser the scratch tutorials in particular which it's a great one will work on pretty much any browser that has flash installed which all the older browsers thing when you see here see two thousand houston fishing um let's take a look a so so almost everyone is a beginner doing suggestion for which tutorials fit each grade or ages yes the tutorials will have a rough age breakdown to go to the tutorial page you will see some suggestions for different age ranges that said the code org to tour we've created we worked hard to make sure that really works from literally ages eight to an 88 so even if you have third graders second graders we've tested it on 44 year old and she was able to through quite a few levels herself so whether you're you know element in early let me to school all the way up to high school we've had high school students doing the beat that tutorial and fun of it and we you've even had you know uh folks in a welder 20s 30s 40s doing it as well current learn pitch suggests ages but those aren't exactly accurate yet pretty the way the delineation is going to be really beginners or intermediate that's actually more important than age because this advance its 10 year olds who already know scratch will find the beginner stuff boring frighten these high school students who've never done it before who will need to start at the elementary level that many classrooms will have a couple students who happen to party Venus was a program rather than them make a big deal about how easy this is and potentially demotivate some of their peers it's probably better for those two suits tribal more advanced tutorials while the true beginners in classroom do the e for our foot experience okay next how can i get a speaker from co.org to come to my school so unfortunately we would love we would love to send the speaker if we put it over to every school in this country sadly that's not something we can we can do what we can do however is encourage you to seek out tech technical mentors in your community you know across the country now for every community has some sort of local business that is involved in programming or science related activities and in our experienced engineers and and other professionals from those organizations are only too happy to come to schools and talk about the ports of computer science education we are hoping to pull the seuda that the last minute we have a database about twenty five five thousand engineers who want to help with computer science education and we're hoping in the next four weeks to basically line them up by location to give you a list of possible engineers near you could come to your school to help with the power code or to pick it off for it or if you're talking about what they do it their workplace icons like that what i will say is we are having as you may have seen from our website we are having a series of tech luminaries you know i'm kicking off the hour of code virtually using same technology we're using right now with number of different schools so for example we're going to have presumable gates has agreed to do a chat with up to 10 different classrooms alive and those 10 classrooms we will be picking those randomly those class hands to be interacting directly with bill however those chats will also be broadcast live via YouTube and other means after the fact so so any of you who want to have your classroom watch someone like for example said ok I off the our code you'll have that chance to show that they need to your classroom and that can be quite inspiring so you can't get a live speaker you can offer you a pre inspiring speaker virtually ok next question what is intended outcome for students after the hour of code uh you want to start with the end in mind of the students at cast a vision is consistent great question obviously the hour of code was just a one hour long thing and that was it it would be nothing more than a marketing stunt and and that's not that's not our intent so so part of what we're tending as a Java code is a way to demystify country science to spark that interesting and help students realize if your designs is not as intimidating as perhaps they thought it was and hopefully encourage them to go on and pursue a much longer and deeper interest in computer science so we ourselves have have created a 20 hour long online tutorial with the hour of code that that one hour long tutorial there were promoting is part of our code turns out that section just the first hour of a 20 hour long series of tutorials and we're encouraging teachers and students to to to those other on their own free time or actual encouraging students are the teachers to incorporate that 20 hour long creek elem into their own classrooms as part of say in math or science a track with in there within the classroom ok one thing that says kids in K through 12 grades almost none of them are actively thinking about jobs or developing a tech based business you know their parents are certainly thinking about that but you're yes the average eighth grader that's nowhere near on the horizon and there's really two messages that resonate well with kids in terms of why study this stuff one reason is that simply no matter what you want to do if you want to become a doctor or politician or accountant or a nurse this is something that's relevant to learn for the 21st century and the second message is building a cool smartphone app that you can share with you which way more kids are interested in that they're getting a job basically one great big changes so yep okay hold answer the question next question here what about caper based games if there's no computerized absolutely so when I mentioned that series of unplugged tutorials these are all paper based activities that you can do with little paper and pencil and no jaraxxus is a little bit of private operation involved as a teacher you need to conduct some materials ahead of time and otherwise prepare for it but you certainly don't need a computer to do those activities in fact you can do the outside or you list on the website yeah I guess you can go there now and try them out now and start preparing for those right now the next question someone's calling out that scratch requires flash what what devices like ipad or flash lyst computers i actually don't think scratch will run on the ipad awesome instead scratch requires flash which has strengths and weaknesses the benefit of that is that it will work on the older computers that don't support html5 but all have flash so if you're on internet explorer 8 or on a node Mac pre OS 10 or even three OS 10.4 you won't be able to run the newer tutorials such as the photo tutorial or you will be able to run scratch whereas on the iPad you can either download an app which somebody else asked a question for or you can run the code org tutorial or the snap tutorial there's basically three providers code.org snap and tinker that are in the draganddrop category that will work on an iPad without a download and it's a whole bunch of these but if you download will work my iPad but if you're an older browser you should be scratch and to help make this easy for you since you know I know this all in my head that it's not as obvious if you visit the tutorial page with the computer you want to use it should sort the most relevant category to the top so if you're on an Internet Explorer browser it will show you these are tutorials that work within explore if you're on a mobile browser it should show your tutorials that work on your device and if you're on a regular sort of chrome or firefox modern browser on the desktop it'll show things that work there as the top kara soul okay okay thank you uh getting in the questions here locally i am speaking on the importance of teaching PP of science that children can hour of code help schools with an already prepared talk or slides so parents who aren't tech savvy to educate parents infinity yes he has actually available in this is that report sex yes you did resources right yeses yeah i should i'll share right now so so it's a great question and in fact this is not just for parents trying to educate their schools for teachers who won for example when one day we're encouraging you to do is host an assembly in your school where you can use and selling school to kick off our of code and encourage your students so if you go to resource kit go to presentations there are some presentations in here that you can download for example here we see if we pitch deck you can download and you can actually right now um and me may try to put some other ones up there as well this is this is really long that's harder to find on your own yeah well we should add to her okay there's a much better presentation we'll add it up there basically if you go to see i said we'd org under resource kit in the footer and presentations after get off this call will put another better presentation yeah we do it was to school stone yeah yeah so it's designed for trying to teachers or educators it's it's it's stopped yeah yeah doctors teachers yeah bet if we put on that CS teachers and it says these powerpoints yeah yeah just put that's hidden over there but we'll put it into the other resource good as well yeah ok ok and go back to our visitation ah ok to us next year what programming software will elementary schools use do you have an activity to recommend so we obviously we can recommend the tutorial that we've built a coded or tutorial as designed fella middle schools scratchers three the read recommends at scratch the code ahora one and tinker that all three of those are designed for elementary school students stinkers the schools well their hour of code initiative yes free for schools I'm not sure if the longer the longer thing I think it may have a free version our big version for beyond one hour certainly scratch is very popular Alice's popular kodu is popular and the new code or tutorials I believe it could be very popular yeah and we're going to have in addition to be one our list of tutorials will have a separate list which is for beyond one hour format in the same way it's not quite up yet all of the tabs from the absolute concedes it's not if you click the beyond one hour tab you don't see anything yet but those will be live certainly by the time our code to help you find them I guess so just to show any so much because excuse every org learn to beyond is not live yet but beyond one hour by time we go live with suicide week beyond an hour we'll have tutorials you can do to take you beyond the hour of code and to continue your CS education those will similarly have sections for beginners which pervasive design for elementary schools yeah and so another question here we started translating the tutorials well these wonderful tutorial apps to campaign ends absolutely so all the tutorials from hour of code will be continued to be available after CSF because over and in fact we're going to like I said we're we're thinking that after see I said with itself will just encourage that our code to live on and students can come try anytime they want on as far as editing improvement two translations later than that most of your life yeah okay that'll be continually evolving thing as well yeah okay disco dork focus on us only or is it a worldwide commitment to the clothes cause of coding knowledge at this one go for em we have two views on this everything that we developed it as marketing material or curriculum material we think of something that is of an international value and we want to be as much as we can to transit our tutorials translate our videos transito websites to other languages to enable everybody worldwide to benefit from oh the things that we're doing there are us only are the political advocacy work on after change laws in the states or the effort of professional development to effectively bring teachers up to speak to teach classes at those two are very local efforts they're both local and nature and expensive at to do worldwide so for those things we will do them in the US only but make the materials for them available for other organizations to be able to use worldwide so marketing curriculum worldwide advocacy and teacher professional development at us only and we already know that from the work we've already done even from the initial video and certainly the hour of code we know we're having worldwide impact even if it's not quite as deep as the impact would expect out in the United States thank you okay next question is doing to download an app the iPad you know if let me show this an ipad right here and you can go to the browser it's going safari the browser and the browser goes right to between the browser here going through the tutorials and you can see the satori here and this is actually running in the browser so no special app is needed that said if for some reason you don't have internet access because this does require internet access you don't have internet access but you want to even iPad there are applications you can download for the ipad such as tinker take your time as an ethical double or white spot and those are also listed the holistic controls yeah and again we will highlight those for you can go in ahead of time when you do have internet access download yacked your iPad or other tablet device and then offline use those tutorials but do but no specialist off is not needed next question you're very slow internet can we download tutorials in advance it going to depend the tutorial we've built the answer is no any available via the browser / continues effective internet connection but there are some software and app version whose can be downloaded in advance and I'll again you're all you can always use the paper and pencil exercises which required element access if there's a section in the tutorials list that is called apps that teach coding and those are things that you can download an advanced some of them are apps for the ipads and there are apps for android some of them are for pcs and desktops okay let's see we have here what program do we recommend two views or students would like to have them loaded ahead of time that is a scratch in game press they're going to be listed in the order that we recommend although we're basically reaching out to teachers to help us improve the recommendations to make sure we're sorting the different submission through the suit in proper order yeah but something recommended some of the recommended tutorials will be discreet a bill through web browser and don't require our preloading other is presently mythic scratch scratch I give them the modern version scratch scratch used to be a PC program you download scratch now i believe is dis equip site so and so the latest version scratch is simply hosted in a web browser assuming you have the web for beginners i'd recommend the code or tutorial or scratch and for people who already know some programming i'd recommend code Academy or contact me okay once again I wonder what is the tutorial website again it is CS ed week or CS org right now if you look under work work what's the hour of code it's at the bottom of the link yeah when that one code begins they'll be a big big red button saying start now yeah yeah that's a good point so totally cleared you go to CS Edwin org right now there's a special version of website designed for this kind of early rampup period during which time we're right we're preregistering people once we get to December ninth we will and NCS ed begins we will be switching over to a different version of the website that will look similar but it will you know the giant big button of the homepage will be start the hour of code so it will make it much much easier to start the hour of code and do the tutorials once we get to December night that we switch over to the call to live CSF website versus the one we have now which is about carrying and preregistering on so forth ok crushing is doing one do we want do we want you to use the tutorials from CS edu org or code Academy good calm you've been using code of canada calm so we don't care what tutorials you use we're looking for is for students to get expose the computer science it's already using code Academy and you haven't fed Academy that's fantastic that's great you're already way ahead of the game because it means you're already teaching your students computer science and that's wonderful the hour of code is really aimed at alternative um but we really aimed at those students and schools that don't currently have any computer science education and are and and therefore we're using this as an opportunity to kickstart and expose students for the first time to computer science and so the tutorials we're promoting are really leveraged at that very very first time experience and also for younger students if you've got students who are already been talked but academy that's fantastic I'm certainly not going to say you know don't do something to stop stop doing some oil anything else that's great can we do our own flash actionscript tutorials if you have the software again if you are comfortable yeah absolutely yes you're comfortable teaching your students how to developed I did kind of learn programming by using flash fabulous that's fantastic ah are all these tutorials going to be up after the week yes they will the tutorials available beyonce's education we get in the end here ah thank you notes thank you notes here's a question well any of the hour of code tutorials contain information on how to write actual code not just drag and drop the answer is yes for example code Academy has a series of tutorials on learning how to write JavaScript and business mothers then those those multiple carousels that first engineer ones at the next one right out there is going to be how to learn javascript yeah I'll show that again like I don't fit before but just to verify it so here are Zika carousel tutorials third one down two toes and shelter each one these tutorials right here is designed to teach actual coding so there's code combat there is you know code HS Khan Academy code Avengers code Academy and so forth pinochle okay that's question uh can we have students complete our own tutorials or do you have to use our resources of course any any computer science instruction counts for hour of code however the one thing I will say is if you're having students do your own tutorial and you're not starting the tutorial from our own website their participation won't count toward our overall numbers if students kind of globally doing the hour of code so we will have I don't know exactly how yet you will have a mechanism so the suit for teachers who are doing other offline tutorial susan paper pencil or the teachers who are doing their educators who are doing their own tutorials will have a mechanism for you to put a report your participation after the fact and that way we can both get those numbers into our system so they count toward the overall number of students worldwide who did the hour of code as well as will know that you did the hour of code so you're eligible for the dropbox account into the other prizes which you wouldn't otherwise be eligible for if it didn't know you did the hour of code so there will be mechanism to report your put your participation after the fact will the answer to these questions be in a written format after the check no we don't have any plans of doing a transcript although if any of you volunteers want to do that and you send it to it we'll post it yeah yeah but it does a good point so this this live webcast will be posted on YouTube is a video you can watch out for the fact anyone wants to go to the YouTube watch the video transcribe it and and send us that transcript will post it it's yeah youtube.com slash code or no period right okay that's our channel on YouTube okay uh can I repeat the programs for elementary school it'll be on the tutorial fit the tutorials page make it very clear which ones are great for elementary schools I was previewing the sites and they require a login or account to use a don't see tutorial page and a way to have a distorted view material without having to enroll it was different than we part of the event so that's your act so some of some of the tutorials do require a log on or account to use those soils will be pushed down to the bottom of the page come c s education week i'm not sure inaudible class today most the tutorials do not require any sort of log on in order to try using them and so you should be able to go to the tutorials page right now and try the tutorials as a teacher to preview them without having to do any sort of login and if you're having problems that you can post on our forums or email us help at code.org get further questions ok so this is even great by the way stuff I think it's all of you for so many great questions um here's a great question very important question I registered my whole school do my teachers need to register also in order to get their Dropbox prize absolutely if you have registered your whole school individual teachers still need to sign up on their own with their own personal email addresses in order to be eligible for dropbox anything that's a great question and again and again after the hour of code after suicide because over that's when teachers will be getting their drop out together we've heard a few teachers who are frustrated they designed of and have not yet gotten the dropbox account and that will happen after the output is over see there's a question about what we're going to do for kindergarten ok so what are we going to tell them from kindergarten there's a number of tablet apps or iPhone apps the one I recommend the highest is called light box which from age four and up they can do it if you don't have a smartphone the code or tutorials can be played by by kindergarteners they won't be very far any but it's still you know think if they can use a mouse or tablet like butter the code or two times we delta epsilonv my fouryearold daughter is going on so I okay we're gonna offer an open badges event we bought before we currently have no plans to offer an open badge although it has been brought up before maybe for the 20hour tutorial it would be suitable for that but i will so to hear a girl scout troop and you want to do the hour of code in your Girl Scout troop by all means you can create your own fun patch for the hour of code and make that available to your tier true let's see any questions here uh right the question is if I do the angry birds tutorial with 20 or 30 students or every student and his or her own pace or they better done in groups of two three or four our research actually shows that pair programming or programming with more than like the two or three students at a time in a small group takes a little bit longer it's a little slower but it's ultimately more effective and knowledge retention so if you actually would encourage there for students vrf code in pairs to students per computer if you if you can and that way and then and then that pair students can work there together and help each other to go through that's actually really fun way to do it it's also more social which is important for people with end of programming is just for good point although I yourself because I guess we should say our official different you heard it here first our official recommendation is that you do the tutorials in pairs of two and that because it's more social increased knowledge retention they're easier that are able to help each other get past obstacles they hit them and so forth you can also do it by the way if you're a younger classroom likes a kindergarten another way to do this is with the entire class together in front of a large projector or smart board where the teacher can be more easily facilitate and students shout out answers and have it be a very social activity also some of the unplugged activities the paper prints activities are also suitable for younger children a little bit more of scaffolding for the teacher what does the plan need to look like is it okay for it to just be a list of teachers and times or do you need a detailed account of activities this is a quota so teacher know you explain the background here so we have offered special prizes for schools that are offering the hour of code the entire school in fact is this repeated here we're making available a complete computer lab pursecase on every state inscription 50 states and every state we're going to pick one school that will receive a complete lab of three computers which is which is fantastic in order to qualify that though you have to do the hour of code for your whole school and you have to submit a plan showing how you're going to be the article for your your whole school that plan does not have to do to tenten's question elicit teachers and x is sufficient to qualify for logical plan for clinical this up ok I mean we're going to screen share here and show you where to find a sample plan to see said we've got org 10 / should just go to see a seventh ugh you said join us and then look down it tells you the base prizes and you want to see the details about the prizes it tells you need a logistics plan here's a sample plan so this is what a sample plan looks like which is for each sort of section of the day which key feature is offering this out of code to which students and how many students so times and teacher named the number of students is all we need you don't need to specify in advance activities because we know that you're trying to sort them out yourself great so that that's example of what a plan look like in order to qualify for the think of all that i should say you know this point is a number of schools of have submitted as you're completely that they are doing ed full school but some states you have better odds and others so i would encourage you let me quickly share with that be furious Dakota North Dakota especially you're in great shape I'll show you if you go to go back to the cs Edwin org page my favorite page in the entire site is is right here we have a running tally of who signed up so far as you can see right now we're up to 1.9 million students by eleven thousand six i'm going to organizers but you can actually see under whole schools here these are all of the schools who have said that their entire schools participating and so for example you know last week there was something well but for some schools in Arizona Arkansas uh California tough odds in California um Colorado Delaware only four schools in Delaware ah Florida's doing quite well Guam it was eligible but you could do this oh so you can you can go through here and really intestate one school and each state is gonna win a class that a lot laptops exactly so if you're in a small stood submit a plan right exactly okay um see is it okay if I make an Edmodo badge for students doing hour of code using the hour of code logo yep great that'd be fantastic if you do to that send email to help it put the rug and let us know about it oh just just post it on our Facebook page surfer if you use these computer science education week logo yeah rather than the code daughter logo because the hour of code really is about computer science education week but the Lord is organizing it this year and then pulling all the pieces together but 11 that's a very little is really about this this internationally celebrated you know in the United States congressionally recognized week called computer science education week yeah and that logo is actually more important to use but let's done this for that point cuz this is a really important I think a lot of people like the cook we're a very visible organizational now because we're helping organize a lot of the things but we really don't want this to become about code or we're just an organization trying to be computer science to every student in this country and around the world and it's not about us as novel co.org it's about amazing work you do animation with educators in this country and around the world are doing and ultimately about the students who choose to study computer science and so if you're going to you're going to promote anything promote CS education week which is a about you know pure science um if you want promote code this code is cool that's great but but we really don't want code it's not about us at code.org there's so many amazing organizations and educators and companies and tutorials in the world it's really not about us so with that said by all means going to create a badge to do so that's its great idea okay um is a good question if you're an experienced IT person how do you get plugged in to help it's a few things you can do one thing you can do if you haven't done already is good with our website co.org and there's a is a place where you can sign up on there as a silent addition as an engineer and then walk through is that fine so really cookies here we want to do so go to ok code.org and this is this is this is us in our capacities five clearinghouse you can go to this right here sign this petition and then once you've done that or enter that you're an engineer oh yeah once once you sign up as a soft engineer that puts you kind of an hour an hour list of potential volunteers we're not doing much with that yet but we do have plans to make that more available to educators in schools but more friendly um do wait for us I have two local if you're an experienced IT person you know get into your community and make sure that your local schools of your code they're having trouble trouble often a volunteer and going to help them you have a kid get in your kids classroom and work with their teacher to make sure they're teaching science in a school get involved in your school board to try promote make sure your full board is understands importance to the science in your community those are all important yeah we're five minutes left so let start to wrap things down is to see some of the other top questions here let's see me crunch I'm looking for a doubt looking for questions have not yet been answered some questions here are repeated and you've already answered there's a question says I've registered my school and I'm submitting was just it's fine do I need to do anything else the answer's no you don't need to do anything else will contact you asked after the fact we will pick the winners in each States and will email the 111 registered educator and everyone won the person who registered their whole school as an email will contact that email to say you want relations and then we'll post the list of winners so you can also who won most states and you follow yeah and there'll be some logistics obviously to confuse one you want suddenly get a truckload of computers a rocky one day they'll be some come back and forth um what's on here the 100 it did when are you going to exit push yourself the question says I'm in an online high school and the students have different hardware software we have a suggestion that is geared for high school students and can be done online as long as the computers are relatively modern meaning ie9 in an explorer 9 or above or Chrome or Firefox the browser's then either codecademy ver Khan Academy would work and if these students have zero experience than the code letter tutorials would work now the four primary suggestions I said are generally good go to one's the code Orioles scratch Khan Academy and build Academy and the read the way to choose between them is partly if you have an older browser go with scratch they have a new browser go with the other ones and then decide if they're experienced programmers go with the JavaScript ones chrome Academy black heaven let's grab your foot that work ok ok I think we're also ensures not to mention listening to get is critical to get through this second a lot of questions here for everyone that's great um why don't we go through the questions and answers on the form the first things you learn yeah that's that's fine ok so it's not that up dungeon grew out of time thank you once again to all of you for taking time to come in and do this Web cast will do this again at some point in the future so the maneuver opportunity ask more questions and I guess it's our big call to action is make sure you got your hour of code ready to go that you've reserved a computer lab or otherwise built set up your plan for how you're going to get in front of your students and beauty our code recruit others if you're in a school get other teachers including if you're in a community I get other organizations in the community approved if each one of you is hiding them to know if every one of you gets a single other educator to the RF code and we can double the number of our convention on the world we will hit our stretch goal of 10 million so that's that's going to be cute don't thank you thank you very much byebye
