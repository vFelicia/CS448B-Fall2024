usually a teacher will read that big math problem in the beginning of the lesson and think that their students aren't quite ready for it and it's true they're not quite ready that's why you need to take that big complicated problem and break it up into smaller pieces by giving them the power to do it on their own it'll teach them how capable they are of solving things that they would have otherwise thought are just too hard okay so has anybody ever had a problem that is so big that it seems like you cannot do it by yourself how about cleaning your room right has your mom ever told you to go in and clean your room and you're like oh yeah but what if your mom says hey go in and put your clothes in a pile does that seem so hard or go in and pick up your books is that so hard yes no sometimes i don't even read books but you can get to the exact same place doing little steps at a time right so that's what our lesson is going to be about today we're going to learn about computational thinking so to start out i'm going to ask you to add some numbers in your head you said you all know addition right okay here we go i want you to add the numbers from 1 to 200 in your head ready go you have 30 seconds add all the numbers from 1 to 200 in your head okay go okay is anybody done yet so how far did you get one plus 200 plus 199 plus 198 okay so not quite all the way was that such a big problem for any of you that you didn't even try no yeah so does anybody think they have the actual answer it was kind of a hard problem huh what we were doing is we were adding one plus two that's what we were trying to do right that's a lot to do in your head isn't it but what if i taught you a trick that helped you do it in your head so the first thing is add the numbers from 1 to 200 all in your head in 30 seconds great that's hard that's a big problem our first step was to take that big problem and break it down into little steps right and then the next thing we can do is we can look for patterns so does anybody see a pattern you guys both do what's the pattern so um um if you add like one plus 200 then you'll get on 201 and then if you keep going like two plus 199 you'll get 201 too and then if you have two plus if you have three plus 198 you get 201. does anybody see that pattern yeah so you have 201 201 201 how many of these are you going to have um make you've got two hundred and half which is one hundred and then multiply two hundred and one times one hundred can i just tell you that you guys all did that in your head right so what does that equal well thank you so you guys just took a big scary problem you broke it down you found a pattern you put it together into an algorithm that you could solve you did it all in your head and if you were to do this again it would only take you less than 30 seconds i guarantee you these are skills that you guys can actually use on every problem for the entire rest of your life and you're gonna notice if someone hands you a big problem and you go oh wait a week that's a big problem how can i break it up into smaller problems and then solve one at a time until i figure it all out you're going to be the smartest kids in your class you're going to be the smartest people at your workplace you're going to be the smartest bosses that ever ran a company because you'll be unstoppable so we're going to learn how to practice that okay so i'm going to show you how to do this okay so there's three different stories you need to go through the stories and wherever they have the same word in the same place you circle it and wherever the words are different you cross them out or underline them okay and then at the end we're going to write down all the things that are the same and wherever there was something different you're going to have a blank so you're kind of going to make your own almost a mad lib do you guys know what mad libs are yeah okay so go ahead and get started and i'll walk around and help you in case you get stuck there is an obvious pattern and teachers like to make sure that the kids pick up on it but it's enough for the kids to come up with their own thoughts based on the game so if this group comes up with a different game than this group it's perfectly okay just have them explain their reasoning and let them know where they succeeded or where they could use a little help so read it out loud to me i chose a blank and rolled a blank then a blank then a blink that means i need to draw a blank blank on my blank okay so now you have to figure out how to play the game based on what you just wrote so i chose a blank and they said lion donkey and puppy and so i can make them so what do you think is the first thing you need to do i chose a you can choose any of them you want okay so now you know your first step of your game okay and then i rolled a blank a blank and a blank so how many times do you think you have to roll the dice very good so now make up your own rules of the game based off of the instructions so now what we're going to do is we're going to think about the game that we just played you had a big problem you had to figure out how to make directions to this game and you needed to break it down into little bits which you did by having three different stories you had to find patterns and what were the things that were patterns what were those yeah right so there were some things that were the same in every story and you circled them right then we had to use abstraction which was taking out all the details because the things that were different we wanted to just ignore that until we were ready to create our own story so what did we do we crossed it out right and we made an underline there so we ended up with words and underlines that let us make our own story and that became our algorithm for creating rules to our game so this is what we do in computer science all the time we find big problems we pull them apart to see what things are the same and what things are different and then based on what we find out we can create a solution that works for everything
