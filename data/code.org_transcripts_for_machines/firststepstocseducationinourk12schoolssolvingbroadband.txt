we're going to give everyone about one more minute and we're going to go ahead and get started all right team let's go welcome everyone we are so excited about today i'm jacqueline smalls i'm the chief programs officer at code.org and i'm joining you from los angeles i'm on site at the global cs education conference and i'd first like to acknowledge the gabrielle eno tongva peoples as the traditional and caretakers of the tovangar los angeles basin so channel islands we also acknowledge that code.ourcode.org offices are based on the unseated traditional land of the coast salish peoples specifically in the first people of seattle the duwamish people original stewards of the land past and present we honor with gratitude the land itself and the duwamish tribe we know these acknowledgements do not mean much without action and partnership through this work however to support indigenous peoples we hope to build partnerships and actively support the students throughout the these indigenous communities welcome to the 2001 indigenous communities and k12 computer science education virtual summit i want to thank my colleagues sung kim jared fritz jess harrington and the code.org team for planning such an important convening in collaboration with natives in tech next slide please we excited to announce in partnership with the computer science teachers association and the expanding computing education pathways esp alliance the 2001 state computer science education report was just released yesterday these are some we have available hard copies if you'd like to have one please email sung at sung code.org to require our hard copy version we'd love to make sure that you receive one and next slide the latest data reveals that disparities still exist for who have access to computer science education the rapid growth in computer science courses offerings in the last few years is encouraging but despite the growth growth roughly half of all high schools still lack a single course given the significance of computing in today's society the work of the computer science education movement movement must continue in earnest next slide please and only 59 of native students attend a high school that offers foundational computer science or a school that offers foundational computer science and next slide although we've reached a milestone of more than half 51 percent of high schools offering cs only 20 percent of high schools are located on reservations and next slide so we have much work to do and that's why we're here today so again welcome to everyone here's our agenda for today as well as tomorrow and i'd just like to send a reminder that we have highly participatory workshops planned that require a lot of engagement and we want to be as interactive as possible so please consider joining us with your video on and have use of the chat but since we do not have tons of time to meet everyone during the first three sessions we are very much looking forward for you to attend tomorrow's one to two p.m community discussion and networking opportunity consider joining us um to meet some new colleagues and if you want to know more about what we are doing with code.org it's starting here today and we're so so excited we also going to start an infinity group so if you want we want to work with you so please email sung again at songcode.org to explore how we can support you and work together to make cs access more equitable for indigenous communities and with that i would love to introduce andrea delgado alston andrea is a citizen of the lone band of mywalk indians of the northern sierra foothills of california she is the executive director for natives in tech and the founder of native american women in computing and stem creating and cultivating opportunities for indigenous people in the technology industry andrea is actively involved in her community and serves as the chair of the election committee for the lone band of mohawk indians she is also a member of the aces board of directors chair of the aces professional development community committee cochair of the aces education committee and the chair of the birds of a feather committee for the center of minorities and people with disabilities in i.t andrea's greatest passion since switching from a career in teaching entering the technology tech industry has been creating equitable spaces and cultivating opportunities for indigenous people and the technology industry so without further ado i'd like to turn it over to andrea thanks jackie chin oh yeah andrea olsen connie look some iron band of miwok indians uh hello everyone my name is andrea um i am a member of the i own band of miwok indians and also the executive director at natives in tech and i do want to thank code.org for having me and partnering on this summit with natives in tech so with that i'll touch a little bit about a touch on my pathway finding my pathway into tech and really want to emphasize that you know growing up i didn't have access to computing um i will date myself a little bit but in high school and through elementary school you know we technology just wasn't available it was in the process of being um sorry built um so my career in um cs didn't start until i got into college um and it has been a winding road so go ahead next slide my experience started when i went back to school um university to get my bachelor's in education and i wound up taking a computer science class um for one of the required courses and just found a passion a passion for building the technology and all the things that it could potentially do for myself my tribe accessibility um the greatest thing that i wanted to accomplish was language preservation and just saw an adore opening for this opportunity to utilize technology to preserve language um go ahead next slide so i've had to navigate this space alone and i know that there are so many opportunities and pathways into different areas of tech and it was really important to me to highlight the people who are responsible for where i am today um i wouldn't have found the these opportunities if it weren't for these found these founding mentors um the first four doctor almadena conrad dr ellen spurtus dr susan wang doctor um and rose robinson have really set the stage for me um to find my passion in technology and to do the work to that really speaks to me and i think that's important now in early education and creating accessible opportunities for k through 12 cs education so that it doesn't come later in life where it's harder to navigate these spaces and they can learn the skills to find mentorship and opportunities to get involved and to build and to grow and thrive go ahead next slide so when i first got into tech um this was one of my passion projects you know i touched a little bit on language endangerment and what i wanted to do was build language preservation so rose robinson really eliminated a pathway for me and introduced me to some folks where they were looking to create a course for creating multiscreen apps and teaching how to build multiscreen apps for mobile development and they wanted to use language content and in the process i was building a language app for my tribe and for my dialect and so we collaborated i collaborated with google and udacity to build this course with them but also to build an app and scale out a language and language access to teach because there are only there is only one remaining native fluent language speaker in my tribe um at the time we had three we now um only have one so we are critically endangered of losing our language and this is just something that i am really passionate about and hope that i can see other um youth and future students of cs ed learning about and working on to make an impact in their communities go ahead next slide so with that um now is the time for change um there is just a surgeon of work surgeons of work being done you know i started out working on my language preservation but so many other people and indigenous communities are as well and this is where we just need more access more tools availability mentors visibility for our youth and for folks who are interested in getting into tech or just don't even know the opportunities that can come from it so i am here to be a support and a resource you know we talked about my volunteer opportunity my volunteer experience um with these organizations being at asus um i'm also on i'm on the board of directors as well as their community or sorry my education committee and i just love spreading the news about their education camps and opportunities for not only the students but for the educators as well um so with that go ahead next slide um i would like to share a little bit about how you can get involved or in contact with natives in tech our conference annual conference is starting tomorrow kicking off with a language workshop and that is by registration only you can find all of that information on all of our social media channels the conference itself open to the public is we'll be streaming live on our youtube channel on the 6th starting at 10 a.m pacific time and more information can be found on all of these links and if you just want to get in touch there's hello at nativesandtech.org so thank you um it has been my pleasure to speak with you about some of the opportunities in my experience next slide but it is a great honor for me to be able to introduce our keynote speaker and i will share her bio with you now um is the chief technology of director at the santa fe indian school since 2009 miss seekingwa has addressed regional broadband connectivity issues through the construction of middle mile networks by working with tribes to aggregate demand and harness local expertise to build tribally owned networks through covet 19 she assisted tribes to solve their connectivity issues through the construction of wireless residential networks currently she is leading a workforce capacity program for the pueblo to implement and maintain sustainable work networks in 2018 she worked with six tribes in new mexico to complete construction of two 60mile fiber optic networks bringing highspeed internet to rural underserved pueblos in 2019 fcc chairman ajit pai appointed her to the broadband deployment advisory committee lowincome working group also in 2019 she received the women in technology award by the native by the new mexico technology council in her early work she endeavored to build tribal capacity for and the next generation of native i.t professionals through a national science foundation i t experiences for students and teachers award that provided stem opportunities for native youth in 2016 she helped with a usda rus distance learning and telemedicine grant that connected 12 tribal libraries to the sfis distant learning center expanding native language classes and promoting language revitalization ms sikiya watiwa kwaktuwa is from the hopi tribe of arizona she is currently married in pochiti pueblo where she is a mother of three she holds an undergraduate degree from stanford university and is a woodrow wilson fellow with an mba from the university of new mexico welcome kimball it is so lovely to have you thank you so much andrea i appreciate it um good afternoon everybody my name is kimbo and going by kikimbo is just fine um i am from the whole beach tribe and and i'm coming today from kochiri pueblo new mexico where as mentioned i'm a mother of three and i've been in this community for about 20 years and i've also been at the center of indian school just about as as as long so for those of us in new mexico i'm very no i'm very much the new kid on the block but i'm happy and honored to be invited and thankful and appreciative that you are giving me your time today because i know how busy we are just a special shout out to those in new mexico on the call as well as all of the educators i know what we've all been going through through kovid and the fact that you are doing going above and beyond by participating in the precious moments of your day really speaks to the commitment to the topic and all the native educators out there you know double that with you know your pioneering efforts to help our communities participate um in the stem and steam um opportunities for our youth which are going to have critical longterm impacts and it's not going to be an overnight thing but i know that we're doing the right thing by focusing on this topic and in these conversations next slide please so the santa fe indian school we've existed in santa fe new mexico as an off reservation boarding school since 1890. we served the 19 pueblos of new mexico's and the navajo and apache tribes we're a high school in the middle school and we mainly serve pueblo students and twothirds of our students stay with us on campus five days a week we also have six bus lines coming in from three northern and three southern pueblos and then most students go home and for the weekend and that's obviously important for them to maintain their family and community connections despite the fact that they're with us in santa fe for for a majority of the week our school i mentioned was founded in 1890 it was a federal boarding school and i know we've heard about those in the news a lot and you know with respect to language and culture there were good times and there were bad times and those directly mirror federal indian policy you know the and what was going on at a policy level nationally not what was going on or should be going on with the best interests of natives and the education of our youth um in 1975 i believe it was the um there was a law that was enacted the um the selfdetermination indian selfdetermination and education assistance act and that enabled schools bureau of indian education or beer of indian affairs schools at that time to contract operations away from the federal government so what that means for us is that the 19 pueblos who were one of the first to contract under that federal law um our leaders our governors came together and were very intentional that they wanted to regain control over the future of pueblo people by taking control over the education of the youth so at that time our school went under tribal control and we became able to create the culturally responsive curriculum to look into our community for that expertise and to bring that into the classroom and to prioritize the topics that would create opportunities for our students and professional abilities that they could bring back into community to increase the community wellbeing so there wasn't a lot of technology back then obviously but there's always been a high degree of priority on language and as we just heard with others you know with andrea and her her example she's not alone you know native languages internationally globally are not in a very healthy state and we can talk about that at another time but in new mexico you know there's a lot of atrisk and endangered languages and when we as a school here from our tribal leadership they tell us that that is their top priority it's not always been that they wanted a school to solve that or to address the issue it's always better to speak at home in family in community but in the times we're in that's not always possible some tribes feel more comfortable using technology than others but again it's a tool that we have in our tool kit that if we harness we can use it to really solve some of our own community priorities such as language revitalization one of the challenges that we have in in the pueblo languages is that they're not written down they're only oral so when we're developing um you know you can't read and write in the book how can you facilitate the instruction well you can facilitate instruction great you know like we're doing right now on the screen so it's like what are the new opportunities we have when we think of technology in this space for realtime instruction and we know our students want it you can see from a student survey back in about 2015 that the overwhelming number of students want to speak their languages next slide please so the possibilities so this was taking those native language classes that had been happening in pueblo um in the summer time um more into a school setting and this is a recent trend in new mexico and recent being well i don't know about you guys but my sense of time has been all messed up during covid but at least in the last couple decades or so you know more of an acceptability to teach it in in the schools but teaching in community is different from teaching in schools the pedagogy is different and it needs to be developed so you have this effort to develop the curriculum so when we introduce technology into that conversation the two biggest possibilities for me was with multimedia and then with video conferencing so we have these black and white drawings of oral uh oral tradition that i know my kids used as they were learning their languages in the summer and and they were they're they're fine you know they're great and that they would come back every summer and get a little bit more um by the time you get to the senior you know high school there's been like a cycling of some of that content and the student engagement isn't as strong as with the younger students so that's kind of something that i think we wanted to address and so i was thinking i was like okay well what if we animate those black and white drawings why don't we tell the story and have them play the video that's going to do two things because the older students who are kind of um a little bit wearing uh you know tired of the repetitive content they can get engaged with the tech skills of creating the animations and increase their speaking and hearing of the language through that process and then the younger kids they inherit the content and they use they use that in their spongebob time where they're strengthening their language skills and then they're going to bring more language when they're older students and they're creating the content so what we i would like to believe is that we're going to see this spiral of language and digital digital literacy and media go together so that's my that was my longterm vision you know at that time and then you know the use of video conferencing no brainer you know if we can't write our language we can talk back to home community right here using zoom i mean it wasn't such a obvious solution you know when we had the great idea but it was it's clearly something that could be very powerful not just to connect to um a teacher or for a school you know when the zuni teacher calls in sick and you're in santa fe you can't easily find a replacement and then the students might watch a video during that classroom right well let's keep that instruction going by having that resource or that teacher available back in zuni or tribal leadership or a parent or an artist that can show you know the forming of you know something that they're making so bridging back to community through video conferencing is an amazing opportunity that we have in the native language instruction next slide please so this is the only problem our communities are too slow they didn't have internet we couldn't actually talk to them and the way that that was abruptly realized was that essentially when we solved the problem in santa fe so starting about 2008 2009 in downtown albuquerque santa fe the capital of new mexico you cannot get highspeed internet that was fiber optic based there were some ethernet circuits that were like 50 megs or something that were very expensive but we also struggled so that's when i really became engaged in the broadband community because i had to actually it was my job i was i.t director they're like bringing more internet so i'm out there you know scrounging for it and what i ended up doing is meeting the community the wide area network community um the broadband community whoever you like to call it and bringing in a highspeed circuit into new mexico i mean into santa fe and the school and then we turned around to the communities and said hey we have this internet we're super fast let's do this awesome stuff with it and there was just violence and like i said they were too slow to talk back and there's there's reasons for that and anybody out there in rural in urban in an urban desert will know that you don't have choices that are fast or affordable and that's because the market the carriers haven't built out their networks to provide us with those choices and that's just the reason that we're under connected um and on where we're starting from next slide please so we have some momentum going with the use of technology and then like everybody else covid you know just um just eradicates the any previous memory all we're doing now is kobit we're going into remote learning i think we went into remote learning on march maybe 20th of 2020 i went into a director's meeting we were going in for a long going out for a long weekend there was a student that was going to fly out of state and we're like should we allow that student back in to school you know that's a kind of a high risk situation with the transmission of the virus and an hour later we closed school indefinitely so we packed them up we found all the chromebooks that we had in stock and sent them home for what we would then realize was the rest of of the school year um like many schools we um needed to assess you know their level of connectivity um and so we conducted a survey and that was really very informative to not just get us through coven but really tell us where we were in indian country and what options we had to connect our students in home so rural indian lands are the least connected in the country that's just a known fact the fcc reports that you know year after year they say there's improvements and there are but probably not quite to the amount that are reported right now because of certain data and reporting issues but as i mentioned we're we serve tribes statewide so when we send our kids home we sent them to 22 rural tribal lands so therefore they have to be some of the least connected places in america and solving for each one was unique they don't all have the same solution because they don't have the same options they don't have the same geography the same mountains and valleys and mesas that we gotta work around so that was our focus going into covid um we had to get obviously um very creative um what we found out though in this survey and note to self if you're going to administer an internet survey on lack of connectivity do not do it over the internet um we called everybody and we've we paid our staff to find each and every santa fe indian school family to find out what what their internet's connectivity status was and what we found was that 89 of them did not have adequate internet that met the fcc's performance benchmark of 25 megabits down and three megabits up to um facilitate this video conferencing experience we have now um adequately that meant that and and i and only 23 of our staff did right uh nonetheless we know that our students um persevere and they will find the internet when they want the internet and we found that precovet how they were doing that was prepaid um phone plans you know you when a family had disposable income you could go and buy you know a number of them at best buy or walmart and then they would have the internet for you know one to three months and then their phone number would change too which is frustrating and then it would go away it's very expensive very data caps but it was it's very common um and i that's not a surprise i'm sure many people on the phone 27 percent percent of them were using public wifi that means they were going to town mcdonald's um starbucks 21 were using their tribal libraries these are critical facilities in our communities and when the homes didn't have internet and when those homes didn't even really have computers the students were going to the libraries after school or they would go to relatives homes or or work so that was that was fine or that was again the way it was and we were getting by so on the other hand enter covet again or and we know that only 11 of our students can connect we were already the least connected in the united states we need the internet more than ever and all those internet lifelines were just cut off because what our tribal leadership did and what they needed to do and what we i thank them every day for doing is constructing checkpoints which prevented people from entering and leaving the pueblo nations and really many most of the tribal nations through covet but what that meant was is they couldn't go to the tribal library those closed um many left the parking lot wifi on which was great but then there were social gathering rules that maybe prevented them from actually going to the parking lot they could no longer leave the pueblo to go to mcdonald's or starbucks um the bus i spent most like three months working with a national nonprofit called itdrc in our state public education department installing hundreds of public wifi locations across all of new mexico tribal lands and those are great except that when you have bus wifi and you don't have a tent in the shade and you're under the sun in the desert that's not a great learning environment and so they were a necessary tool at the time but they weren't they weren't the longterm solution and then we had the lack of um you know income because of the the closing of jobs and the families who were artists who couldn't go to the shows um really not being able to have any disposable income to buy the the cellular you know the the um prepaid card that may or may not work because the cellular coverage may or may not have been great across your tribal land so with your back up against the wall and all your options just disappearing in front of you you get pretty brave next slide please you come to the realization that you have to do it yourself so you look around the room and you're like okay who's doing it with me and you're like how do how do we figure this and i think that one of the reasons we were able to be that brave is because of some more call share later is that we had just put in those fiber optic networks so we had already got our hands a little bit dirty um and what we knew more than anything is that we had to in short order for remote learning provide provide our students and families this this beautiful magical world of floating blue orbs that connect us far and near to do our work to give us entertainment to give us ideas to connect with the global information age so how exactly do you do that next slide please you when you build it yourself you deal with a lot of dirt this is the internet this is all that's behind like the magic and it's so not magical um they're big projects you do it you know one step at a time but essentially that's conduit that's fiber optic conduit and those are plows so it scratches a hole a line in the ground as least invasive as possibly you pull in the conduit you pull in the cable and you plug it in and this is what we spent from 2018 doing not anticipating the pandemic but trying to solve our connectivity issues because i told you where we were starting um the pueblo of cochiti when we started had that 25 of one phone so while this seems dramatic to do it was very it was the best choice that we had and once you figure out kind of the um the the project management pieces from the funding to the permitting to the construction which is that fastest part to the lighting up you see that it's doable it did take us about three years to put in these 260 mile networks and it was a group of us it wasn't it was me from the santa fe indian school as the erate person we used the fcc erate project each one was about four million dollars but we got a 95 federal subsidy and then the consortium members divided that last amount across um across the group so each library paid about sixty thousand dollars which then was reimbursed by the state so essentially for the the libraries themselves and the schools in these part in these projects it was free we met every thursday as a group of librarians education directors myself tribal administrators and then other people that came in and out depending on what project phase we were in and at one at no time did anybody know everything there would be times where we were at a part where none of us had that experience um and we just went and found it or when it was time to do a permitting and somebody's like okay i i know how to do that through you know my job and so we pieced it together from a collective and i think that's the strength that we have and um that we discovered that we didn't know was the strength that we were coming from community providing our own community solution and we were solving it from from within um by the way when we were meeting at all those libraries every thursday for those three years they were sleepy you know we'd have the whole place to ourselves their small oneroom libraries anyway but then once we flipped the switch and turned the internet on we would go back to those same libraries and the all the computers would be full there would be people milling around the bookshelves and there was just a vitality and a life at some point we realized we were doing more than just um trying to find cheap fight um cheap fast internet original goal was wasn't community transformation but that is exactly what we accomplished and what was revealed by bringing the connectivity to these to these stripes next slide please so the way that in in broadband and i'm going to back up now because it's this is the the middle mile is the beginning of the story but it really just set us up for the covid our code solutions was to just explain a little bit about broadband infrastructure so the first vocabulary we use is the middle mile and that's the cochiti center amigo san felipe santa ana bernalillo to the albuquerque and that's regional that's state to state county to county tribal ant tribal land and that's where you put in the big trunks and they provide the transport to the small communities and that's the last smile and when you're doing last mile services that's to home or to business um directly so they the last mile in the middle mile work together middle miles oh fiber is king you always want fiber optics and you those are going to be multiyear millions of dollar projects as i just previously described the last mile you can do fiber to the home or you can you can do wireless you have some price points there um and those will go up faster and they're going to be cheaper they're not going to always be as fast and as long term as your fiber to the home networks however that is what we needed to do in kovitz so when with our backup against the wall when we knew we had to bring the internet into homes not just a community and we had no choices what we did is last mile wireless and it's those tribes that had the middle mile already figured out and in place that within months we're able to provide up to 100 residential coverage to get us through remote learning so i'm proud to say that we had at least four of the pueblos um be able to have um internet's residential services that by christmas and one of our largest most traditional pueblos actually had all the homes connected before the first day of school um another thing and why i wanted to pause on this and point out is the tri the fcc tribal priority window that happened last year is that this was the first time ever opportunity by the fcc for the tribes to gain control of the airways above us unlike our other natural resources such as water we don't have any control over the air space above us which transmit these wireless frequencies um and deliver the deliver the internet among other things and this is because we just don't it's just kind of something that the fcc's claimed they've sliced and diced it and sold and leased it above us we could be a um a bitter maybe on some of these auctions in the past but the the entry level to participate in these auctions is not only expensive requires attorneys in an extreme level of um just an effort that's beyond the reasonable expectations of you know of our tribal nations but what chairman pai did and i really appreciate him for this is he there's a spectrum called the 2.5 gigahertz band it's the anybody doing 5g the carriers are all over it it's a great midrange spectrum it goes through trees it goes through walls and everybody's going to want it it's going to go out to auction very shortly before it goes out to auction he gave rural tribes the opportunity to license it before that so what this is in the sense of tribal sovereignty is this is us being able to claim the airspace above us and um not all the tribes are eligible because there had to be some unlicensed 2.5 above you but um over 400 tribes did apply of um you know the 570 580 number of um tribes in the united states and largely were successful so we're gonna see in the future that these tribes now have the expectation to build and utilize these wire uh these wireless networks so this is like a new beginning and a new birth nationwide for our tribes to participate in telecommunications as as carriers as providers as an operator not as a customer so in terms of tribal selfdetermined determination and capacity building it's a really exciting and powerful time for our tribal communities next slide please so at that after all that after we had the great idea realized there were like some barriers to the great idea made it through coven provided inhome residential access you know we get back to the curriculum we get back to what we started to do at the very beginning and i had i had taken this picture or used our um with one of our tribal communities you know through covid um in in talking about our experience and i just saw it the other day and then it just really pulled it all together because you see a native language teacher talking over meets resume and have my glasses on with another instructor and then a student in home using the tablets and this image just is like the perfect synopsis of all these efforts because for this picture to happen for the in that library to have the internet that's that middle mile work that's the work since 2015. um through the covit experience those laptops that they're using and the fact that the student has internet connectivity her last mile connectivity is what provided her to be able to be on that screen that usda distance learning and telehealth grant bought the equipment the video conferencing equipment for the library and it comes together perfectly to do what we had asked it to do in the in that in that vision and although that seems like a lot of effort for one interaction with one student you know we replicated this um i think it was the 16 actually tribal libraries who got the equipment and you know putting in that middle mile infrastructure um 11 of 19 and with the recent federal funding you know we could be pretty darn close to the all of the 19 pueblos in new mexico having the middle mile i didn't focus it on the other slide but at least 11 of the pueblos and now more again with all the federal funding and planning coming in are delivering wireless or fiber to the home solutions so we have the infrastructure in place increasingly there's always you know work to be done but a lion's share significant progress is made to do to have a systematic statewide tribal solution next slide um and what that is going to do so we we have this connectivity and equally as important as that is we're connected to each other we're connected as tribes and we're connected as educational stakeholders whether we're libraries whether we're public schools bie schools charter schools head starts or higher ed and what we can do with that in education is something that indian education has never participated in before and were that is connecting us to um higher education in new ways that um for instance when i designed these networks these middle mile networks we connected to albuquerque and our network facility is in a room in a carrier hotel with all the other carriers carriers of carriers in what's called the albuquerque gigapop that's a higher ed regional network that connects all of the new mexico universities and colleges together so now we have a tribal library in cochiti pueblo and we're connected not just to unm the university of new mexico we're connected to every university in new mexico think about the potential for distance learning and dual enrollment there the albuquerque giga pop is a research and education network nationally is connected with internet too so now we're have access to advanced compute research opportunities in high performance computing big data things that we've never done from our from our home communities and that now we have to figure out how to leverage i i know it's cool i just don't know what to do with it yet i don't know how to drive it yet and that's what i'm hoping you will tell me quite honestly but but we're here it's it's a new paradigm and we we're putting in the infrastructure that not just this generation the next generation are going to leverage and i i and maybe you guys someone out there knows that i saw some sort of statistics the other day that was saying that 60 of the generation that we're in their their jobs their future jobs haven't even been defined yet but it's gonna be technology rich it's gonna be utilizing this infrastructure and now our tribes and our students have the opportunity to participate in those in that space just like the peers that are in town that are connected so it's an equalizer and i'm really excited that we've done as much as we can although there's still much more to be done i invite you all into the space and conversation to join in because while we're working on the infrastructure and making grounds it's just the thing now we need the programmatic pieces we need the people side to use the tool for the better to meet all those community goals so again i thank you for for your time today and for the invitation and i hope this is just this beginning of a long conversation and that we can get to those to those next steps and those awesome people and smiley faces and healthy community vision that i think we all have if we're here today so thank you okay we are going to turn it over for q a if there's anyone that has a question and or comment please we'd like for you to either come off mute and or type into the chat we'd love to hear your feedback or any comments that you may have kimball thank you thank you i while we're while we're waiting on folks here um just had a couple of questions um we only have a couple minutes for questions so if you do want to ask kimble anything make sure to share um but one question um of all the lessons learned in your experience developing this developing broadband and being able to make that connection happen what is like your top lesson learned that you you want to make sure that the folks here kind of know about or or can can can walk away with you can't do it yourself there's just no way no one school no one entity can really can really provide the the full solution and to work together like we all sit like i don't know in the tribal lands or in any of your communities if you're experiencing it next to your neighbor who's suffering or next to your um the health clinic next door and everybody's trying to solve it themselves so they're having the same problem and they're just not talking about it so just creating that communication vehicle because people also have access to different resources and so some of them might be the last last mile some of it might be middle mile somebody might have used their end user pieces but all together it'll start chipping away because there's the infrastructure piece and then there's um for institutions i talked about the programming but affordability is a huge um piece of the puzzle because you can put in the most expensive beautiful thing in the world but if people can't afford it then it's for naught so um just as a side note that you have to um there there are federal programs right now there are a lot of shortterm bandaids out there but i think when we set um also in this this space which is participating in the in telecommunications we can set those price points so we know it's affordable to our tribal members and then we can also sell to our neighboring communities where we need to make some return on investment and some network sustainability you know some income but we can first serve our community needs as a as just a human rights right a priority campbell was is there anything that you would have done differently based on those lessons learned like thinking back you know hindsight is already always 20 20. is there anything that you would have done differently um that's a good one uh staffing i think i would have got myself some more help i raised my hand and said you know can you know this is a little bit big of a lift for a core group um but where one place then that gets overlooked well two i think that with being short staffed if we had shared our successes more i think we could have given i think other communities could more quickly and more and the second piece is advocacy oh my gosh um the federal advocacy is just so important it's when the fcc opens an order in a comment period you know send the letter um you know there or send the letter to your congressional delegation because there are advocates out there and if they hear your example you're a real life example because that's what they're starved for right they can write legislation but they need to hear it from the firsthand experience to carry those stories forward with them to make the case for the dollars for you so i think upping the advocacy and upping some of the information sharing would have mobilized kind of the effort in a little bit stronger and faster thank you thank you so much for the journey the story that you shared it was inspiring i think so many of us are saying absolutely wow of all that you've accomplished if you look in the chat you will see that we are just truly amazed and inspired um andrea thank you for joining us and partnering with us to make sure that this conversation is happening and kimball again thank you for your inspiring stories hopefully this is
