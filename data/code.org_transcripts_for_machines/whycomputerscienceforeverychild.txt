as a 4yearold had to live through a Islamic revolution totalitarian regime war with Iraq and bombings every night in our city so not a great childhood probably the most important thing that happened to me in my childhood was when my dad bought myself and my twin brother our first computer he didn't bring us any soft or any games and we were in Iran so he couldn't buy any of that stuff so I learned how to basically program the computer from the manual because I knew how to do computer programming I ended up getting the chance to build Internet Explorer which is used by billions of people had the chance to invest in Dropbox on Facebook these things made a major difference in my life the Delta between jobs and students is roughly 100,000 jobs a year more jobs than students studing computer science over 10 years that adds up to 1 million jobs and if you add up the salaries it's over half a trillion that basically our industry wants to pay to these graduates the graduates don't exist our population needs to be ready for the 21st century and the vast majority of our schools don't even teach this skill this is a field that leads to the best paying jobs in the country it is the degree that if you graduate with you have the highest chance of of graduating with a job and the highest salary possible code.org started out as a hobby for me I wanted to make a short movie that combines some of the smartest most famous Geeks of the world along with regular World celebrities talking about the importance of learning computer science and how it can change your life and how it's important for our world this video resonated with millions of people it struck a real cord and the response was so overwhelming that my hobbies now turned into a fulltime job for code.org success is about two things every school in the United States teaches computer science and every single student gets some exposure to it we should be able to add trillions of dollars to the economy millions of jobs as well as helping reduce the inequality Gap by allowing the underprivileged kids to have a pathway to the best jobs in the country and it's not just about the jobs you can get or the salaries it's about learning that if you build something you have a dream you can spread that dream to other people and it changes the world oh
