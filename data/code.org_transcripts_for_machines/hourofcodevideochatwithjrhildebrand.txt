one and thank you for joining us today for a special arab code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week joining us today is jr. hildebrand jr. is an American race car driver that's passionate about technology and computer programming students please join me yeah hey guys I'm excited to be here we're gonna talk a little bit about racing you guys you guys already you know put together some good questions so we're excited to be about it I trust that you guys have all done your hour of code already I know that I have so yeah let's get this party started right well our first question is from Monrovia Middle School in Madison Alabama how is computer science impacted the world of racing computer science is a huge piece of what we do because we collect an incredible amount of data from the race car so the race car goes out on track it has a data box that's connected to it and we collect thousands of different types of different types of data points sampled hundreds of times per second so those of you that are familiar with the size of data and all that kind of stuff we collect almost a gigabyte of data per lap at the racetrack so that's a lot of information that we have to be able to go through and the engineers that work for our teams there's probably five or six fulltime engineers that work per car per race team so you figure there's maybe 25 or 30 cars that compete in an IndyCar event at a time you know that's five guys per team and then there's a bunch of engineers that work for the engine manufacturers and all kinds of stuff there's hundreds of engineers that work just within one single series like India or NASCAR or Formula One or whatever and then they have to go build programs to be able to analyze is that data so the computer science element of it is a huge piece of what we do with the racetrack it's a huge piece of how we solve problems and that we do that in a very similar process to how you guys might say look at a science fair project or something like that we have to come up with a hypothesis for what we think is going to happen on the track then we collect the data from the race car we look at that data through our computer software that's all shown in sort of a graphical display much like what you guys would look at while doing the hour of code and then from there we decide to make some adjustments or make changes of the car and go back out and do it all over again so the computer science element of what we do is you know we wouldn't be able to go 230 miles an hour at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway if computer science wasn't as big of an element of how we go fast and how we compete at the track great thank you and our next question comes from me diabolos middle school in media palace Iowa why did you decide to become an advocate for computer science and encouraged students to learn how to code yeah that's a good question I think for me it's just it's such a big piece of what we do you know in in Motorsports we see math and science generally at work in a very real sense every day at the track physics chemistry we're running algorithms constantly to try to figure out how to sort through the different amounts of it or the you know the different type of information that we have and so and I think that that that will only become a bigger and bigger part of a lot of industries that are out there and that frankly they're really cool industries and you look at the space the you know sort of privatized spaceflight and things like that you know computer science is going and that's what's gonna drive those fields and so I think it's important for guys like you you know for for young people like yourselves to see that not only is that a very viable career path down the road but it's a career path that can lead to being involved in things that are totally cutting edge and really cool and fun to be a part of you know getting a computer science degree you'll have sort of limitless boundaries for what you'll be able to do with that I think in five or ten years so it's important I think for you know generally in math and science but definitely in computer science to see that there's really cool stuff that you can do with a computer science degree out there great thank you and our next question comes from Decorah High School in Decorah Iowa what motivated you to do so well in school while pursuing a racing career our job security is pretty lousy in Motorhead Sports kind of generally but I think for me that was just you know when I was growing up I was really focused on my education you know I liked racing and I liked cars and you know I played oh there like I played varsity baseball in high school and maybe kind of other normal stuff you know my education was just always I looked at that as a foundation from which I'd always be able to you know have success from and and I'd say since I've it was sort of fortunate enough to pursue a professional career in sports that focus on education has only helped me further my career doing this so not only is it something that's given me a great platform to work for him should I decide at some point to do something else but it's allowed me to be more successful in doing what I do especially with you know what we do at the racetrack you need to be able to communicate with you know guys that have their PhD in you know you know various physics fields and engineering fields and things like that so you know having that focus and that background for me in education has made having some kind of common vocabulary and you know the ability to discuss things on their level with those guys technically much more straightforward so you know I think it was something that was kind of ingrained in me from look from when I was a little kid to to pursue having success in education but you know it's also ended up being something that I've gone back to and and continued taking some classes here and there and things like that just because I've realized that it helps me even in my profession now great thank you so our next question comes from Acadia junior high in Winnipeg Canada what's your favorite app or game and that's a tough one you know I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that racing games were high on my list but I always kind of liked like puzzle like logic games ideas like maybe more of like a stupid adult thing but like I do that Lumosity do you guys see commercials for online but it's like a bunch of logic games or brain teasers and all that kind of stuff I like stuff that kind of keeps you sharp it makes you work for it but you know having said that there's a bunch of there's a bunch of apps and games that I did have you guys played that 2048 is one that I've gotten addicted to four times two dots there's a few of them I get I get hooked on are pretty easy so eight I'm sorry next question comes from McKinney High School in McKinney Texas jr. if you could have one piece of technology that doesn't exist yet what would it be I don't know you know like I had this guy's wrote this question to me earlier and like I still don't really have a good answer for it you guys have any good ideas let's hear some from the class here you crazy go ahead and unmute yeah yeah okay teleportation teleportation yeah I mean certainly if you look at kind of like global scale yeah you know water purification and things like that are definitely you know we we like to think of those as being like more humanitarian obviously and maybe a little bit less fun I don't know I'd have to I have to think about that a little bit more that's a super good question that was a that was a hard one you know for us I mean I've always been huge on space travel so I think like warp drive stuff like that is it was definitely something that I hope and in our lifetimes that we see some development in you know I don't know yeah that's that's an awesome question good job guys great sorry next question is from hot gap middle school in John's Island South Carolina like like anybody there's a lot of obstacles that you have to overcome I think in any in any pursuit whether that's you know sports or a career path or through your education you know a big piece of it for us you know in in racing you know there's such kind of a small there's a very short list of drivers boys and girls that are capable of you know that really have the skill set to do what we do at I level and win races so you're kind of always up against you know other people's perception of how good you are at different things you know we in racing you're always a part of a team and sometimes that's sometimes that helps your personal performance you know sometimes you can kind of over achieve because the people around you are really good sometimes you you know your results kind of seem to be underachieving because of the people around you and that that's you know that's something that you kind of have to learn to accept about life you know like there are always variables that impact how well you do with things and what other people think about it and so I think for me and for a lot of guys or you know men and women you know Danica Patrick is is someone who's dealt with this you know because she's a female in in bigger ways than most or more frequently than most is you know having to at some point come to the realization that you need to just trust trust yourself and trust your own feelings about your ability to do things you know there's there's a difference between being impatient and being unprepared you know when you're coming into something new or you're trying to kind of climb up the the ladder within you know whatever you're doing is you're going from grade to grade or you know maybe you're gonna start taking some honors or AP classes you know for us you start out racing like little race cars then you get into something faster and faster and faster and then you're on TV and people are paying attention and you know all of a sudden you're trying to you know kind of find it out with the rest of the the hotshot guys that have been doing it and been pro for a long time you know so having to kind of overcome you know all of the other people's opinions about you know how well you can do and how far you can go can be a very if you can achieve that can be a very liberating kind of experience personally you know to to really have that faith in yourself and and know that that matters more than more than anything so I'd say you know particularly in what we do that's a big piece of it great and our last question comes from massage middle school and Asajj Beach Missouri we read that you're accepted to MIT but decided to pursue racing career do you believe that you'll pursue programming in the future yeah I think so it's a you know programming specifically as a part of what is obviously like a much larger you know to me I look at that as a piece of maybe a larger engineering focus that that I already have and I think will continue to have you know I've maintained a strong relationship with MIT you know thankfully for all my you know my parents and high school counselors and stuff not going to call it not going there right out of high school has sort of panned out that I've actually managed to become a professional racecar driver but you know it's definitely a part of what I'm interested in now it's a big piece of what I do as a profession as it is despite the fact that I'm the the guy driving the car and not the one working on it so you know absolutely I mean I I fully intend to get my get my degree and that programming will will absolutely be a piece of that great well thank you jr. for joining us today we so appreciate you spending time answering questions and sharing more with us and inspiring more students to try computer science well students can everyone join me in thanking jr. for his time today
