Congratulations! You've learned to use computer science commands to bring the Minecraft world to life. You are the developer now. You've unlocked all the commands and all the creatures. You choose what happens. What do you want it to do? Okay, so we want it go and "when night" explode! We're not going to collect ore we're going to collect sand! Forever drop... (singing) lemons and potatoes! Chicken bock! When spawn, explode. I love zombies! We get to do more stuff. More stuff happens! When you're done making your game, choose share to get a link that you can share with your friends or to play your game on your phone. Have fun! I'm looking forward to playing your version of Minecraft.
