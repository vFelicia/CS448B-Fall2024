my name is jordan and i'm lakota in nez perce i'm also hopi in mojave and i lead a team called global outsourcing at pinterest you know we're we're storytelling people we're creative people we're a thriving people so much of that natural you know tradition and culture that we carry has a lot of overlap into the work that people are doing in the tech industry and so you know being from an indigenous community and working in the tech industry is is a great intersection because so much of what you authentically might bring as an indigenous person is exactly what people are hoping to find you know in the work that we do so i think it's a it's a great place to be i think that there's there's a natural bridge for our community and i hope that more indigenous people find a path into the tech industry
