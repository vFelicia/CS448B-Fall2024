hi my name is soraya buhanda and i'm a professional learning specialist with code.org i want to thank all the classrooms tuning in for today's my journeys class chat teachers please know we have enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats i'd like to welcome danny bazzo a creative engineer at meow wolf where he helps to build super cool interactive art i'm excited to talk with danny because i've been to meow wolf both as a parent with my family and as a teacher with my students on a field trip danny is going to share with us his journey from robotics to electronic music to game design that eventually led him to where he is now teachers please know let us know where your classes from and add your students questions for danny in the q a we'll try our best to get to some of those questions during the chat today so danny let's start with a would you rather question the question is would you rather be forced to sing along or dance to every single song you hear i'll go first i think i would rather have to dance to every single song i hear to kind of work it out through dance instead of forced to sing the songs what would you rather danny uh that's a hard one i'm a terrible dancer but i could fake my way through with a little operatic through pretty much anything everything nice all right let's dive right in so what is meow wolf and where does its name come from ah okay so um i'll share some pictures with you here and we'll talk about that um meow wolf is a group of artists who make what are called immersive interactive installations and that's a lot of words to mean a place where a story is sort of happening and i'll start by answering your second question where what does meow wolf mean where did it come from well it's a group of artists and they couldn't agree on the name a long time ago so what did they do they threw random words into a hat and agreed that whatever first two words they picked out of the hat would be the name of the group and that's how we became mao wolfe a long time ago and so what is meow wolf well i'll show you a video about one of our stories um from our installation in las vegas and this is a story in las vegas about a grocery store uh with maybe a twist so meowth is a place where a story is happening and by interacting with um a big almost sort of movie set um you take part in the story too that is so awesome before we go on jenny i do want to acknowledge some of the classrooms so we have san diego elk grove california thurman middle school in frederick maryland north dakota 4th graders from carson city nevada a csd class from sacramento california and one class that did respond to the would you rather half the class would like to sing and half of the class would like to dance so now danny what does a creative engineer do oh well that's a good question so um i'll show you some pictures about that too about what we do at meow wolf so um some of our places in the installations have interactive things like this for example on the left is a huge skeleton that you could play like a xylophone you hit it with a mallet and each rib makes a different noise and makes a different sound happen um on the right is a set of mushrooms in the forest where if you sort of bop them they make a different sound and play some lighting animation as well so i work on the team that is behind the scenes for those kinds of elements doing the wiring the code and the electronics that makes all that interactive stuff uh happen really cool also quick shout out to those uh students in pittsburgh pennsylvania so how did you decide to become a creative engineer well um i've always had an interest in art and in making things whether it's electronics or whether it's code or mechanical stuff when i was young i played with legos basically all day especially the technic legos that allowed you to use gears and mechanisms i did that all the time but i also was kind of drawing and painting and trying to figure out a way to put all this stuff together um when i was young the creative engineering at meow sort of didn't exist and the next closest thing was like movie special effects i love movie special effects so i thought i would be a movie special effects person um and in fact uh if you want to hear about the training that i did i could show you some pictures that kind of led me along this this path here yeah sure oops oh yeah i left out some of the uh other things that we do as creative engineers is write a lot of code and some some of you who code yourselves might recognize on the left the processing language uh that we use a lot at now so um i got my start oops um going through school so here's some robots that i worked at worked on through the various schools that i've gone to on the left is a is a underwater robot that i worked at shout out to san diego at san diego community college on the right here is some roombas that i programmed with uh that that i programmed to do some uh chase games with and on the middle here is a set of robotic cameras let me see if i could find a picture of one that i worked with at university so most of my training was done through school i ended up going to school for uh engineering and robotics that's so cool so walk us through your thought process for thinking about and creating art from devices and electronics well um to me as an electronic artist um i treat circuits and code almost like my paint brushes when i have an idea for a creative work or at meowth when someone else has an idea for creative work i think of ways to make that happen using the paint brushes and tools that i have so what kind of circuits would help me do what people want what kind of sensors or what kind of motors and actuators would help us get the animations we want um so i started there with the creative idea and kind of worked my way over into what technology would work best cool so what other i know you've mentioned already some of your cs skills that you've or programs that you've done but what other cs skills did you learn and what do you use today in your work uh well along the way um since my background is in robotics use a lot of math so i i've done a lot of um well calculus and a lot of matrix algebra and for coding um we use a few languages one of them as i mentioned is called processing another one is called max other ones are called touch designer and a lot of these are free and in fact easy for young folks to just pick up and start to learn um processing for example has a huge community where you could ask questions and get feedback for how to do projects that you wanted to do that's so cool do you have any examples you'd like to share with us of other work you've done sure i've got an example of what um one project i did at mail see if i can navigate up to it this was uh a project for our dark ride this is a slow roller coaster ride in denver where we have an animated character out front who tells the story that you're sort of about to see in the ride so as we began programming the character i had to come up with a creative way to program these characters movements um using my own body and so what i'm going to show you is a video here's our little robot and there's me and what we do is we've got a camera on me and some software that i've written translating my movements right over to the robot and the robot can't move the same way i can with all these different joints it only has a few different movements but i was able using the computer science that i know to sort of translate my movements over to this robot and animate the character at the front of our we ride and how long does a project like that take that that one probably took like a month or so of uh of dedicated work for myself and a big team i pretty much never work alone on projects once you get to complicated projects it's all teamwork and uh i work on teams of you know maybe up to a dozen or more people if the project's big and sometimes just uh three or four people but a project like that took many people and a few months do you also share um like the coding project as well uh yes in fact sometimes um we sort of choose based on skills so if someone is better in robotics and someone is better in video we kind of split up who does what or also if someone wants to learn a new thing we're always eager to say if you want to pick this up why don't you try the robotics this time and i want to give a quick reminder to everyone tuning in please put your questions for danny and about all of his awesome work that he's doing with meow wolf um into the q a so danny where do you think your curiosity stemmed from well like i said i've kind of always been into um well taking things apart when i was little i had tape recorders and tape players and i don't know what got into me i would just want to figure out how they worked so i would kind of take them apart and then see that some of it was mechanical and some part was electrical and i would want to learn about the different parts and i think that you know taking things apart learning how things work understanding how systems work is kind of a fun skill for for anyone to develop so tell us more about yourself like what do you like to do outside of work oh well um i live here in santa fe new mexico and uh it's very beautiful so i like to go outdoors and hike and camp i like to play guitar and garden but one hobby that i have that is sort of cs related is the hobby of amateur radio also known as ham radio for weird historical reasons and i'll show you a picture about that so um when you're an amateur radio operator what you do is uh learn the science behind how radio works and build your own uh radios and antennas and communicate with people all over the world or uh off this world what i'm gonna show here is a picture on the left of an antenna at my house that i built and on the right is a picture i got from the international space station as it was going overhead and uh anyone students as young as junior high or high school can even get involved in amateur radio and imagine picking up pictures from the space stations or from weather satellites and i have a lot of fun doing that here in town that sounds super cool so a question about in your professional journey what were some of the titles that you had with the work that you were doing and then what are some of the salary ranges that someone could expect to make with those job titles well my uh journey went through a few different changes in fact i started in the arts field and worked in the music industry in a music recording studio for a long time before i became a roboticist in fact in those days i was making probably 30 or 40 000 running a very small studio during that time i got so interested in the electronics of it you know guitarists and how their signal goes through their pedals or how the mixing board works and i got into the electronics and went back to school so that's what got me back into electrical engineering russian military folks wouldn't mind muting their mics and so then i went back to school for the electrical engineering part i was in school for a while and after that was when i started to get uh jobs like a lecturer in in uh in engineering those kinds of things also pay around forty to fifty thousand dollars um and moving up uh i've worked as what's called a developer a software developer uh where you just say work for people who need custom software made for them um that that pay is often not per year but it really depends on the job so you can work on a job where you may get paid a hundred dollars for a small thing or a thousand dollars for a bigger thing and it really depends um so through the years i've kind of had several different types of of work and now landed where i am and would you be able to tell us like what is a typical salary range for a creative engineer yeah so creative engineers tend to makes uh over 75 000 at meow wolf and uh and yeah and and and they're sort of the top and depends on how long you've been there in your experience and like many other companies that the more knowledge you have in your field and the more experience you have in your field the the better paid you are and so um for creative engineering could you start off do you need first of all a fouryear degree do you need a bachelor's a master's a phd what is required to be a creative engineer well i see the most important part of it is just being a very inquisitive person who loves to design things and make things figure out how things work and you know start picking up the tools to do it like there's a lot of free software out there um and a lot of maker spaces and maker groups that you could sort of get involved with um these days and to be a creative engineer i don't think there's there really isn't a specific educational requirement it's really about your experience and what you know um sort of if you have the experience working in the the stuff that makes meow wolf work um that that's the kind of people that we like on our on our creative engineering team and in fact i should mention our team is several people with lots of different skills so i'm more of a roboticist and we have other people who specialize in lighting other people who specialize in sound others people who specialize in like the i.t infrastructure even so um there's sort of room for all kinds of different interests in creative engineering and so when you come into this space um do you already need to be an expert with coding and computer science or do you get to learn on the job how do you gain more experience with computer science well we don't expect that everyone knows everything right away so um there are some some common things that a lot of folks in our field know so there's a platform out there called arduino that is great for making um circuits and interactive elements that's something we use a lot so if if you know arduino that's that will help you sort of in the creative engineering field but um like i said we're not super specific and i don't expect everyone to know robotics but if you want to get on a project that makes you learn robotics i'll be there to sort of mentor you and that's another thing our team does for each other is you know help each other out with our expertise so there is opportunity for mentorship once you land a job or start working in this field yeah definitely since so much of the job is very unique um you know there aren't a lot of places like meow wolf out there the the stuff that you know is pretty specific and so it's pretty valuable to know that stuff we cross over a lot into how buildings are made too so if you know a lot about the electrical systems or the heating systems in a building as a construction uh or architect worker um that's also a great skill to have great so we have a question from bargin shout out from hillsborough wisconsin what type of process does meow wolf use to come up with their new exhibit um well that's a great question um we're we like to do brainstorming where we kind of all get together and just come up with ideas and um maybe someone will have uh a story idea that's really uh start of an idea like you know someone's going on a journey to a place and then we kind of brainstorm as a big group and i've been part of brainstorming groups with several hundred people if you can imagine that all kind of dreaming up new stories and and ways to tell a story in a place like now we have another question this comes from hopefully pronouncing this correctly kaiokeo regarding coding what languages do you mostly use oh so the top languages that are used on our creative engineering team are touch designer which is a visual language max which is a visual language as well and what i mean by that is um you code by making blocks and connecting them with lines and watching the data sort of flow between the code box and it's a different way of coding than writing text which is an another very popular way of writing code in my group we use processing which is a form of java we also use python a lot as well great maureen garda's class is asking what is the most difficult part of your job oh wow well you know um there are two tricky parts the first tricky part is um figuring out how to take an artistic idea and make it happen technically right you have to sort of interpret almost like interpreting poetry and translating it to another language or really you're translating it into math and code that could be a very tricky part of a project the second trickiest part is actually installing the thing in place some we have to really run wires everywhere and if you can imagine say inside your car how many wires there are and how many buttons and lights and knobs that's a lot of wiring and i often end up completely inside a robot with just my boots sticking out as i'm running wiring it sounds tedious like it takes it's it can be time consuming sometimes it really can yeah a lot of things can take time but you know with patients and with a good team it's a lot of fun so we have another question here from tierra bobola what future technologies can you imagine fourth grade students will be using more of when they are in high school and college careers oh that's a very great question you know i'm in robotics so i can't help but imagine that we'll see more robots all over society uh helping people out and that's a great thing that folks who do now is start thinking of all the wacky robots that don't exist yet that could exist to help people out in the future i can't wait to see uh what we do with that and i can't wait to see maybe robotic characters and stuff and now wolf that would be amazing that's so creative that video you showed us it was a little creepy but intriguing i'm very curious about this uh you know store now in las vegas to check it out so we have another question from maureen garda again so what does your daily schedule look like like what is a typical day for you what are some of your tasks or duties well so a typical day um maybe like today um i'll wake up and you know check my emails and catch up with all my teams and what's going on uh in the company and with our projects um and then i'll usually have a few meetings with people and that's where we sort of get together to either make a decision about something important or maybe bring up something important that we are not aware of um and then i spend most of my day um either writing code or uh designing circuit boards and stuff like that to uh to make our exhibits work so next up i do want to ask you some questions so that you can give our viewers um classrooms tuning in students some advice so looking back on all of your work and educational journey what obstacles or challenges did you face and how did you approach or overcome them um see that's that's an interesting question because as i mentioned earlier i had to transition sort of into the stem field from the arts field at one point so i was working in a music recording studio and i didn't know a lot about the technology but when i went to school and started learning the technology i found it very difficult and i don't think that's surprising for a lot of people that sometimes the math and stuff is hard and even today i run into very hard technical problems all the time um still it's not like one day you just solve them but what i did discover when i faced these problems was that i wasn't the only one you could always find other people who are as confused as you inform study groups um form teams form um communities and next thing you know you're helping each other learn and you kind of all level up as a group so what were there people who helped you along the way who were they and how did they help you oh yeah i had i guess a lot of help from from my teachers along the way who supported me um one in particular when i was in high school um i had a physics teacher named mr bertson who saw that i was interested in sculpting with weird materials while i was in art class and he offered me his physics lab so that i could use his bunsen burners to melt glass and make sculptures out of that kind of stuff but he also taught me how to properly use lab equipment and also taught me the physics of what i was doing with the materials i was playing with and for me it was so important to have someone who was interested in my creativity but also interested in teaching me what i was doing so that i could make better projects later yeah and was there someone specifically that helped you perhaps with the cs you mentioned that there's challenges with the math and computer science aspects of that um is there someone that stands out to you that helped you through those difficult times um well i had professors who helped me out but really it was it was my my teammates and my friends and and the the people in the classes with me who were just as as stumped as i was on some of these hard math problems uh my my friends like henry my friends like vladimir who we would sit there and at the same computer look at the same code all three of us and go what is this doing and then at some point one of us would get it and then all of us would get it yeah that sounds i can relate to that as well and so just a quick reminder please add your questions to the q a as we're getting ready to wrap up so if students are interested in pursuing similar career paths like the ones you've mentioned as a creative engineer what are some steps that they can take well um you know keep keep making things find find some tools that you could use to to learn to make things however you like whether it's writing poetry or playing guitar or writing code um you know find a way to uh to learn a skill and sort of get better at it and learn to express things and if you could give one piece of advice to students who are listening um it could be work related or not what would it be oh wow um well i guess i'll just jump off of that that same answer i just gave that you should start start building and start writing and start making the world that you want to live in that's great advice and so this is a question from mr a how long does it take to work on a single project oh well it all depends some projects can be this big and those might take me like a day i sometimes i have let's see if i could pull something up here i have a project that maybe you could see this is might look like some of your experiments here just wiring and sensors i'm testing out a bunch of sensors to see how they work a project like this might only take me a week because there's a lot of um code out there that i could grab test and then um see if things worked out but a bigger project like for example that robot that i showed you earlier might take a couple of months and the longest project i the longest i've worked on a project is probably about a couple of months and do you mean that comes from like the idea to the actual finished product yeah that's usually from from the time that we start drawing some drawings of what we think it should look like until it's really done that that can actually take even i had i guess i hadn't considered at the beginning the whole concept and how you come up with your idea that can take a whole month just by itself if you have a very big concept like i know this when we come up with our stories for our whole uh building that could take several months and so really quick danny what is the most fun what's the funnest most fun thing about your job oh man working working with a team of people that i really like to build something that that we think is going to inspire people um to do this themselves we we want people to walk out of meow wolf thinking um i could do this too let's go out there and change the world to to match what we want it to be like well thank you danny for joining us today and sharing your cs journeys and thank you teachers and students for joining in please remember to check out other chats this spring as well as past chats from the fall at code.org forward slash cs journeys also teachers please check your email for a survey we value your feedback and want to know how to make these chats better for you and your students so thank you so much danny thank you sorry and thanks everybody out there byebye bye
