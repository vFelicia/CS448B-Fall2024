when i first got rolling it was kind of easier back then in some ways and harder in other ways the actual code was easier back then at the same time today you have much better resources you have code.org you have a search results for pretty much any tech question you would ever want to ask you have school courses you you might even have teachers today that know how to code understand how the internet works and can teach you that's a pretty incredible resource that i didn't have around me growing up probably the first website i ever built was just copying the html code from yahoo.com and just editing it until it was david's website and you know the more you do that the more you actually start to learn the language yourself and you're able to start to build the stuff from scratch putting your putting your work out there early even before it's perfect even before you really have found your voice yet and know what you're trying to say is a an amazing feeling and an amazing learning experience and a chance to start to connect with people who will kind of take you the rest of the way there but if you have any aspirations putting your idea putting your work out there into the world start now
