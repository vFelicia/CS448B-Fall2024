how we all doing this morning oh I like the woo let's hear some noise get some energy flowing um welcome to day2 of cson I hope you all had an amazing day one uh I was in some of the sessions that were really engaging a lot of great conversation a lot of great questions um a lot of really awesome hallway discussions as well so um look forward to more of that today we're going to hopefully fill your cup today with lots of things to talk about um I heard there were folks that some things last night went to the sphere uh had a chance to um take in some of the sight so hopefully you all got a chance to also participate in the fun the city has to offer us so uh I'm Kim megi I'm the chief product officer with code.org and I'm going to be hosting a panel this morning on the topic of AI and the future of work so we'll get going with that um so as all good talks uh on AI uh du these days I started by playing a bit with AI to help me um prepare for uh this panel um so I prompted AI to basically uh Envision the AI enabled worker of the future uh I'm going to I'm going to read for you what it says here um some of you might not be able to read this so this is chat GPT and Dolly 2 that help me do this so meet Sarah uh whose day seamlessly incorporates AI her morning starts with AI sorting her inbox flagging urgent emails summarizing key points in meetings AI takes notes generates action items and suggests Solutions based on past discussion when she digs into work AI analyzes vast amounts of data offers customer insights forecast future Trends and potential Market shifts empowering her to make informed decisions on opportunities or risks that would otherwise take hours to uncover AI has become Sarah's indispensable partner amplifying her productivity insights and confidence confidence in the modern work landscape so there's some really interesting words there that AI generated for you and I did this in like one shot with a little bit of eding and that image was a first shot image so um not bad I was I was pretty actually was mildly surprised honestly what happened um so we've all seen headlines like these predicting the future of work in an age of AI from job loss to reskilling to automation to rizen Global GDP occurring at the same time the headlines are a wash with fortune tellers and doomsayers on the future of work in an age of AI um I'm sure many of you have also seen data like this don't worry I'm not going to give you a quiz on what the data points say um you probably can't see them but what you should see here is a lot of dots to the right of that line that says average so this is basically a visualization that the Washington Post created based on a research study that looked at the potential impact of AI on various occupations and what they did was they measured the exposure of that occupation given the tasks that the job uh entails and what AI is good at and so here you know um you're probably not going to be surprised management business and finance higher possibility of exposure and impact science and computer science what a lot of folks in this room are talking about um greater chance of impact there healthcare workers another area where we see the potential for impact and education and Social Services things that we might care about in this room um so you might not agree to what extent the state is pointing at I don't know if anyone really does know at this stage but I think we can probably agree that AI will have a meaningful impact on knowledgebased work another set of interesting headlines which we've all seen that compare artificial and human intelligence so here assessments which are you know obviously a key tool for us as a society to ensure that practitioners are skilled and knowledgeable for their future occupations yeah can not now not only match Human Performance but in many cases exceed Human Performance here's some data from um open AI themsel that quantify on a percentile basis where AI would have scored relative to Human Performance so um and then you can also see here uh if you squint the blue is GPT 3.5 and the green adds on what happens when we um sort of throw gp4 at those tools so in this session we're going to discuss the how AI will impact the future of work our goal is to leave you with Food For Thought we're not going to give you the answer to the question because I don't think any of us know we were talking about that this morning so open questions lots of great discussions to have but we are going to leave you with some food for thought and maybe some questions for you all to consider as you bring this very important topic into discussions and the work that you do uh okay so with that I'd like your help in welcoming our panelists to the stage uh and I will start with Nicole Cario who is director of AI and Society at the Allen Institute for AI sh give it up thank you welcome Nicole uh Shena hope who who's the director of education for social impact at Google you guys can make noise come on let's make some noise there we go thank you welcome shenica and Michael trano a visiting fellow at the bkings institution there we go all right awesome so we're gonna start off here by getting to know our panelist a little bit um so I'd love uh to do a warmup question with you all okay so the question is is what what was your aha moment um with generative AI in your work so specifically what I mean is when did you personally or maybe viscerally realized the potential for AI to change work for good or for otherwise maybe maybe for not good uh I'll let you all decide what what that moment was I'll start with my moment my moment was so I have a computer science and an engineering background but I haven't written code in 15 years so uh and I wanted to do a little little thing at work where I was uh trying to break a little bit of Technology into a um a piece of work that I was doing and I thought well let me let me see what AI can do here and in about an hour which blew me away I was able to essentially solve this problem that probably would have taken me multiple days to kind of res skill myself on the tools of coding and go through that whole process so that was the moment when I was like okay this is going to be a really meaningful change for us so um who wants to go next how about Nicole yeah um I think for me so I work at an artifici intelligence Research Institute and so the teams that I work with are the ones creating technology that's powering a lot of the things that are happening today and so for me it was actually seeing their response um and watching them say oh this is a big giant leap forward um you know our one of our teams at ai2 was focused on their their charge was reasoning and how do we help this technology pass SC an eighth grade science exam for example they achieved that in 2019 that was not that long ago and so to see the Giant leap that um you know chat GPT brought forth and also to see the giant momentum that it had within just pop culture um that's when it was the moment for me yeah I would I would Echo um both of your comments I think um the work that I lead at Google we are focused on understanding those factors that drive or create kind of LeapFrog momentum and ensuring that there is Equitable access uh and participation to Computing and I think when and it was actually in November of last year when chat GPT came onto the education scene we were floored by the rapid and the accelerated uh visibility and adoption um of that that tool and one of the things that we did um is we actually did some analysis around standards alignment work uh specifically focused on trying to understand efficiencies that it could potentially bring into the classroom for educators and I've my my in a previous life prior to Google 20 years in public education I've led a number of curriculum um experiences where we adopting new curriculum standards Etc moving it into public comment we were able to move through a standards alignment um exercise that normally would take months in a matter of hours and that was it just floored us with 80 plus percent accuracy by the way pretty incredible and so for me that was probably one of the first like ah oh my goodness wow this is can be pretty powerful can create a bit of a superpower for the work and the things that we're trying to accomplish uh not just in the classroom but in the workforce as well yeah thanks km uh and thanks everyone uh yeah I mean my personal AA moment um I've been playing around with genit of AI tools for a while uh in ways that I thought could help me be creative uh where I couldn't be because I just didn't have the skills but I think my real aha moment with Chachi BT um you know we all have drudgery in parts of our jobs parts of our lives and I worked at the World Bank for 26 years and I would constantly be asked to do last minute briefings for important people and I got a note uh from someone uh last December and they said you know we've got some important person coming in we need a briefing sheet in the next hour and it was a topic I worked on and but I hadn't worked on it for quite a while so I just had uh my previous had chat GPT summarized my previous work gave me a quick briefing sheet I just um annotated a little bit sent along and I thought you know this is a part of my job that I hate and now I well hopefully won't have to do it as often um and that was really my aha moment I guess I would say love thank you all for sharing those yeah so many interesting uh ways in which we all experience AI in this early stage um so I want to get to sort of one of the hard of the questions we're going to talk about today um but I want to I want to set it up a little bit so this morning we came in a little bit early to to uh just you know mic test and whatnot we got in a nice chat about about um about TV shows that we watch you're going to hear a little bit about that maybe throughout the session one of the TV shows that we were talking about was Black Mirror I I can't I can barely see you all but just even like wave your hand Black Mirror does that have you seen it do are you familiar with it okay so you know kind of a little bit technophobia dystopian view of the future with technology um and so you know I think a little bit of even this conversation might touch on that so I'm going to hearken to that conversation and ask the first question which is overall are you bullish or bearish on the impacts that AI can have on work and and tell us a little bit a little bit about why and maybe shenica if you can lead us off yeah sure I would I would say I am quite bullish about the opportunity of AI in terms of transformation in the workforce um you know we we know and recognize and understand that technology has shaped and changed the anatomy of Workforce um for for for decades but the opportunity of artificial intelligence I think you know this is new for us in terms of really understanding the scope the size the speed the depth of that transformation that's something that we're all still learning and trying to understand together but when you take a look at a lot of the early signals and a lot of the research that's coming out of thing places like the world economic Forum some of the headlines that km uh showed earlier you look at some of the work that Mackenzie has put out what we do what we're finding uh based off of some of these early signals is that in the next 10 years 70% of the workforce Global Workforce will be touched in some way shape or form by generative AI specifically the knowledge work sectors there's based on early signals we're seeing that there will be roughly a 50% impact in terms of productivity and efficiency in the knowledge Workforce and when we say knowledge these are typically the careers that are typically mid High skill typically High wage um where you often times see or uh the types of skills that are being asked of knowledge work uh is that of synthesis analysis um pulling together information uh design in terms of like first drafts generative AI based on the early signals that we're seeing will absolutely have a s substantial impact on those kinds of SE on those sectors um and that's also tied to what generative AI actually is it's based on large language models that are pulling in a a lot of information using algorithms that are leaning in on probability and statistics to try to predict the next set of the next words sets of words and so when you think about that and you think about what the knowledge sector does it would make sense that generative AI would have implications in the knowledge sector probably uh at at at greater implications than in other spaces and again when I say transformation or change we're talking about productivity and efficiency and so that's not the create fear for those types of Industries what it really is it's to frame it to help us to understand that the parts of the work that are that can be unique to the human it frees us up to focus in on more of the complex and more sophisticated and nuanced aspects of our work and take uh Leverage The Power of artificial intelligence to help with automation love that point yeah awesome uh Nicole Michael your thoughts bullish or bearish yeah so um yes yes yes okay and I'll say I'm so I've worked for you know quarter Century in institutions filled with economists I'm not one uh and with labor economists I'm not a labor Economist so uh some of my colleagues will no doubt take issue with some of the things I say um but I know that they'll take would take greater issue with things that they say uh between each other given the way economists are so with that caveat out of the out of the way um I mean I'm bullish for Education yeah I mean I think the potential Returns on education and the importance and centrality of Education I don't see how um uh how not to be bullish with that um on the flip side um you know inequality which is the defining feature of our society our societies around the world today and the real worry I think legitimate worry is that we're going to be increasingly polarized as there are increased returns to certain types of Labor what are we going to do as a society with people who are whatever Left Behind who lose jobs I I'm overall bullish but of course as with any sort of automation or with techn olical advances they're going to be certain groups they going to be certain geographies who really suffer a lot and with what's happening with AI generative AI now um some of this will happen quickly I think most of it will happen over the medium term you know with uh autonomy and vehicular autonomy you know there was a big prediction that oh truck drivers are going to go away and that's going to well I mean truck driving typically isn't the greatest it's it's a tough job yeah and in the 10 years since a lot of big predictions were made about that you know we've had huge um we need more truck drivers we don't have enough and some of the things we can automate away would be great to automate away so I'm both bearish and bullish but recognizing that um the impact as you know since the uh Weavers in Silesia um you know destroyed their Looms in the in the early 1900s it's really going to impact 1800s impact people uh in very different ways love that balance that's an awesome uh awesome way to answer the question Nicole how about your thoughts yeah I agree with the yes I feel like I'm kind of in the middle on certain things in in the you know on one side and the other I think my challenge is that there are you know the tool is the tool it's not the thing that's going to cause disruption it's the decision makers that are going to cause a disruption and I'm not sure how much faith I have in the system that we've seen fail before on other technology technological advancements so what I think is that there's huge potential and huge opportunity and we as a society are at this Reckoning moment where we have to view it as this real turning point so I think think um you know there are you know to the point about autonomous vehicles truck drivers if they are displaced that's then what will they do right so I agree it's a hard job and it's a job that we have a lot of people in and so there's a lot of decisions around um you know social safety nets and things that we don't always have these really rich conversations about I also think you know college costs are rising and rising and Rising um so if we're asking people to now take on more college debt or asking people to get more education then we're kind of setting people up to fail so I'm pointing this out because I agree with all of the things you said but I I also go back to the um you know how are we making sure that this technology is distributed in a way that is Equitable and isn't driving these bigger divides and that is you know when we're relying on a government that's not the most functional to make some of these choices and we're relying on businesses who are incentivized by their financial returns to make some of these decisions um that's where I get that is what I am concerned about not the technology I think the technology can do so many things so yeah if I could just quickly build on that thanks Kim um Nicole makes an an incredibly important point and we had an earlier discussion as part when we first came in to do the walkthrough uh Beyond just the Golden Girls and the the the mirror uh um television program but we we also talked about to to that very point that the technology and the potential of the technology is absolutely incredible um it it can in fact create a bit of a superpower for the strengths that a human and and our knowledge um that we can bring to bear to any any sector right but it's going to take a collective Coalition and that's all of us in the room public and private to ensure that we're putting sufficient safeguards around the technology so that as we the as with any technology as it begins to to be adopted into uh Society that there are we are thinking intentionally and early about how do we make sure that we're upscaling people sufficiently how are we making sure that we can help PE individuals understand the technology is augmenting your work now in this new way and so we're also going to invest back in in you to ensure that you can use the technology so that you can make that necessary pivot I also took a point about the cost of Education one of the things that we were talking about is how the technology and through the education space there's power and potential in using it as a of a copilot and for tutoring and so that you can integrate it so it's real time and near time one of the things that uh one of the economic reports I think the world for and I think it was actually one of the headlines that that showed that one of the things that we were trying to figure out uh back to the early signals and just the implications on the workforce they're going to be four primary sectors where we see 70% of some of that transformation happening and again these are early signals so you know let's be let's let's be you know let's take it for what it's it is but those four sectors are going to be around customer service and support marketing and sales software development and R&D again these are knowledge knowledge creation sectors and what the early signals are telling us in those four sectors is that yes there's going to be pivots that are going to be required to happen in these in these industries but it's not about displacing people it's about a clear recognition that pivots must happen but we need to di to move that human the unique human strength on the more nuanced complex complex aspects of the work and so I really believe that's what we have to lean in on is training people and readying them for the the the the understanding that this technology is going to augment the way of work that's a great point and it's also a really good lead into where i' love to take the conversation um about sort of Skilling displacement and so um so the question I want to POS POS is you know we've heard a lot about job loss right um at least headlines talk about job loss when you get a little bit more under the hood and start to look at both the research and and and some of the the details behind um the headline you start to see that there's there's more Nuance in this conversation so but I'm going to ask the non Nuance question let you all do the nuancing part so okay do you believe we'll see job creation for job loss what what where are you at on this and and Nicole maybe you can start us off on this one yeah um I think we're going to see both and going to be different based on the sector and it's going to be different based on the skill level um and it's also going to be different based on globally where you are because I think you know I I often tend to as a US citizen over index on the uscentric approach to this and so I will try to be mindful of that um and I have a great example I'll share later about brilliant work happening in the global South that we create um in fact I'm just going to go there now um job creation so data is so valuable if we don't have data we don't have ai and so there is a tremendous amount of work around data collection curation annotation that's happening um the example I was going to share is there's an amazing organization out of India called karia and they are moving generations of people out of poverty by paying them an above living wage to share their data which is such a valuable resource I think for so long we've heard around about data privacy and we've heard about you know you be be careful of your data um and that is still all true but at the if you speak a language that is not heavily resourced in the data um if you speak a language that is in danger of going away you are now like the most valuable golden shiny object because data is so valuable so I think there's there is a huge um need and job creation opportunity there um Kia is doing incredible work finding it's it's largely women that they're working with with these women are now making more than their husbands they're having to have secret bank accounts so that they can put money it's tremendous what is happening and the confidence and the empowerment that is coming with this is literally lifechanging and it's changing the face of these communities and they're expanding throughout the global South to capture more and more languages so that is a tremendous job creation opportunity um I would also say you know I have friends who are digital creatives who have you know they're on their 400th thousandth application and they're not getting a job and so we can't Overlook the impact of certain industries um a creative you know that I worked with for years and years who is a brilliant person in her career um and advanced in her career is just like I now have to make a change I this is no longer the career for me so if we can get ahead of helping people see when their job is at risk because there are jobs at risk and helping them res skill upskill find new things that has to be a priority now because the the Technology's capabilities today are not such that you should be firing your copywriting teams five years from now it might be I mean five who knows when that's going to happen but that's that's coming where you know you won't have to fact check your briefing as as well um that that time is coming and so how do we get ahead of it and that's where we'll get into more job creation um and so to your to answer your question it's going to be both and I think it's going to have tremendous impacts in both so I think that context point is really important I love the example really good good use case to understand that it's not a it's not a yes or no it's a timeline it's a yes and it's both that are going to occur depending upon context so U Michael Shenika how would you like to so I think so who knows right uh the problem with predicting the future is we don't know it yet um I'm I'm confident in stating that I think people who you use AI in their jobs will replace people who don't use AI in their jobs I mean that's one general statement I would make um you know uh you know I talked to business owners and and they they might say um you know look at what chat gbt and these tools um look all the marketing copy copy that they can put out I don't need as many people to do marketing I tend to think I I I don't think you know there's a sort of the the um the lump fallacy that there's only so much work that can be done I think people do more marketing yeah and I think um that there are all sorts of jobs you know when ATMs came out they said that's that you know we won't have any more bank tellers and what happened for 30 years is we had a rise in the number of bank tellers because we could put banks in all sorts of new places and supplement them with and we saw we 10 years ago we heard about radiology and don't have your kid become a radiologist because that's going to be obsolute we have more Radiologists today than we do did 10 years ago who knows what it'll be in in 20 years um so just another I guess caution about making too many predictions but uh you know I think this idea that uh so the Scottish Economist um you know um William Stanley jivon talked about a paradox when he saw that um when the steam engine was created and it made the use of coal much more efficient the idea is okay then we won't need to use as much coal and they saw the exact opposite we're using coal much more I tend to think with a lot some of the jobs that we're talking about um that won't be replaced it will just allow us to do more of that and and the challenge I think of fear of a lot of people is that um you know the first wave of it automation took away um a lot of uh or threatened a lot of jobs that relied on uh routine cognitive tasks yeah those could be and now we're worried it's coming for the the quote unquote real knowledge workers who are doing nonroutine cognitive work um maybe I think it may be we may see a redefinition of what um nonroutine cognitive work means you know if you're graphic designer yeah and I just need to hire somebody to give me a picture of a mountain fair enough uh machine can do that is that a nonroutine cognitive task or are we going to change our sort of definition how we think about these things yeah I love the the the point you're you're making about redefining work and that's where I want to go next actually I think this is a really critical uh topic for this group to be discussing um with with that before we jump into that next question what I'd like to do is share a video clip um from a professional learning series uh that code.org created uh partnership with KH Academy IST and ETS it's called AI 101 for teachers uh and and the clip is going to be a conversation between Sal Con uh from KH Academy and um Cod org CEO hadti partovi and they're going to talk a little bit about the industry impact um on AI and it touches on this question so um if you can queue up the uh industry impact video C of AI is going to touch every industry at at every every possible part of it now I do want to make clear a lot of people have started to differentiate which I think is an important thing between jobs and tasks I think it's going to allow a lot of folks to do more tasks more productively but it's not going to replace in many cases whole whole jobs so pretty much any job where you have to do any type of writing I think you're going to have a productivity Improvement at least 2x probably more any job where you have to create presentations you have to create any type of artifact uh probably any job that involves working with a computer in any way is going to become in some way not replaced by AI but Easier by AI which means whether you're writing code whether you're reviewing contracts if you're writing a patent if you're reviewing a patent if you're creating marketing if you're posting to social media uh if you're WR creating a spreadsheet or analyzing data with a spreadsheet everywhere from marketing to sales to accounting you name it AI isn't going to replace your job it'll make your job easier because certain tasks that are repetitive will become completely automated certain tasks where you might have writers block AI might make the first draft for you or help you out or give you Corrections uh to basically reduce the time you need to spend to get the job done one of the things is important is when you think about how much all digital work is going to be impacted by AI is recognizing how critical it is that our education system teaches students what this is is how to use it how it works and what are its risks what are its strengths and weaknesses because right now most adults just treat it as a sort of magical tool like oh it just came out and it's magic uh but it's important to actually understand the underpinnings of what is a large language model realizing that it's using statistics to generate its thoughts to realize that that statistical generation is why it can make mistakes uh and recognizing that it's been trained on data so the data that it's used to figure out what it's creating could have biases could have you know missing gaps in the data things like that uh it's important for students to as they get prepared for this Workforce of the future to know how the technology they're using in these future jobs is actually working so um so I'd love to pick up uh on both uh the conversation s and how had and and Michael's last Point um and Shena maybe you can lead us off on this so how how do you see the way in which we work changing like if we think about redefining what work means um kind of uh even though we're not suers go ahead and and look into that crystal ball a little bit so I'll wave the wand um no and but but seriously I think I think look we we as a collective Society have have been here before our our society has seen first wave uh our society has encountered inventions new technology um and our society has learned to adapt and adjust I have a lot of Hope and Faith and in us as society and our Collective Global society that said when I think about the future of work I think it's exactly what um what both Sal and and hottie mentioned I see the technology and every all the signals that we see today is that the technology is going to be used as a collaborator and as a copilot um to help create greater efficiencies to help increase productivity and it's going to augment the things that we as humans do to make us more efficient to allow us to Pivot our energy our and our our uniqueness as humans to a task allow us to really index and focus our time and effort there um that's what I see in terms of the transformation based on all of the signals that we see I do believe that it will be incumbent on us to lean in on on the basic building blocks that we know happen in the early years the formative years we need to think critically we need to understand how to communicate effectively we need to understand how to collaborate into team um that those you know the 21st century skills when I was a teacher in the classroom these are the things those building blocks will not change and we must help our young people have a very strong foundation around computational thinking right because again these are tools these tools are also created by flawed individuals human beings and so it's incumbent on us as we think about today's Workforce and the future Workforce is that we're teaching students and professionals to interrogate the outputs from the technology the technology is a collaborator and a copilot that's what I believe and see I see it as augmenting the strengths that are uniquely human love that point Nicole yeah I would Echo the um executive functioning skills as like the North Star I said this in a panel yesterday we you know I would amend hotti statement slightly by saying people need to know how to use this technology and understand this technology they also have to understand how to exist with this technology because it's not going away and that is the executive functioning skills that should be so front and center um I'd also say this is so important of a moment where AI literacy comes in because if we don't understand the capabilities of the technology then we may be laying people off who don't need to be laid off because we're over indexing and putting too much trust in the technology so I the the AI literacy component of this just can't be understated um if we if people are tasked with you know bringing big returns to their shareholders then that's their charge and if they think that the way to do that is not by augmenting but by supplementing or replacing then that's what's going to happen so there's a literacy an AI understanding what can the technology do the challenge with that um I did a study in 2021 of you know people's understanding of AI capabilities and surprisingly we found you know only 16% had a a passing understanding of AI literacy I'm redoing that survey now and I often consult with people across the globe that I collaborate with and we are getting so into the details on does AI understand cause and effect this person says yes this person says no so it's even within the field of AI there are these big questions about the current capabilities um and so we need to solve for a general level of understanding so that people can really make smart and informed choices with how they're deploying how they're collaborating um and how this technology is is being used can I just jump in really quick before Mike answers I I just want to build off a point that Nicole made thank you you're gracious to me um you know when you think about in the space of mathematics this thought came to mind and and our one of our leaders in Google Maggie Johnson um a who understands deeply computer science but also Computer Science Education and one of the points that she she recently made which I thought was exactly right which is think about in the space of mathematics when the you know the ad you know the calculator coming into the classroom and and just Mass adoption um it didn't wipe away our need to understand how to add and subtract what it did do is it brought us together to understand that we need to have a a number sent what is the number sense the basic knowledge that every individual needs to have in light of these tools that are available to us in mathematics I think it's a similar thing back to your point about artificial intelligence um AI literacy we need to have a an AI sense that is generally understood so that we understand what this is that it's not magic and by the way it is flawed right and so with us having a a baseline understanding of AI back to to your literacy point it will set us up well to answer some of these harder questions around things like what values are being placed that are invisible into the algorithms and into the technology and into the infrastructure so these are the things I cannot stress enough your point Nicole about the literacy Baseline it's it's a must so um it's about time for Q&A but um thinking you know I'm worried that a lot of the discussions around Ai and the workforce quickly be discussions around efficiency yeah and so there are efficiency arguments and effic efficiency analyses we can do and we should be doing um but um I mean all of us here were involved in the grand experiment in remote learning and remote work uh during the fabulous thing we all went through a couple years ago and I don't know hopefully very few or none of you in this room uh had new software put on your computers AI enabled software to essentially surveil what you were doing uh in the uh the worry that you weren't working or that and and then people say oh we can look at this now we can actually measure efficiency of our workers in new ways um My worry is that when some of these AI tools enable uh us to be treated like machines ourselves um those are the exact types of function type work that can be automated away and I think you know educ we're all Educators in this room I mean education is fundamentally a human endeavor and in talking with uh policy makers around the world especially in places where there aren't teachers or there are insufficiently supported teachers and Ministers of Education have said to me I mean we don't have teachers in these places or they're young or they they they don't know their subjects very well and wouldn't be great if AI could complement and maybe um where they don't exist where they could do the job of teachers and it's yeah okay yeah there's there's a there's a place um for that but um My worry is that the you talked about the next digital divide and education is about access to AI who has access to it and who doesn't My worry is that it'll become about who has access to people and who only has access to technology and hopefully that's not the world that we're going towards and if we are we have we well we will always have time hopefully but we have time now to think about what we might want to do to prevent that you're describing a Black Mirror episode yeah exactly yeah we we to bring it home Michael thank you describing actual conversations I've had with Ministers of Education uh addressing very real needs today and you know tomorrow's needs are subordinate to today's needs can I just add one point too um even if you're relying whatever you're relying it on it for today it's also predominantly English it's predominantly developed by a very specific group of people and so depending on where you know you're you're over indexing on a certain group already because again the technolog is not Advanced enough to be representational and diverse and so efficiency for who what does that even look like so yeah that's awesome um so I do want to make sure we have a little bit of time for some Q&A from you all but I'm going to ask for one last sentence from each person and the question when it POS is uh actually it picks up even on this last uh discussion so we have a a room full of very influential people here that can steer a good portion of the discussion we've just had what the future of society and the future of work looks like to the work they do uh in education what's a piece of advice you're going to you're GNA give to these folks and maybe Nicole you can lead us off yeah um I would say there I I said this yesterday on a panel and I'll say it again as a start like ask the dumb questions because somebody else will have them I ask dumb questions all the time um because this technolog is new there's not consensus around a lot of things and so if you're using a tool and it seems to be underperforming or overperforming for a specific demographic call that out like pull the fire alarm these are the things that I think are so important as this technology develops and becomes more and more ubiquitous and then make sure that there are spaces that are being created for learning about this technology about the potential about the use cases um you know it's it's a tool it's it is it's a tool to be used it shouldn't be the dictator it shouldn't be the the place of a human there should always be a human decision maker at the end um of the use of a tool like this thanks Nicole Shena yeah I would I would go to the point of a coalition um it's going to take all of us in this room um public priv to collectively explore the opportunities of this technology but also to put sufficient safeguards in place to ensure that we're harnessing the technology for good um and so that's what I would say we need Collective action together to solve for this it's not for engineers to solve it's not for you know uh government to solve we have to do it do it together the last thing I would also say is there's I know that there's also some energy around fear around this techn technology and to to coin something I'm going to terribly paraphrase Marie cury um but her point this point that she made in a quote which is fear is can be driven out through knowledge and so take the time to build your understanding of the opportunity and get caught doing doing the work to try to make sure that we're putting the safeguards in place together so that we're not leaving anyone behind yeah Nicole said if you're using the tools I mean hopefully you're using the tools yeah I mean that's the big deal um I was talking with an expert Ai and education expert and he was talking me about some of the image Generation stuff and talking about using mid journey and I mentioned Discord and he had no idea what I was talking about I'm wondering what this guy is actually doing I later found out that you know he was an expert in crypto uh year and a half ago and so there are people moving into these SP but just you know I put aside an hour a day which I don't have literally to just be immersed in tools I mean immers in the tools all day long anyway but um if this new world of work is Dawning on us and and it's going to happen we we may as well be in it as soon as we can and just just use the stuff ask dumb questions and and and look dumb too because you got to look dumb before you look less dumb well we'll we're gonna we're going to end on that note so you all have your called to actions out there and uh let's go to some uh some Q&A from yall we've got just under 10 minutes so and I can't see anything so if the lights can go up that'd be great hi looks like we have a sorry I think they've handed me a mic so I'm going to start way over here on the corner oh my God there you are hello hi uh my name is leizer I'm the executive director of computer science for all um and I love the conversation thank you so much for thinking about this intersection of um work which is actually the foundational way many people pay to live in this country and exist with some kind of subsistence um and I really love that notion of computational thinking um combined with computational questioning it's really important that we understand not just that technology can be right or wrong I'm curious about how we bring into the conversation how it's wrong the notion of instead of an error rate an error Matrix right if you're trying to detect breast cancer you want it to be wrong more saying somebody might have a problem than saying they're all clear right just like if we're trying to leap over a Chasm we'd rather leap too far than Too Short right and so how do we bring the conversation of how it's wrong not just that it's wrong into the bigger picture thoughts I I mean so how do we do one I think is one thing we do is we insist in various ways or agitate for evangelize for um tools that would help us understand what these tools are actually doing so things transparency if we are going to um have set up these matrices and be I mean to actually understand what's happening understand where there might be I mean alignment problems imagine everyone in the in the room is familiar with that term I mean I think one thing that we can all do collectively and that we can only do collectively really is educate uh um for more transparency um you know this there was a tool released maybe early this week or last week around transparency of some of these AI tools that found them all basically wanting in ways that were both subtle and profound and I think absent some of uh ability to have insights into what's happening that will constrain our ability to do exactly what you suggest yeah I would add too um there has to be more space and patience for when things come out as wrong and the example that I go back to is you know Amazon we all heard Amazon had a hiring tool that they were they were developing that was over indexing on rejecting women and people of color because if you said you were part of a specific team or you said the word women in your resume it was just it was over indexing on rejecting those applications the tool was a brilliant case study in bias in the it wasn't rolled out so they didn't use it and it was instead of them diving in and like publicly having that conversation it was like the you know the pr team or whoever said you know we got to shut it down and we need more of those learnings because that is a brilliant case study in so many different types of learning and you know right now ai can read a lung cancer um or you know give a lung cancer diagnosis better than a radiologist that's one of the things it does very well um and to get there it had to be wrong a lot and it had to be right a lot and so you know those are the things that are sort of happening behind the scenes but the more we publicly share those I think the better and play around if you ask chat GPT today and you don't have the extra boosted gp4 version um you're very likely going to get really madeup citations you know that's a great way to play around check the citations be use your critical think check the the um check their work and so I think um playing around with the tools is another way to see how they're wrong and to really under give get an understanding of um what is happening under the covers because right now we also you know we could have a whole other panel on you know open models versus closed models and transparency and what that means and at ai2 we really push for you know moving from a black box to a glass box because in order to solve some of these open research questions um we need to be able to get into the full stack of the model in order to understand what it's doing and when and why and so also moving towards this more open and transparent research is critical could I just say 30 seconds quickly uh just really quickly uh I would point to a number of Frameworks so Google has responsible uh a responsible AI framework uh Singapore has released a framework uh as well and what's lovely about a number of these Frameworks is they provide a whole host of questions because net net our philosophy is that those closest to the problem space must be armed with a set of questions and they must determine this idea and this notion of right and wrong right so really I would lean in on the Frameworks that provide some guiding questions to help lead towards this this this idea of having a conversation about what's right what's wrong in terms of these inputs and outputs I would also add the people who are impacted should also be at the table from the beginning and that's not always what's happening um you know unfortunately and so that s that solves a lot of different problems even in the executive order that came out this week you know the voices of workers was part of the the order that Biden had put forth um and so bringing people to the table sooner in the process versus getting just the application or just the way it's used is a tremendous opportunity all right I'm going to try and make sure we get two more questions in here so I think David's got a question right here yes thank you uh Senator Wiman from uh Washington State and I chair uh education um but I started my career on Main frame so I go by back and to me I think a lot of what we have to do is to translate what is happening for people whether it's within our schools whether it's within our legislators to get them to move things that they have to move and for me um you know I go back to uh warock and gki and say hey postcript was AI postcript took what we uh had to use machines to code and it turned it into something that went to a printer and and did what it did but also within two years 1500 typ Setters in the United States were gone they were no longer needed that job was over and I think you know that's really important so we go way back with AI it's different with generative AI where we actually can pose the question um the rest of us can now have that added capability aui is an AI um you know that we've had for years and I think U just to say there is a movie that I think would be very useful just to to take a look at which is called knowledge Navigator and it talks about the interaction with the human and and Ai and it was produced by Apple in 1987 um it's on YouTube and it's it's I think you know I think we have to make it comfortable for people as well because this can get really scary fast so just some comments yeah thank you for adding those comments and great resources and great points that you made um let's go uh how about over in this side of the room uh we'll take question I see a hand kind of in the middle over here maybe uh David okay thank you Ali Gallagher from policy analysis for California education my question is actually about this concept of coalitions and getting the end user involved and I wonder um given the comments that you made before about the nature of the governments that we have right now and also the incentives that the private sector has how will those spaces get created and how are people who feel like they are end users what paths do you see to empowering them to get into those spaces if they don't see where they exist shenica do you want to feel that one I love that you threw me that question I think that's an incredible question I wish I had the answers I do I do not I I think from from my vantage point it's about deliberate action I think a lot of it's going to have to be Grassroots I think it also has to be anchored in and uh intentional knowledge and understanding the space um I think look I think we this group we have a lot of power we have more power than we realize and I think it I think it's going to require us to take some risks ask hard questions of both the industry but also the government um but I I I don't I don't know if I have the answer I just know that we can't solve this unless we try to solve it together um I'll throw that over to my other colleagues I would add so as when we work on Research when we work on creating models we we need to do a better job of including people and we are starting to move that way we just rolled out some new processes that involve people at the beginning so we're you know I one of the things that's interesting is people who are creating the foundation models today are not always thinking about the use cases because it is a baseline technology and so when you look at the full pipeline um there are so many different inflection points so I think there is responsibility throughout that process we have a responsibility to as we're creating a model what are the potential use cases and how are we bringing in those voices I'm working on a project now where we are um doing a a survey and a study with people to brainstorm potential use cases and talk about values aligned with those types of things um that's one example of where like we should have ownership as a research organization um people who are developing technology and developing apps built on top of these models absolutely should be having conversations with people who will be impacted and then there are you know again back to the executive order nist is going to be putting out safety standards right in the public comment like there will be I'm sure a public comment process do it it seems like you may be lost in the shuffle but they read them and so putting like participating in the Democracy that we are in in the US as an example to be uscentric is a way to get your voice to be heard and so I would encourage that um having just written a copyright comment that just was due last week so a thought just came to mind and I see you I was just going to mention Brooking Institute actually did a survey uh uh not quite a year ago 20 countries and states uh Global um they actually looked at a coalition model around how Computer Science Education how these specific geographies were able to drive adoption I would say take a look at it it's a Brooking Institute uh recent report I think it's called skills for everyone that and it did this Global survey and Arkansas actually was spotlighted as one that had done in a an effective job of building a coalition uh they were called out in that report so I'm I'm sorry we we got to we got to wrap up here the the countdown is getting pretty tight here and we've got folks but but the good news is um all three of our wonderful panelists are going to be here a little bit after the panel and here throughout the day so please follow up with them on the questions that we didn't get to and even questions that we did that we want to we want to dig into please um help help me thank our panelists Nicole Shena and for doing this panel
