our daily lives are filled with decisions big and small even simple choices like what to wear usually are the result of complex considerations what's the weather going to be like what will you be doing today do you feel like making an impression or keeping it casual but the world around us is constantly changing so we want to adapt the choices we make to match the changing conditions what's true for humans is also true for computer programs we don't want our programs to always run in the same way they should respond to changing conditions in the last video we learned how to use boolean expressions to establish whether something is true or false we can now add something called a conditional statement to help guide the computer's decisions based on that information the simplest conditional statement is an if statement it says that if something is true the computer should run a specific block of code let's say that you want to create a program that displays whether or not you are old enough to see a pg13 movie so the question we want the computer to evaluate is if age is greater than or equal to 13. the question or boolean expression goes next to the if the block of code we want to run only if the condition is true goes inside the if statement so in our example whenever the expression age greater than or equal to 13 is true the program will write to the screen that you are old enough to see a pg13 movie of course some people will not be old enough in these kinds of situations we will want our programs to do something else when the condition is false in order to do this we will want to expand our if statements to include an else statement the commands contained in this else statement only run if the boolean condition in the if statement is false in app lab you can add an else statement by either dragging out the if else block or by clicking the plus symbol in the bottom right corner of the if block sometimes the decisions you will want your program to make have more than two possible outcomes let's continue our movie rating example where we want to check whether the highest rating you can go see alone is an rrated movie a pg13 movie or just a g rated movie to check between these three different cases we can add an else if statement an else if statement is another condition that a program checks only if the previous if statements were false so if age is greater than or equal to 17 right that user can see an rrated movie alone else if the age is greater than or equal to 13 write that the user can see a pg13 movie alone else right that the user can see a grated movie alone the else condition becomes the default condition because when all the previous if and else if statements are false it will default to the else statement be careful as you construct longer sequences of elsif statements if you mix up the order you might not get the behavior you intended in our example imagine we had switched the code so that the first condition checked if the user was old enough to see pg13 movies like this this would mean that everyone who is 13 or older would be told they can only see pg13 movies even the adults and with the next elsift line the computer would be looking for people 17 or older in the remaining group this code misses the adults because they were true in that first condition this won't work the computer checks the conditions from top to bottom so it is important to enter the most specific condition first you
