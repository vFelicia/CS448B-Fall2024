year million students across 170 countries learned an hour of code during Computer Science Education week and that week more girls tried computer science science than in the last 70 years by 2020 there will be 1. 4 million jobs in technology in the US and currently only 18% of students in computer science are female I mean we're half the population so we should be a bigger part of our nation's future don't you think I'm so excited to know that I'm speaking to the next generation of kids that are going to change the world in 2012 when I had an idea to start a safe and healthy lifestyle company I knew the only way to do it was to utilize technology by launching honest you all live in a time where expressing yourself learning about different people making a business and a real difference in your communities is all totally possible with computers it's right at your fingertips I got mine always with me with an hour of code you were given the power to create a lifetime of change and a lot of success I'm honored to be part of the movement to make computer science and mainstain education across the country if we can reach a 100 million students by the end of the year Well at least 100,000 students by the end of the year the future will be a whole lot brighter for all of us so let's stay connected and start coding um now I get the pleasure of introducing someone that makes me really excited to talk about coding every day Stefan Hoffman is not only one of the best coders you'll ever meet um but also one of the coolest he played keyboard and a rock band that tour the country country and he was already a success with a view of his own startups all before he came to work with us um at The Honest Company Stefan is a guy who makes the dreams we have come true daily uh right there on our computer screen sometimes I think he's a magician but I know it's more than magic it's code it's code guys uh thank you Jess for the awesome intro uh I work alongside Jess every day to take her ideas and visions and make those come to life on the computer screen and actually just today we're looking at the honest.com site on a few new things that we're working on and uh there was this little modal window this popup window that really wasn't that great looking um so we thought we could do it a little bit better do something a little bit more on brand so since we're here if you want to jump into some code write a little JavaScript function and get that new modal working that would be fantastic now mind you guys guys I have never written code before I mean I watch him do it all day long and I'm more of the hey that should go over there and what if we try this and how about putting an image versus just some text um and so he knows my style so uh you know we have a shorthand but this is going to be officially my first time like writing actually writing code so the tables have turned yeah all right let's let's dive into it okay so right here is the page and question just a simple newsletter signup and when you click this button you get kind of this ugly popup that we're talking about it's it's really not on brand we want to do something a lot cooler yeah I mean it looks like it's just very standard yeah standard exactly so to make that happen we're gonna H hop over to our text editor right here and here's all the elements that make up this web page we have the all the HTML that has the page it's uh the has the sign up button itself and all the other stuff going on so here's the sign up button right down here we have the new modal window which is all ready to go I called it awesome modal right up here and then we have the Javascript file which is going to make all this stuff come to life and and animate that window on the page so if you want to take the Reigns and go ahead and get started sure I'll walk you through with your first function okay so right now that function is on line three and it says you've signed up and that's it and it's just typed out with that that default alert window that shows up so we're going to delete line three all right we're deleting that perect and we're going to call that new modal window so start off with Dollar Sign dollar sign parenthesis okay and then put double quotes inside the parenthesis okay and now we're going to call that modal element uh hashtag okay awesome Dash modal okay and now modal is just a name for Popup yeah modal is just another name it's kind of like cod speak for Popup window okay so whenever you see a popup window and you click you know on a website or on a video game or an app or anything that's called modal yeah they usually called a modal window okay they're used interchangeably though okay okay so at the end of this right after that last parenthesis do a DOT oh Sor on the outside that's okay okay and write modal again okay parenthesis okay double quotes um double quotes perfect and just write a show inside there all right awesome so the new function looks great I'm just going to save out the page really quick hop over to the web page give it a refresh and if you want to do the honors and hit the sign me up button all right awesome much much better looking a nice lifestyle image yeah bold letters good font and it looks like it's in line with Our Brands it wasn't too bad no no that was like weirdly easy one line so basically learning uh how to code is uh it's sort of like learning another language but it is English somewhat yeah every code's different they all have own different syntax but it's more about kind of math and it's a combination of things right yeah it gets tricky there's there's all kinds of math equations different kinds of functions different Frameworks to to help you do these kind of things have you always been interested in in computer science and coding and was it video games that got you interested in yeah I was I was a big gamer when I was younger but I kind of gave that up to focus more you know on on creating your own I'm actually more of a designer by by trade and uh I've just had to pick up coding um out of necessity to make things work to make my ideas you know come to life and explain them a little bit better right so like as a creative person you can express yourself through coding yeah and you can create your own path to whatever you want to make it's very much like having a canvas and you're the artists cool awesome well I learned something new today now it's time you learn a little more about each other does anyone have any questions George Washington uh Carver Middle School in Springfield Missouri hi is it cold in Missouri right now uh right now it actually is pretty cold it is it's kind of cold here in New York too it just started snowing okay well my my question is uh what was your first exposure to computer science and were you intimidated by it um no I wasn't intimidated by um I think my first real exposure my dad actually was in the military he was in the Air Force and he was in the Personnel depart department and believe it or not he was the IT guy um and back then uh computers were much more simple and I think I only really like played a very simple video game on a computer and it was like a ball that went back and forth and there was like a little line across and you just tried to make it not drop um I don't remember what the name of the game was but I used uh you know in uh as an actress when I was young um I was exposed to it because a lot of um visual effects um are done and utilizing technology and um in computer programs and all of that so that was kind of my first real big introduction to it um and at honest um my first first exposure to like building wireframes and a website and um you know what the customer sees versus the backend technology what you see as a company and data and analytics and all of those types of things in technology uh I was exposed to that for the first time just a couple of years ago um so that you know opened my mind to A Whole New World of possib abilities which is really cool all right uh Frank Conwell Middle School from New Jersey uh City will ask the next question how did you become interested in the technology field and how has impacted your career I became interested in it just as a consumer I mean uh the more advanced uh phones uh and computers got um you know just different devices that make my life easier you know um I if I need a great recipe if I want to read up on a product and I want to know how it works and the functionality of it um to you know really encyclopedia britanica used to be my only source of reference now I Google everything so it really was just purely as a as someone who uses it for daytoday problem solving and then the more I realize the potential like any of you if you know how to code you can create an app you can create a Facebook you can create a Snapchat you can create uh uh uh um video games um what is my daughter interest in into uh what's that first person the oh where you create your own world my daughter's really into this game um ah it's really what what video games do you guys like before I used to W uh play like uh Nintendo which is Minecraft that's what it is my my even my sixyearold is like talking to me about Minecraft so um I don't know it's it's not intimidating as much as it just it just opens people's minds up and there's so much that is possible uh with techn techology and if especially if you can learn how to code um and create uh really you can create anything you want and you can reach everyone in the world which I think is really cool as well you don't have to be born in into a certain type of family or circumstance you don't have to come from a certain neighborhood you don't have to live in an urban or uh a different type of area uh you really can be anywhere in the world and everybody can have access to what you create and I think that's really cool all right our next question comes from uh Bristol Road Middle School in Ontario Canada oh I know Canada's cold I lived there for five years how are you guys doing we see many people in the end credits who have worked on a movie does anyone that works in the movie industry need to know code totally um animate an like basically any animated movie and any CGI and special effects um a a lot of movies I've done have you know people have had to to code in order to turn me into a superhero I mean I wouldn't have been able to do any of the stuff I did as s storm in the Fantastic Four movies um or even in Spy Kids um all that stuff uh with special effects and required coding thanks Jessica um our next question comes from Del delh housy Manitoba Canada another Canadian city hi guys hello oh are they coming in I think so what was your inspiration behind creating The Honest Company my inspiration gosh it really came from two things one is when I was little when I was your age I was really sick and I was in the hospital all the time I had really really bad asthma and allergies and all like almost everything I ate uh would give me these rashes and I would have to go to the hospital and my throat would close um whenever I got a cold it would turn into pneumonia and I had to be in the hospital and um when I had my baby uh six years ago she was born I wanted my baby to not be sick and I wanted to make sure that she didn't have to spend time in the hospital the way that I did when I was little and um when I did research and I found out that all of these things that are in my home from you know what I wash my dishes with to clothes to even shampoos toothpaste everything has these bad chemicals that could make my baby sick and make her have you know allergies and Asthma and things like that so I really created a company because I didn't want her to be sick and I didn't I didn't think any baby should have to be sick or person for that matter so that's why I have so many products um yeah we have diapers and wipes but we do everything from laundry detergent to multisurface sprays to candles even um all using the highest quality ingredients but at an affordable price because a lot of times the healthier products are super expensive and most people can afford them so I wanted to make sure everybody could afford them and everyone can get them and that's why I wanted to create my company and put it online on honest.com because you know doesn't matter where you live whether you're in Canada whether you're in New York City whether uh you're uh really anywhere in the world uh hopefully you'll have access to honest.com right now it's just the United States and Canada but um you know my company's only two almost three years old but in about a year uh we plan on expanding uh overseas thanks Jessica um our next question comes from Bellevue East High School in Bellevue Nebraska hi Nebraska hello um we were wondering what kind of Technologies do you use on a daily basis oh Lord I use my phone on a daily basis it is my brain it's how I speak to my family uh it's how I find my you know restaurants that I want to eat at uh music it's it's um when I'm working out or driving um it's how I communicate on social media um you know I I use also like uh my iPad for recipes and things like that um my kids when we travel uh you know they watch movies on it they play educational games um and then my you know basically my off office I I like to say is is my laptop so I I use all three of my devices pretty heavily on a daily basis um the only problem is when you're in constant communication like that it's hard to shut off um and uh I think that's the only bad thing about technology is you just you're on all the time you're available all the time and uh you're always communicating and sometimes it's nice to rest a little bit um I guess that's what sleeping is for which I don't get a lot of thank you Jessica our next question comes from eer Hill Middle School in Park City Utah hi hi what do you think all students should be exposed to computer science why or why not absolutely um computer science is the future uh if you want to participate in the modern world and where everything is going you have to know uh how to use computers I mean from a presentation uh if you work at any company you need to be able to use your computers and uh and do things digitally um communicating on every level um you you have to have some computer science skills but certainly if you want to compete in a modern world and in the job market basically from today on you have to have computer science skills absolutely all right next question comes from Hobbs Middle School in Milton Florida go ahead do you think your daughters will learn to code and if so how old should they be when they start how old are you I'm 14 what's your name Ashley hi Ashley hello do you know how to code yet Ashley are you gonna learn possibly yes um uh yeah I think my kids should learn how to code absolutely why not I mean it's like why not learn how to do everything that you can um especially if you want to you know have all the opportunities you never know what you're going to want to do in your life when you're an adult when you're 10 you have ideas about it when you're 14 you have ideas about it when you're 20 you have ideas about it but unless you're armed with uh an education and you know uh how to do it it wouldn't it won't even be an option for you um if you want to be an entrepreneur you may when you're 25 or 30 my age when you're old like me you may decide that you want to create and start a company um and you could be inspired by whatever it is in your life and if you know how to code you have the power to do that no matter where you are in the world and that's really cool so I absolutely want my daughters to know uh how to code and and I think it's important for everybody to be armed with that that educ in that information all right the last questions coming from chastang middle school in MOA Alabama Alabama go ahead and ask your question yes learn more computer science what's something you would love to deal with your skills as I learn more what is something I would love to build with my skills um gosh I would love to make uh oh there's so many things right now I'm actually working on um a Beauty company and and uh and it would be cool if I didn't have to inundate poor Stefan with so much work and if I could you know do something uh on my own that would be awesome certainly um making the website you know uh work faster you know how annoying it is when you get that Spinning Wheel while the computer's thinking um you know with code you could actually uh eliminate at that thinking time and you can make things go faster um so that would be something especially with a a company like mine an ecommerce platform um that's what it's called when you sell things on the internet online and your company is online it's called ecommerce um it would be cool if we could make it just really fast so people didn't have to wait for that Spinning Wheel um because that's the bane of my existence right now what would you make if you could do anything with computer science would you make like a cool video game or would you do like a cool app or something cool app what would your app do makeup what do you say make cool that would be awesome um another thing that would be cool is if if if there was an app to tell you how healthy you were like if there was like an app where you could just like put in your information something quick and then it could just say oh you need to you know drink a little bit more water and take like five more walks a day or something and then you'd be healthier I don't know something like that would be neat because I feel like everybody's always getting sick especially now in the winter all right thank you J questions any more questions all right um thank you Jessica for joining us today and answering the questions and sharing about yourself uh interested in technology can everybody give Jessica a warm well uh thank you awesome well if there's no more questions I want to thank you all for letting me spend time with you today and I hope you guys will continue to learn about computer science and coding and use these skills to make your imprint on the world and when you guys get a little bigger I would love to see you come and work at The Honest Company bye bye
