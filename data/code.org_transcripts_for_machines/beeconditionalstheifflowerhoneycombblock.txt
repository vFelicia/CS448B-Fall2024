This is the conditional block. It says if you're at the flower or the honeycomb, then do something. This is useful when we don't know how much honey or nectar to get as we see here with this question mark. In this example, we're going to say, if it's a flower, get all the nectar and then use another one to say, if it's a honeycomb, make honey. Tadah!
