This lesson is functional suncatchers. You'll be creating these pretty suncatchers using functions. There are several steps in creating one of these suncatchers. Some of the steps you have to repeat many times. The first step in simplifying the process of making a suncatcher is figure out what we have to repeat over and over again. We can group these steps into what we call a function. But there is more to creating a beautiful suncatcher than following precise steps. Sometimes we want to be creative and change the color of the beads we're using. We can make every suncatcher unique if we use different colored beads. Your suncatcher will be uniquely yours when you learn to think of the beads as variables which is a word that means a placeholder for information that can change. Have fun creating beautiful suncatchers using functions and variables!
