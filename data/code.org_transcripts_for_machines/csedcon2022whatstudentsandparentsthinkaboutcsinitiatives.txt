my name again if you forgot from just yesterday his is Pat Young praditt and uh I wanted to tell you a little something about me that you might not know I've really only done two things in my career as an adult sure when I was in high school I lifeguarded for a couple years but that didn't count other than that I've only done two things and the two things are teach for 13 years middle school and high school special ed science and computer science not all at the same time and middle school was definitely the hardest and in middle school I taught eighth grade by the way of Middle School eighth grade I don't think was the hardest grade seventh grade was definitely the hardest I remember walking into a seventh grade room yeah so if you're a seventh grade teacher out there bless your heart bless your heart um but I remember walking into a seventh grade classroom to sub just to cover for a teacher at the last second walked in they were the kids were talking I sat down the desk they were just talking they were oblivious they didn't even know I was in there and I just thought oh what if I just don't say anything how how long could this go until they like look at me and are like so is education going to happen um they went on for 30 minutes and you know what I was fine with that because I was just covering for the teacher I didn't care you know what I mean like I was fine with that uh but that that just amazed me and I was like I'm so glad I don't teach seventh grade so I moved to uh the high school at some point and this is actually the very last class I ever taught seventh period AP Computer Science school year 2012 2013 Springboro High School Silver Spring Maryland and uh uh this class uh reflected gosh seven eight years of like like program building for many of you teachers out there for many of you who've been teachers you know what it's like to program build around computer science advocating recruiting students um getting uh administrator buyin um etc etc you know purchasing equipment and so this class really represented um all I was striving for at this school an upper level class that was large this was one of two AP Computer Science classes and at that time we only had apcsa but not only that but students of all different ages races and genders taking computer science it was a beautiful beautiful thing a class that totally represented the school um an interesting note about this class there were a lot of athletes who actually took computer science that year and almost every single athlete was a girl look at that they're they're wearing their uniforms in front so it was amazing a class that really broke stereotypes there was a one particular student his name was Neiman Neiman and I uh connected in on LinkedIn a while ago um and Neiman told me about the things that he was up to and I was super proud of him I just wanted to tell him that hey Neiman I'm proud of you good job and you know he reflected on his experience at uh Springbrook High School and told me that he just really appreciated the computer science classes that we offered there same thing happens all over the nation in the classrooms that you might teach in that you might monitor that you might coach the classrooms that you all might be setting up through your work as a regional organization as a National Organization Etc but really my why in the end has always been kids like Neiman changing their lives I I can't remember if there was a speaker who said something about like saving lives I don't know was that mache I don't know someone talking about how like we're literally kind of like saving lives when we're teaching computer science and I I feel the same way and this is what why I do what I do by the way if you do um get to reach out to people that you've maybe mentored in the past or students that you've taught tell them that you're proud of them it's a very special thing for them to hear that um yeah so today we are going to end our CS edcon experience with a panel about students and so I want to Let's clap thank you I want to bring up to the stage uh our three students uh starting with Jack senovic uh Jack come on up to the stage Jack is from Omaha Nebraska and Jack is a freshman in college right now at a school that you might have heard of it's called um Harvard something like that um Jasmine fields from digital Pioneers Academy Jasmine is in the 10th grade as well as Quran Owens from digital Pioneers Academy as well whom you saw in the Keynote so it's wonderful to bring back students from digital Pioneers Academy they are nervous folks you know how it is so if we could give them one more round of applause so I have committed to providing you all an experience that you've never had before I'm going to try a lot of different things with this student panel and maybe a lot of different things with a panel in general because we want to end off CS edcom with a bang so we're actually going to start with a game you all ready okay this game is called speed round and I have 10 questions for them they're all going to answer the question they're going to answer the question as fast as possible and we're going to try to get through this in 90 seconds okay if they get through it in 90 seconds they will get a prize if they don't get through it in 90 seconds they will get a prize all right you ready I'm ready and let's start the timer favorite recreational activity ping pong basketball soccer who inspires you my mom my mom as well artists musicians invisibility or the ability to read minds read minds read minds invisibility favorite season fall ball fall place you most want to travel to New Zealand Japan Korea is it wrong for a vegetarian to eat animal crackers no no no fill in the blank computer science is awesome great informative last song you heard or downloaded Dynamite frame of mind beautiful days all right uh last Halloween costume vampire uh Ninja Turtle I do not remember you don't want to say that's that's what it is actually all right and this last question we have the time now we got through nine so I'm going to take them a time with this because they don't even know what question I'm going to ask funniest face you can make I I I can't Quran all right all right thanks okay give them a round of applause many seconds to spare good job good job so um uh we're gonna ask some questions and we're gonna start off with Quran and Jasmine uh Quran and Jasmine we learned a lot about your school digital Pioneers uh yesterday uh what is your favorite thing about the school don't worry uh your your principles right there but just pretend that she's not there all right okay uh my favorite thing is to be able to experience computer science like every day because like as you go more and more into like how common it is around you you get to like further appreciate the fact that you could potentially manage any technology that from now in the future that's cool thanks Quran uh I guess I like how it was the main Computer Science Focus school that I saw first and how interactive the teachers are with the students cool all right and uh Jack you know you were recommended for this panel because of your service organization can you tell us more about it yeah so my service organization I cofounded in 2019 called just imagine and since then we've advocated for stem and social emotional learning and in particular we've focused on CS as that's a big part of stem and CS legislative advocacy all right thank you Jack that's really cool uh what was it called again just just imagine just imagine okay just imagine very good uh thank you for that help in Nebraska um If You Don't Know Jack was uh super helpful in getting uh that graduation requirement passed in Nebraska he even um focused on a lot of the what were they senators or Representatives that had maybe were not seeing how important it was or there are certain challenges yeah so our group organized a conference back when this bill was being considered earlier in the year and we talked with state senators especially ones who would vocalized opposition for the bill and really tried to help them understand from a student perspective why CS education is so important for us and why we feel and are so excited now that Nebraska has made CSA graduation requirement oh so uh Jack I know uh you told me that you had a question for Quran and Jasmine actually so you want to ask it yeah I'd love to so cron and Jasmine I'm wondering my school didn't have as many computer science classes as yours in high school and so I'm curious what's that been like taking so many computer science classes and have you enjoyed it well having so many like for such a long time like it gives you more experience of course into like how your livelihood and like understanding computer science would be and it's definitely a good opportunity for jobs and to be employed uh I would say that it's I don't know I guess it's pretty good having like multiple years of Cs because it helped me realize like how much Tech is involved in everything than what I thought it was before awesome awesome um you know I actually do have a surprise another surprise up my sleeve here folks I told you this would be the most nontraditional student panel you've ever seen when was the last time you saw students with their parents right on a panel right so you know what we are going to bring up uh Quran and Jasmine's parents uh so I want to introduce Simone Scott karon owens's mom so Simone Scott and as well Latonya Fields Jasmine's mom you know what's interesting um both Latonya and Jasmine uh sorry Latonya and Simone were talking about this very thing the fact that uh parents voices uh need to be heard and I know that I was in a session yesterday as well and you're out there somewhere and someone mentioned to me oh yes that's right it was a round table discussion that parents it was uh kalista Chen from reboot representation saying that you know uh we need to hear more from parents so I thought you know what I think uh I think we can arrange that uh so let me ask these parents something um can you tell me a little bit more about where you all are from and your neighborhoods let's start with Simone uh yes so we reside um in Ward seven and eight uh their education is actually in Ward six but we reside in seven and eight and in our district that is the most underserved and um communities um and so our communities are definitely plagued with uh gun violence juvenile suicide and um homicide as well so uh that is definitely a part of our community in everyday life yeah thank you Simone Latonya to piggyback on what she's saying because I am from Ward 8 and the same thing that's plagued and Ward seven is also a part of Ward 8. the challenges is just being able to comfortably get up leave home to go to work and trusting that when my child gets up my child is making it safely to school and back at home and if I can uh piggyback on that I believe that it's important to understand and hear the numbers um the wealth Gap in our communities from a Caucasian family to an AfricanAmerican family is 68 000 plus um that is excruciating difficult um to come from above that not only that but Ward seven and eight are the least funded within our entire budget of District funds we only receive about four percent of the total budget um and so for us just getting our kids to school is a challenge we do not have accessibility to Quality education east of the river and so we have what is called the lottery and so we have the option to um almost like a weight listing type of thing to get our kids to Quality education and so therefore they actually have to be Bust or transported from our communities into other communities in order to even gain the opportunities thank you for giving us that context that's really important um for those who don't know the DC Washington DC is split into multiple wards Awards one through eight Wards seven and eight are east of the Anacostia I believe yeah so there's Anacostia River Ward seven eight uh otherwise known as southeast DC um uh Simone and Latonya why did you choose a computer science Focus school for your kids the main important thing that I found as a parent was to listen to my child although I had my own ideas and thoughts about what my goals were for him I thought it was important to enrich him with what he actually wanted to do and so seeing how immersed he was with computer science and how much he thrives off of it I felt that it was important to provide that stability and that opportunity to in order for him to truly maximize his uh Limitless potential and at that time we were also facing home security and so I wanted to ensure that we found a stable home for him not just to thrive but to also graduate and for him DPA is our school thank you thank you Tanya I chose DPA because of the principal Miss Ashton absolutely when I first met Miss Ashton when she was promoting the school the biggest phrases or information that she shared with us was that I and my staff are going to know your kids personally by name and you cannot tell me a lot of these schools and these teachers and administrators know their kids by name but miss Ashton does the teachers there know the kids about name they know the kids personalities they know the parents of the kids and that also is what sold me as well for DPA right yeah I'm sorry and if I may I the one thing that also was serving the whole child that was important especially for at that moment for us um I wanted to make sure that Not only was he enriched with the things that he needed um and lacked but I also got an opportunity to have resources provided to me in order to be better in a position to support and help him yeah that's powerful you know that's that's just reality right it's not just about the students about the whole family um and so awesome to have a school like DPA in that Community um I have a question for all three kids this is for all three of you I want you to imagine a kid in your school University freshman and let's imagine for Quran and Jasmine a kid in your neighborhood who doesn't go to DPA but they they could take a computer science class at their school they're lucky enough to have a computer science course in their school um what would you say to these colleagues these kids to get them to try their first computer science experience Jack I think I would say I mean one thing is obviously learning computer science you'll learn coding but I think there's some not so obvious things that you'll learn like the problem solving and creative thinking and really that's so important for students to learn so I would tell them that I'd tell them to you know someone might think you should only take computer science if you're interested in a Tech Career but right now computer science is so important for so many different careers and it's becoming really widespread in the ways that computer science and technology are applied in different careers in our everyday lives so I think understanding just the increasing importance of computer science would also help students give them that extra push to take a computer science class okay now before we go to Quran and Jasmine now that was a good answer Jack I can't imagine you giving that to another what 18 year old or 19 year old you probably say it in a different way right at University I don't know maybe though okay all right all right Quran Jasmine I want you to literally imagine another 10th grader in your neighborhood same age what would you say to them normal human words normal kid words uh I'd say just like there's so many interesting things in computer science that aren't like I feel like people think of computer science as just sitting down staring at a black screen full of text and just typing sometimes it's not just that there are so many departments and different small parts that you could introduce someone to and not just the coding part and maybe people will get interested when they learn the more various field there thanks Cara thank you Jasmine I also excited to just try it out and see if they like it because I don't think I could force somebody to do it I don't know I'll probably show them some YouTube videos that I watched the people like coding stuff into video games that I play so you said show them videos that you've seen and talk about video game setups is that what you said yeah like people coding stuff into video games I play like mods and stuff so you watch videos of people coding video games is this how do you know that okay look okay I didn't know this was a so first off just a couple years ago I didn't know it was a thing to watch other people to watch videos of other people playing video games all right yeah now Jasmine is telling me that there's a such thing of such a thing as watching other people code watching videos of other people code video games wow okay all right okay I gotta get with the time maybe one thing I'll add on to is I think computer science is so intimidating and I've even seen people who don't want to take it because they think they're not capable of it so I think one last thing is just tell students you know like you got this it's okay to try something new and you've probably got the support in place and your Educators want you to succeed so yeah okay thank you Jack parents the same thing imagine another parent a parent obviously that doesn't have a kid at DPA and they're in some other high school and there is probably some hopefully some opportunity to learn computer science at the high school what would you say to the parent to get them to get their kid to take their first computer science experience question would be why not you know I feel that a lot of the times we found ourselves within the compounds of things that we feel limit us um or what Jack was saying things that intimidate us or Pro maybe take a glimpse of our insecurities and a lot of what I was saying as far as like the deficit of that academic and wealth Gap that plays a part in parents as well um I know for me really quickly it was difficult at some point for me to do help quran's homework because I was like um and so I found it was important I started to go to the school and start asking the teachers like do y'all do like parent tutoring because I can't I don't know if his homework is right I don't know so but what I will tell a parent is if you want your child to succeed like you say you do then why not give them that opportunity to do just that and I think that they will surprise themselves and surprise you too okay thank you Simone Latonya um it's a breach for me it's a bridge that is from yesterday to the event we are sitting at today for what we take from today and use for tomorrow so I think having computer science in every school no matter what the financial obligations may be the challenges with the verbiage of words when it comes to computer science because that word computer science is intimidating yeah we were talking about that before it's very intimidating and it makes a person think well how much is included in this how much will I be able to obtain how much of it am I going to really use so instead of just keeping their book text you have to take your book text and combine it with the actual product and once the kids start seeing the product of it then there's C hey this isn't as bad as I thought it was now I can see I could code this particular program so I can make this robot do this yeah so being able to take the books put them down or lay them side by side by building of a a robot and then they see the end product bring them together and then they won't be so intimidated yeah yeah give it give her a round of applause I I actually I want to connect this that that uh point to what I heard yesterday on the State Chiefs panel I think one of the State Chiefs said uh all you have to do is bring them to an elementary school classroom and show them like computer science happening like an in an unplugged way uh and that's a great way to get people on board as well that kind of HandsOn learning can I just say one more thing please miss Moshe showed us that when we first met her in school yes because she had an actual robot there for the kids to see that she and some of her other students have actually put together that's actually funny you say that because that I remember that all of the kids are surrounded by the table they had just the robots they had all type of just electronics for the kids and I just saw them like light up it was just like it was amazing and so to piggyback off of that while we have your attention I was just like to say that I would love to see computer science as the platform to provide whole services not just for the child but for the family as you are asking and seeking for funding and as Jack has his uh business as well as the initiative for computer science being a requirement for graduation I feel that a way to gain more engagement is to meet not just the child where they are but to meet the parent where they are and a lot of the times I just what she was saying as far as intimidation it goes for the parents as well just hearing the word computer and then science connected to that it can in a sense make a lot of people in communities like ours question if they are even eligible if it if they're even able to do that and so just hearing the terms makes them feel as though that is something that just doesn't qualify for them and I feel that if you gain more awareness and connection to that I think that you will again to see a lot more parents invested in this particular initiative okay thank you yeah thank you you um I uh I know that Quran actually had a question for the audience yes so get ready Quran needs to plan his future and so he wants your help and so we have four mic Runners out there all you have to do is raise your hand and you can answer quran's question and we can take a couple answers to quran's question brief brief answers Quran what's your question for the audience uh as I prepare for my future by enhancing my UCS skills what is a key piece of advice I could get to make sure I'm more successful later on and I can't see so uh Mike Runners you'll just give it to someone they can just keep start talking all right I got it um hey Quran uh first of all very impressed by all you all and proud of you um computer science can go a lot of different ways in a lot of different places over here other side other side all right [Laughter] there he is computer science go a lot of different places um there's a word in in Japanese I think it's ikigai it says find something that um uh will pay you well is connected to things you're passionate about is of service to your community um what's the fourth name but another fourth one I forget but find a place where computer science meets those those multitude of goals not just you know I'm going to go programming to make some money find things are also services to your community and something that you're connected to and passionate about awesome thank you our other advice Keep It Coming okay I got one over here hi so uh having taught computer science for a very long time my advice to you is remember that the ideas at the heart of computer science are there because they work to help you overcome difficult things so don't forget persistence not just computer science all things in life learning from failure all things in life trying something even if you don't know yet if it's right all things in life so the skills that you're learning that are helping you create these programs and these things that no one else has done because they came from your brain they will also help you create programs and things and companies and wealth and all sorts of things that you might not have known to try but you can if you have those skills thank you I'm out over here uh I think this is applicable across the spectrum of life in general I've always been a no is not the right answer person somebody presents you with an opportunity say yes because those opportunities then can lead to other opportunities so don't sell yourself short even if you're unsure of something keep persisting love that word uh and moving forward and and don't say no uh to these opportunities that could just enrich your own life not just careerwise but just lifewise thank you thank you Sean we're gonna actually I Know Jack you had uh some advice for Quran as well that you wanted to give right yes of course yes so I think earlier we talked about just how college is different from high school and computer science and one thing I'll say right off the bat is I think that you're going to be so prepared for computer science and college both of you just having so much computer science coursework that's amazing and I think you know college can be really intimidating it can be scary but I think as long as you know you're you put in that effort you utilize the resources around you you're going to do so well so you got this I think what's up what's on your way wait I saw I saw you put the mic to your mouth I was saying thank you oh okay thank you yeah and actually let me just say right quick and then I'm gonna get off here because mothers can't help but give advice right LaTonya I'm not giving advice um just saying thank you for this opportunity absolutely to be a part of this experience for CS actually I was gonna I was gonna ask you two parents the same thing but I'll ask it to all the students so far because they've actually you know they've attended some sessions they've saunted around this is a very new experience for kids the fact that adults like get together to like plot and scheme about about how to get more kids like you to take computer science it's probably like what I didn't I didn't know this was a thing so my question for all you all is like what do you think about the CSI con experience so far what do you think about csed con these folks getting together the sessions that you've attended Jack you want to start sure I mean I definitely will take the photo weather over the Boston weather but you know besides that besides that I've really loved it I've been able to meet so many incredible people and hear about so many different ideas within computer science and education that I really hadn't heard before and that's been so exciting to me so thank you so much for the invite it's really been an honor cool uh I think it's been really cool to just come and uh hear what you guys have to say about it and make decisions about it so yeah I just think it's neat thanks Johnson it's a good experience to like get to have some sort of like dive into the future and what I'll be doing so getting used to it will is a good part of it thanks Quran parents this is an amazing experience um because as an Engaged parent just being able to see um what he's been doing what you guys are doing uh in DPA with our Scholars they had an opportunity to connect with you guys over the summer and for me uh having you guys were able to get legislative here that's impressive so that's amazing but just having a room full of individuals who are for the same goal is amazing and also to hear more about what you guys have planned for our kids but essentially for me as quran's question is just how do I support him more effectively and proficiently and with that I was able to gain a lot more with that but most importantly is what does his future look like and what can that look like for us despite where we come from or what our daily challenges are um and what does employment or business ownership uh look like for our kids um and I know we're in DC we have something like the Marionberry uh summer youth program and so I would love to see more of you guys um holding spaces like that and all of our communities for all of our Scholars so thank you yeah thank you very well said I don't think I can top that you're so crazy I don't think I've been tough that you really don't okay so I'm gonna try to top that but what I can say is I really appreciated being able to sit in the audience to be a part of this event but to get to hear other cities challenges and how they've overcome them and so that way we can also take that back to DC to help with our families and the scholars and soon to be programmers and designers and what manufactures and next Google personnels and everything like that but just remember you can also do some internships and come to DC yes students from DC you know to help broaden their range and spectrum of the Cs world thank you thank you okay so we're gonna we're gonna continue rolling with this theme of uh focusing on you all uh you know specifically in the audience we have curriculum and professional learning providers in fact let's let's do an experiment here raise your hand if you are involved in the creation of curriculum okay and raise your hand it could be the same person if you're involved in providing professional learning in some way okay a whole lot of people okay so you're gonna you're basically speaking to the entire audience here uh the question for you all uh panelists what would you want to tell the people who write the lessons your teachers use to teach you with and train your teachers what do you what would you want to tell them what what advice you want to give them what recommendations what do you want from them anyone can start okay perfect I guess first of all I just want to say thank you what you're doing is so important and really for students like us we're so appreciative of what you're doing so thank you so much I think I would say two things so first of all as far as the teacher training I think one of the most important things in any computer science classroom because it can be so intimidating for students is just a supportive environment so considering the big picture the social emotional learning aspect of computer science I think is really crucial I think the second thing would be especially somewhere like Nebraska where there isn't as big of a technology focus and especially in rural areas it can be harder for students to see computer science in their lives ever it might feel sort of distant and so I think showing students the applications of computer science not just in Tech but really in everyday life and how many careers in areas use computer science is something that might be really helpful to help students in their curriculum make computer science feel more personal to them in less system thank you Jack Jasmine uh uh I don't know just make it more fun um I'd say it's very important to keep the work that we're doing more like yeah just make it fun so that no one has to feel like they're doing a job or like they're being forced to do something and for the teachers just make sure you're liking what you're doing we don't no one none of us want to do anything we don't want to so just yeah help the teachers like what they're doing yeah we all want teachers like that that's true Quran uh let's uh let's give them all round of applause and and let's end with the parents answering the same question what would you like to tell the curriculum providers and the professional learning providers curriculum based make it less technical with words make it so that it's transparent between the student and yourself they will learn the technical as they Advance on but first started off with transparency and break it down to the level which they're understanded thank you Latonya thank you uh really quickly I would just say again thank you um this is very important for our family for everyone who's sitting up here and I think that incoherently we're speaking for parents who are not even here and I feel what I will leave you with is again addressing the whole child understanding that the policies and legislative processes that you're putting on the table you have to it goes a little bit beyond computer science Jack was talking about something as far as a social emotional learning that's important our kids need that when it comes to mental health our kids need that when it comes to having more resources and I know mache was speaking about that allowing these professionals some who may be retired having them come back and help the teachers so that it's not so much for the teachers responsibilities to do to everything but give them some leeway and some room to to breathe okay um and to to ignite that passion because I feel like when teachers are overwhelmed their stressed they are using their own resources to fund things as well as getting to know each child and everything that's going on with the families I just think it's important that you see all of the full spectrum of what you guys are doing not just computer science because the other um things are important as well in order for us to just close some of the gaps that are happening with our Scholars and with our communities thank you thank you thank you Simone um let's give them another round of applause if I could have a gift uh so I you know they did they passed the test of the speed round so students I do have uh some gifts for you uh we also have some special gifts in there from our friends at ROBLOX wow yeah um so we wanted to give that to you and I just I knew you were going to look at it yeah I just want to say thank you again thank you again thanks all thank you thank you thank you
