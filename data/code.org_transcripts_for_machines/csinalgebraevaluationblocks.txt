You'll be learning to use a programming tool called evaluation blocks to write mathematical expressions. Let's look at the evaluation block for addition to see how it works. First you'll see the name that describes what the block does at the top. Here it's a plus sign. Then underneath that, the inputs that the block needs. When we evaluate the block, we start from left to right. Here's how we would use it to program the computer to add 1 and 2. In the next stage, you'll see a simple arithmetic expression in the bottom of the play area. Your goal is to replicate that expression with the evaluation blocks. When you click run, you'll see your code evaluate stepbystep in the play area. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
