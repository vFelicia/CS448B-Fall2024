let's say we're cleaning up and have a stack of plates to put away in our kitchen cabinet as long as there is at least one plate in the stack we have to continue putting plates away we're repeating a task as long as the condition is true we can use a control structure to repeat a task like this a control structure is a condition or iteration statement which affects the flow of a program an if statement is an example of a control structure that checks the condition only once we need to add an iteration statement to check more than once an iteration statement is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code java has a few ways we can write an iteration statement one way is using a while loop a while loop is a control structure which executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is true let's use a while loop to put away our stack of plates first we write the keyword while in an open set of parentheses inside the parentheses we will specify the condition let's call a check for plate method as our condition if the condition returns true let's execute some code that puts the plate away for instance put plate away as long as there are plates in the stack the while loop runs again and again and again once there are no more plates in stack check for plate will return false and the program will exit the while loop with while loops we can repeat tasks as long as the condition is true while loops help simplify our programs so we don't have to rewrite the same code repeatedly you
