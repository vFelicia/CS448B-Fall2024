we have used loops to repeat tasks like putting away plates until there are no more left in a stack we are repeating a task as long as the condition is true we can also use recursion to repeat a task like this recursion is when a method calls itself in recursive methods there is a base case and a recursive case the base case is the condition when the recursion should end and return a value the recursive case is the point when the method should call itself let's use recursion to put away our stack of plates we can write a method called put awayplate to represent the task that we want to repeat it has a parameter to represent the number of plates in the stack the base case is if there are no plates left in the stack we can use an if statement to check if numplates is equal to zero if this is true we'll print a message saying that we're finished the recursive case is if there are still plates left in the stack when the if statement is false the method will call itself with one less plate in the stack as long as there are plates in the stack the method will keep calling itself with one less plate once there are no more plates in the stack the if statement returns false and the recursion ends repeating a process like this can be done using either loops or recursion
