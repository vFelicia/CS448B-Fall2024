welcome everybody my name is melissa jones i am a community manager here at code.org and i'm going to be your hostess this evening for our webinar tonight we're talking about how we increase access to cs education all across the united states what's working and what doesn't um we're using a platform called blue jeans for this webinar tonight blue jeans is a really great online communication platform but there are a couple things to keep in mind you can see us and hear us but we can't see or hear you so if you have a question or something that you'd like to bring up feedback anything you'd like to say the best way to do that is to use the chat window which is right above your webcam picture on the side of the screen if you click that there should be some flashing icons there now if you click that you can see the chat that's already going on and you can also introduce yourself put in your questions and put in your feedback there when um it comes time for q a and for discussion you can use your microphone and your video camera and the way that we are right now and you'll activate those right below your webcam picture um and i'll let you know when it's time to do that so no need to do that now if you do have your microphone on you may want to mute it so that we can reduce background noise so welcome this is the second in a series of five webinars we're going to be hosting this fall um last month we had a special q a session with hadi partovi the founder of code.org and this month we're really excited to have outlier in the house and pat our chief academic officer to talk about the results of our program evaluation i'll talk about the next upcoming webinars in just one second but what i wanted to do is just give you a brief overview of what we're going to be discussing tonight earlier this month code.org released our 20142015 program evaluation report um and so tonight we're going to get some information um about what's in that report and give you a chance to ask us questions about the data about the results about anything that um is striking your fancy after you hear about the results so our presenters tonight are pat youngpity who's the chief chief academic officer here at code.org and dr heather king who is an associate researcher at outlier hello and we're going to start out by telling you a little bit about why we did the evaluation work and what we were hoping to learn then we'll dive into the study design and review the findings pat will share some of our key takeaways from an organizational perspective and we'll have plenty of time for your questions and to discuss the results and really that's what we're mostly hoping to get out tonight out of tonight rather is a real dialogue about this evaluation and what it means not just for code.org but for the entire cs education community so i'm gonna hand it over to pat pat take it away thank you um so hi guys uh and melissa you can um go to the next slide great thank you uh so yes who i am um well i uh i taught for 13 years i'm actually a career educator folks um i uh taught for 13 years k through 12 a little bit of k but mostly middle school and high school and of that mostly computer science i've also taught middle school science as well so i'm a i'm a career educator meaning the information that you're getting from me is coming from a perspective of someone who understands what you guys are doing on the ground um so that's who i am and uh currently right now i uh lead the academic work at code.org and i'm specifically focused on um a project where we're creating a framework for k12 computer science education and working with states all across the nation video coming through but um okay i'm gonna ignore that for now um so what is this about um well this is about what code.org learn and um uh uh through its first um year of implementation 20142015 um so it's about understanding what how teachers um took to our professional development and our partners professional development um what they learned from it um how their attitudes might have uh changed because of it what happened in the classroom because of it it's about understanding what our how our district partnerships went and whether they actually move the needle in districts and how far they move the needle um it's also about understanding what students were learning in the classroom during these computer science experiences and lastly it's about understanding the impact of computer science on other subjects and so why do we do evaluation at code.org one of the things i'm i'm proud of at code.org is that we've been doing evaluations since the beginning even while we were trying to just figure things out folks um we were evaluating it right from the beginning um and for those of you guys who understand agile methodologies in terms of like the software industry or even just any other industry in terms of being agile we were quite agile in uh at the beginning of code.org trying to figure out how we wanted to um spread computer science education all across the nation and having our external evaluator outlier there right from the beginning helped us out a bunch and so it's not just evaluation in terms of judging and assessing the outcomes and um and almost like measuring uh code.org effectiveness it's not that type of evaluation it's more so all about program improvement and that's really uh why this is important why we do evaluation we just want to improve and we just want to meet our goal some people do evaluation because they're into research or they're doing experiments and it's about experimental design and what they find out and how they can inform the research community yes we're about that as well but really we're just about program improvement so that we can meet our goals better and what what it's not about and i just want to be clear about this is funding because none of our funding requires any kind of um external evaluation like we do and so really it's all about program improvement and why is it important for you guys you guys in the field teachers in the field and researchers out in the field for teachers it's about uh well getting better curriculum making sure that it's evidence and research backed so that when you use it with kids it works and for researchers we're studying the same stuff and so we've learned a lot from you and we hope that you can learn a lot from what we've done um and some of the stuff that we've looked at that we can't that we might not be looking at anymore we hope that you you uh take up um the torch and um study it further so that we can in turn benefit so that's the who i am what is this about and why it's important um so what did we want to learn um we wanted to learn a lot uh we we uh had a outlier evaluate all of our programs so i already talked about the the district partnerships i talked about um our professional development um in this in school year 201415 we had i believe five programs happening one let me count no four programs happening um at the elementary school level we had our cs fundamentals program which is actually composed of a number of courses that can be taught at the k5 level some of you guys on the column might actually be using them um uh the second program we evaluated was computer science and algebra which is a middle school program dedicated to integrating computer science into an algebra class for the purposes of learning algebra better we had a computer science in science program and that was the same thing as the algebra program but just for science those two programs just to be clear were actually created and uh run by our external partners folks who had been uh funded by the nsf for a long time and then we also had a program at the high school level called exploring computer science same thing code.org did not create exploring computer science uh it was created by a group called exploring computer science and they've been doing great work for a number of years before we teamed up with them to spread their great work all over the nation those are the programs this is uh what we want to learn let's go on to the next slide yes so i'm going to introduce our external evaluators outlier based out of the university of chicago center for elementary math and science education they are our external evaluator and for those you guys who don't aren't familiar with evaluation in a research setting an external evaluator works is a third party outside of code.org that has um more of a i guess the whole point of it is that they are neutral and um and that they can um look at and evaluate code.org's work uh from an objective standpoint not being um not being the ones who necessarily created the work and are executing on the work i'll pass it to dr heather king from outlier thanks pat i'm really excited to be here first of all i got to come to seattle and actually be physically present to do this and that's very exciting just to give you a little bit of background just like that said i'm from outlier research and evaluation at the university of chicago and we are a group of educators researchers anthropologists scientists artists uh we're very diverse and we have collectively been doing evaluation and research for i don't know how long genie has been doing it uh the director of our group but 20plus years and we've been very excited to work with uh code.org for the past year and a half uh just as pat said we're also very interested in sharing findings and producing very actionable research and evaluation that can be used immediately so working with code.org as nimble and agile as they are is a great fit for us so thanks for having us here and thanks for letting us um present everything that we've done in the past year so i just wanted to go over really quickly some of the um methodology that we use just because i'm going to be referring to that and so you guys can understand what i'm talking about so first of all questionnaires these are surveys so a lot of multiple choice questions that we send out to teachers administrators this year we'll be sending to students also and when you get questionnaire findings you can you have a bunch of uh respondents so in the hundreds maybe your thousands if we're lucky and you can do statistics you can do things like that so you'll see things like you know on average participants rated xyz um five out of six and so that would be something from a questionnaire so when you're looking back at the evaluation report i think we have that url somewhere in here uh and you see something like that that's coming from a survey or a questionnaire we also have interviews so that's when we actually talk to people and we get really indepth stories about what they've been experiencing and so in these in these two methods we're asking a lot of the same types of things so we ask about implementation like what's actually happening in the classroom we ask about attitudes like do you like computer science do you think computer science is important um we talk about their backgrounds and things like that but these are just two different ways of getting the same kinds of information and an interview is great for getting more rich details and really digging into somebody's story so when you look at the evaluation report online you might see quotes and you might see some of this more what we would call quantitative findings so that's just to give you a little bit of context about where those things are coming from okay so now let's get into the findings so we did a number of studies and i'm going to just look at each one of them very briefly because we want to get into your questions later on and if you guys want to look more in depth please go to the evaluation report um i don't know if we can see this but uh melissa has linked this to you guys maybe we can put that in the chat chat for that so that we can um have access to that and that's going to have much more indepth findings i just want to go really briefly over because the studies that we did last year and what some of the major findings were okay so i want to start with the district leaders so code.org was very interested in understanding how their district partners were experiencing a partnership with them what sorts of feedback they might have about the relationship between the district and code.org and then we also wanted to get a sense of where the district was do they have plans in place for uh keeping computer science going over the long term do the people that we're talking with have value computer science do they think it's important things like that and then what's what's the greater community's feelings about computer science education so we wanted to gather all of that kind of information through interviews talking directly with district leaders and we talked with leaders in six regions broward county florida charles county maryland denver new york uh seattle and spokane washington and of course these were district leaders i'm just referring down to this little box in the corner that gives you a little bit about um the study and um who we who we spoke to and what's her grades we're talking about so as we move forward continue to look at that lower corner for that information so just some very high level findings for example uh when we talked to two district leaders we found that while the a lot of the times the individual that we were talking with they found computer science very important but maybe that wasn't shared with others in the district but when code.org came in that definitely increased the priority of computer science in all of the regions so everybody that we asked this question to said that code.org helped make computer science more of a priority in their district another thing that we discussed with them was how funding long term and how things like course credit are decided and almost always it was decided at the state level especially things around course credit and so that was another uh challenge that we all need to be aware of as we try to move towards sustainability of computer science education because sometimes when we're working with districts maybe these decisions are not up to them so states and other stakeholders are also important in these conversations about keeping computer science going over the long term and in that same vein all of the people that we talked with said that community input is very important for keeping computer science education going in the long term for sustaining that because you have industry and business in the community and they have a stake in how students in the local community are educated about computer science the k12 excuse me the higherend organization so universities technical schools community colleges all of those people also have a stake in this so it's not just the schools themselves but it's everything around in the community and so all of those stakeholders need to come together over the long term to help keep computer science education going so if you want to learn more and for all of these that i'm talking about please go to the link that melissa just put into the chat and um yeah so that we can see the detailed findings there for now i'm going to move on to the next study that we did so the next study we did was looking at counselors and administrators so when i say administrators i mean school leaders so that's principals vice principals maybe instructional leaders others at the school who are considered in admin and counselors so these were all looking at high school high school admin and counselors and this was after a professional development the code.org put on for counselors and administrators in a handful of regions so again we have broward county florida boston chicago charles county maryland denver seattle and spokane so code.org held professional development for admin and counselors to get them oriented to what is computer science education in high school what does that look like and what's important about that and we surveyed them after so we asked them questions in a survey and we had 96 respondents and one of the things that we found was that respondents believe that computer science was necessary for high school students so the majority agreed with that but that they felt less strongly that it should be required so that was interesting because it speaks to some of the things that we've found over the years looking at computer science education that people think it's important it's definitely something that people should be doing but when it comes to who should be doing it how should that happen that's where all of these discussions start so this was reflected in this finding that maybe not everybody thought that every single high school student should take computer science but they all felt that it was important and that the pd the professional development code.org provided influenced that so you'll see that in in the full report when you go online and look at that another thing that i thought was really interesting and speaks to uh how quickly computer science is is changing and how quickly computer science education is changing is this idea that a third of respondents so 29 didn't feel that they had the resources necessary in the district to teach computer science courses so we didn't specify in the questionnaire what we meant by resources but we were talking about physical resources maybe they meant computers or curricula or space or teachers and because this was a brief survey we didn't get into all of the details but through the other things that we've done and the people that we've talked to not just for the code.org evaluation but for other studies on computer science education we've found a lot of different reasons that administrators might not feel that they are their schools are prepared to teach computer science so this is another issue to the field how can we address that okay i'm going to move on to the next study so the next study looked at the implementation of the cs fundamentals courses so again these are the k5 courses there are currently four courses one of them course four is in beta but uh we've talked to teachers all over the country so not just in those regions that i talked about before but all over the country everybody that we could get to to respond to us basically we asked them both via questionnaires and via interviews we did 15 interviews with teachers across the country and we surveyed about 700 plus elementary school teachers so we found a lot of different things there's quite a bit more in the online report so please go there to see more but some major findings that i just kind of skimmed off the top where teachers for example were very challenged by the fact that multiple grades you use each course so like i said there's four courses course one is intended currently for kindergarten and first graders course two for uh second and third and course four for um fourth and fifth grade and then we have this course four that i think was intended to be advanced and to be used by others that had gone through everything else but when we were talking to some of the elementary school teachers they were a little unsure about how to how to approach that because if you have students um in a mixed class or if you have a technology facilitator even who sees lots of different kids from lots of different grades they were needing to adjust their instruction based on the kids they had in front of them and so a kindergartner and a first grader are very different as i'm sure most of you or all of you know so they were having trouble using the same materials for different for different types of students so that was one thing that we brought back to code.org another thing that we learned from the study was that the codaughter courses were very interesting to kids so all of these things that code.org has built in like the frozen characters like the flappy birds angry birds all that stuff kids were just really jazzed to be getting on code.org and they felt like it was a game and that's exactly what the intention was so hearing that and hearing some of the stories from teachers too about which students were engaged and which students were interested so it wasn't just the high achieving students it was sometimes there was a story that i i remember from a teacher about um a student who was very struggled a lot with reading and struggled a lot with literacy and was considered to be kind of one of the lower kids in the class but when it came to the programming and with the code.org lessons he was like at the top like he just got it he was figuring stuff out he was helping other kids and um that's a really good thing to know about which which sorts of kids are being reached by the code.org materials because as we all know this is a big goal of code.org is to get every kid involved so not just the high achieving goods another thing that we found was talking not just to teachers about the materials and how the kids were reacting to them but also the teacher training and now that teachers had had a bit of a chance to go through the materials what did they need what did they need to do this better so um as as i'm sure most of all of you know there isn't a lot of teacher training out there for computer science and the elementary grades so teachers had some challenges they wanted some more content support and they were very excited and grateful for the pd provided at the beginning of the year but as you go through and you know when you're in front of the kids you're in the classroom you need to figure some stuff out and you might you know things are coming up that you didn't anticipate so that was one piece of feedback that we got was that more content support would be great and there's some other pieces of feedback to you um that are in the online longer version of this okay so moving on to the high school courses so pat mentioned exploring computer science this is a curriculum that's out of california and there's been a group that has been developing this and implementing this and high schools down there for i believe six or seven years now so code.org partnered with them to bring this set of instructional materials to kids nationwide at the high school level and this is a very introductory course and it's intended to be focused on bringing high school students up to speed in terms of what is computer science what does that mean and then you get tastes of programming data all of these different fundamental computer science concepts so what we found in our other studies not just with code.org was that a lot of high schools teachers tend to pull together pieces of information to kind of build their own curriculum so that was one thing we're really interested in learning is do teachers even like teaching this way with a set of instructional materials that's all one thing it's complete and we found that they did a surprise especially since i think more than half of teachers that we talked to and again this is questionnaires and interviews and in the questionnaire i think 55 had never taught computer science before so i believe that this wasn't help to them so teachers like teaching computer science with a complete set of instructional materials like ecs uh with that said fewer than a quarter of responds were able to finish each unit of ecs and the time that it said it would take in the materials so not sure exactly what's going on and it's probably different in each case and of course it probably always takes longer to finish than the curriculum says but that's um something that we noted in the evaluation and another thing that we were really interested in this year was assessment because pat mentioned uh figuring out what students learned and that's something that we're going to look at in much more depth in this year's evaluation but we were really interested in understanding how teachers were trying to understand what their kids were learning so we asked a number of questions about assessment and only a quarter of respondents were totally confident in their ability to assess student learning and if you look at the long version of the report there's quite a bit more in there about the types of assessment that they used um the different you know avenues that they were trying to follow to get at student learning and then we have a bank of quotes directly from teachers in us in a survey we ask them to write out some of their concerns with assessment so that's in there too for you guys to look at and so um again go back to the longer report this is just like very high level um and i'm i believe that's the last slide for me and i'm really looking forward to getting your guys's questions in the chat pod when we get to that point because i really want to hear what you guys think and what questions you have and that can help us as we move forward with the evaluation too great and so just for folks who are watching the recording after the fact you can access these reports at code.org about evaluation or you can access the full report that heather is referring to at outlier.uchicago.edu evaluation underscore code org those are in the slides as well you'll see them throughout but just wanted to make sure people who don't have access to the chat pod get that um we did have one question that came up during your chat there heather if you want to address it now you can wait till later so grant would like to know in looking through the data that we have on professional development which was the first slide that you talked to 97 of the teachers that were surveyed um said that they felt prepared to teach code.org curriculum and actually i think this is from a study that you guys actually didn't conduct for us but maybe you could speak to the methodology grant wants to know um is that immediately at the end of the training did you follow up later around implementation how did you guys handle that in your study design yeah so i believe that 97 figure comes from a survey that was implemented or you know put out right after the training and so um i think that that's where that's coming from and that was what i was getting at when i was talking about the content support and other support that teachers named and how when you get in the classroom you know you feel super confident and that's so important because selfefficacy is so important for for teachers and and that is a predictor of success in other areas for sure so that's very important but as we all know when you're in the classroom and stuff's happening um and you're not an expert you know that that content needs to come in somewhere so so i guess to answer your question grant the 97 is right after and then when we asked later on after the school year uh was pretty much done we asked a similar question i'm just looking at the long report now to see if we have um an exact figure but uh the level of agreement dropped off and i think that that makes a lot of sense because this is a brand new thing like this has only existed for a year and again these elementary school teachers probably don't have a lot of experience with computer science that's something else that we that we asked about yeah and one thing i really liked about the evaluation design is we're collecting um immediately after this after the pd workshop is over how do you feel and people are feeling great in gungho and then we came back later with both surveys and interviews to get the real deal you know once implementation was going on so in the in the full report online you'll see um results of immediately after the pd workshop and then the implementation reports that point to what's happening during the school year yeah so i think when you look at our the outlier reports those are all of the things that happen after the fact and then i think some of the things on the code.org website like that 97 that is actually code.org data on the day of on the day of and so i'm just looking at the longer report now and it says that more than half of questionnaire respondents so that's 55 someone disagreed or disagreed that they had all of the skills needed to teach computer science well so that's that difference after they've had a little bit of experience and i don't think that's necessarily bad i think that that just means that this is new and it's new to the teachers and that they need more support and i don't think that's a big surprise yeah the gap that we're finding is in their content knowledge too which is a hard thing to be fought uh okay i'm unmuted yeah uh i'll just add that um so the the question uh grant that was asked of these teachers is you know are they how you know i um i feel prepared to teach this course and then um they rate their agreement right um on a scale um and then the question asked uh later by outlier uh relates to um them having the skills needed to teach computer science well so slightly different questions where you know you know do i feel prepared and then at the end of their experience or somewhere towards the end of their experience actually in the classroom do i have all the skills required so nonetheless it's not a surprise that they feel you know really excited and they they think they feel prepared but then afterwards they find out that they're actually missing a lot and thus a lot of the a lot of the um recommendations that outlier made based on their interviews are around different content supports um ways to integrate the computer science content with the math the science the english language arts content that these elementary school teachers are already covering um a full course progression with more materials um lots of other stuff to help them feel more confident in the classroom hope we hope we address your question grant and please do continue to put questions in the chat pod we're going to have a specific portion of the agenda just for q a but we can of course pop in like this as well oh here is that url if you are not if you don't have access to the um chat room if you'd like to see the full report so we're gonna go back to cat now oh go ahead pat yeah you can go back to me actually go to the next slide melissa and and actually grant's having a great conversation about this uh i don't know who grant is but i think grant knows i think grant knows about professional development so this grant mentioned that for people on the video who can't see the chat grant mentioned that it sounds like um more followup pd is needed for these teachers and that's very true so i just want to point out that the k5pd is one day in person and there is no chance that an elementary school teacher who's never had a computer science experience has no computer science degree no computer science background has never taught computer science and might not have ever learned computer science ever in their life will be a um will be actually fully prepared they could feel fully prepared but being actually prepared which is what outlier asked is a totally different thing so follow pd guaranteed um and uh and folks like flavia who use the mickey makey and scratch and logo and lots of other things are kind of almost getting into it themselves which is wonderful um the the code.org pd is not meant to be a full solution it's meant to really spark um the growth of a uh of a of a novice computer science teacher but it's not supposed to be an endall beall so followup pd is definitely definitely needed um so yeah let's talk about more pd um so you see these uh results here um and you might be wondering what these two columns for k5 affiliate train and k5co.org trained are all about um well so in the beginning um and i told you guys we were very agile organization meaning we were very open to change and changing as we were executing on things as well well in the beginning we were thinking that we would run all of our k5 professional development ourselves so with our own code.org trainers um we quickly decided that we wanted to try something different and work with an affiliate model which meant that we um contracted with a number of people all across the nation and trained them to train teachers so it's like a train the trainer model if you're familiar with that and thus the difference between the 176 features that code.org trained personally and the k5 affiliate trained teachers 9290 that was as of june 2015 um the k5 affiliate trained teacher number is now currently hovering close to 15 000 teachers which is quite amazing thank you to all of our k5 facilitators out there including alana aaron who's in the chat room right now these teachers out there who have fulltime jobs have on their you know in their free time um feed hundreds and hundreds of teachers themselves adding up to a total of 15 000 teachers so that's quite amazing um and you're going to see in this chart that you're looking at right now in this slide that the professional development that code.org and its partners run is very well received um the lowest numbers you see here are in blue this was the best pd ever that's kind of um it's not the silliest question we ask but it's it's it it could seem kind of weird to you guys really the whole point of that was to you know people could be satisfied with the professional development but we wanted them to compare it to all the professional development they've ever had um and so the question was you know this was the best pd ever and they they answered that question on a scale of one to six they they expressed their agreement with that statement on a scale of one to six so um that's why you see those low numbers is because um uh you know it's a pretty strenuous high bar to reach best pd ever um so yeah so i mean this this chart right here is really just to show you that the the pd has been very well received i'm just going to call out one more thing before i move on to the next slide which is what else happened in the classroom in terms of the k5 program teachers interviewed said that student enjoyment of computer science and data showing student learning would be the most influential factors in them deciding to teach computer science so basically if their students enjoyed it and there was actually data showing that students were learning um they would teach computer science that would convince them to teach computer science and so we're working on both of those uh fervently increasing the enjoyment factor when it comes to computer science and also making visible the data showing student learning and so we've actually hired a data engineer since this last report came out a data engineer as well as an internal uh learning scientist to help us um uh improve the student learning outcomes for all of our programs let alone the k5 program let's go on to the next left and i'm going to go a little bit quicker here guys because heather already gave a great overview of these um of these areas of evaluation but i just wanted to kind of just chime in so district partnerships um co.org partners with a number of districts nationwide it was uh like 60 or 70 um as of june 2015 and now it's i don't know close to um 100 or or something like that i don't know it's on our website or something real really the point is is that uh we are addressing the issue of computer science education from the bottom and the top where the top here is at the district level creating course codes uh making sure that um there's someone kind of leading the charge in the district it's not just teachers all by themselves figuring out how to teach computer science and where to get computer science resources and how to fund their own professional development um and so that's really what the district partnership is all about um one thing that i want to call out i can't remember if heather called it out is sustainability um heather did you call talk about sustainability okay yeah so hey guys so this district partnership stuff it doesn't mean anything if um it doesn't lead to uh sustainable programs of computer science and so that's another reason why we engage the district in the first place because guess what if a teacher teaches computer science and kids are having a good time and the teacher leaves well then there's no more computer science so it has to really be institutionalized at the district level um and so we have plans to help districts make their programs and the effort that code.org has put in more sustainable and that's uh that's yet to be seen obviously because we'll we'll know whether we were successful three to five to seven years from now but we're definitely focused on that um next slide student learning outcomes okay so take a look at this slide folks this is about student learning outcomes but what you're seeing in this graph this table is just participation and i want to make clear that participation does not equal student learning big numbers does not equal kids actually learning computer science it just means accounts are created and they're doing something and what we have studied if you look at our website and click on the learn more under the student learning outcomes section we have studied students demonstration of certain concepts concepts like debugging sequencing loops conditionals nested loops etc our next step is to show actual learning and mastery because even demonstration of a concept is not necessarily learning learning requires an understanding of where they were before and where they are at the end of the treatment and so we're doing a lot of work around that and um but and the results are promising so look forward to that in our next evaluation report what did kids really really learn when it came to their experience with code studio uh another thing i just want to point out real quick is a programming test of transfer we did with our high school students and so they program in an environment called scratch with which many you guys know about we put them on a new environment to see whether their scratch programming skills transferred to a new environment and guess what it did with actually quite good results we're going to be backing up that study with a more rigorous study involving validated instruments this year so that was more of like a pilot study and the results are promising let's move to the next slide so pat just as you're transitioning i wanted to add that all of the student learning data in our evaluation report comes from code studio data which is gathered by us at code.org it was not part of our outlier evaluation study so just so that you're aware it didn't come from the questionnaires and interviews it came from another data set and as pat mentioned we've recently brought on board a data engineer and a learning scientist so we have tons of data and we're really excited to roll up our sleeves this year and dig into it yup hey i just want to mention something that flavia said about um how code.org is just a starting point you know flava uses scratching logo that's awesome like every teacher who's watching this video right now should understand that once again code.org is not a an endpoint it's not a full solution we're hoping that you guys do use scratch you do use um uh you know scalable game design out of the university of colorado we we hope you use app inventor we hope you use um tinker we hope you use all these thirdparty things because um they provide such a rich experience for kids so i just want to make that clear as well because i see this in the chat room i'm going to finish up with this program cost and wrap up the other things program costs i mean you guys can take a look at this later when you're working at national scale cost actually matters and so we believe that our costs are actually um quite good compared to other programs out there and it makes our ability to um scale a lot easier because our mission really is to bring computer science to every single student not necessarily code.org to every student but computer science to every student and we're just trying to play our part let's go on to the next slide all right connections to other subject areas all right so does computer science actually help learning in math and learning in science and other fields um this chart that you guys are seeing right now actually shows that there's quite a strong correlation between um taking computer science ap computer science in this case and doing better in a b calculus and bc calculus and statistics that's that's awesome that's wonderful um that's correlation not causation i just want to say that but there are studies being done right now to explore that further so basically a lot of promising results from folks like the college board and folks like bootstrap one of our partners in the cs and algebra program let's go on to the next slide here are up to date results scores out of a scale of six one to six from our workshops uh that happened summer 2015 so all this evaluation stuff we're talking about um is from um june 14 to june 15 this is june to july so this is hot off the presses the k5 has a little footnote that you don't see 14 000 teachers that's teachers total not the teachers that were pd'd in in summer 2015 that's like a cumulative total so things are going well and you'll see a a new program right here computer science principles uh it's our uh we piloted the pd and probably in the curriculum right now um and you'll see that it's being very well received by the 113 teachers who have participated in the pilot i'm done with that slide great well thanks pat at this time we'd love to open it up for q a and discussion so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and minimize the slides on my side and ask you if you have a webcam tonight if you could turn it on we'd love to see your faces and actually have a discussion here so as people are turning their webcams on they should be lining up towards this bottom of the screen if that's not happening for you you can go ahead and at the bottom of your screen there's some toggle buttons where you can make the webcams bigger or smaller we're going to be using the chat pod to post questions or if you'd like to just kind of wave your hand in your webcam i can call on you and then you can unmute yourself and speak your question as well so i'm gonna go ahead and take a look in the chat pod to see if there's any questions but as we're warming up for that i wanted to ask um pat and heather like you guys have both spent a ton of time in this evaluation data from a bunch of different points of view um and i just would love to hear from each of you um you know what what are you most proud of what was the biggest piece of good news in what you saw what was most exciting to you and then what scared you most and what you saw what were you most concerned about so take that away and then anyone else who has questions put them in the chat pod honestly the thing that scared me the most was the finding that i addressed earlier from counselors and administrators saying that a good portion of them didn't think they had the resources and i you know i've heard that from a lot of different people in a lot of different places for example um i talked with some teachers in chicago and some of you might know that in chicago computer science is going to be a graduation requirement i think in the next it's down to like three or four years now they're going to implement that so that's a pretty big deal and that's a big place you know that's a really big district um so there's a lot of moving pieces that that need to be put into place for that to happen and so as i was talking to some of the teachers there and hearing about um you know they have like one computer in the whole school and it doesn't work or something like that it's it's pretty scary and and i just think about the kids there and like how their experience is going to be so much different from a school in the same city with different resources and i don't know how to solve that and maybe i can't solve it but that was one of the scarier things that that i heard um what about what were you happiest about or was most encouraging yeah i think that again thinking about the um at the district level and at the higher administrator level um how talking to those people and and hearing how excited that they are about computer science and how important they think it is i think that's pretty exciting because you know those those people have power and they can they can help make this happen and so the more we can get those people on board the better yeah pat highs and lows yeah highs was um how how brave these teachers were in trying something new because um almost i mean the great majority of the teachers that we pd um were teaching um other subjects um not computer science and so they were trying something new and i just want to applaud the thousands of teachers trying uh this computer science thing for the first time ever with their kids because they know that it's worthwhile and even if they're not an expert they can they can at least do something to help their kids so that was the that was the um that was the high and especially the fact that these teachers who are so brave actually um had a good time at our professional development uh as a former teacher i've been through lots of bad professional development um and uh i never wanted to be a purveyor of bad professional development so i appreciate that as a high as a as a low i guess it would be our student learning outcomes um uh we're just you know this is just our first year so most people don't even worry about student learning outcomes um but i wish we had thought about it more right from the beginning we were more focused on the teacher aspect but really what it comes down to it is is the student student learning you know even if i guess even if teachers are having a bad time as long as students are having a good time and learning i guess that's really what it's about anyway of course i want teachers to have a good time too but you know you guys get what i'm saying you're talking to teachers right now that's right so those are my highs and lows wonderful okay so let's see i've got something here from grant that i'll need to read or pat heather maybe you could do that as well um and then flavia i see you have your webcam on did you want to ask a question or anything you can go ahead and unmute oh there's grant would you like to ask us go right ahead graham and then flappy you can go next if you had a question um i was just wondering because we see different types of teachers in the k5 area either implementing their coding into their classroom lessons and then we have the special area teachers um and uh they're dedicating their technology class to coding now which i think is a great 21st century update right um have you guys seen anything as far as your data or in observations uh the difference between the teacher side which one's better for the teacher and which one's better for the students because intuitively you would think special area teachers um or the students would get more of it so maybe they're doing better but is that so do do you have anything any information about that well i'll say that i think the pretty big majority of teachers that we've surveyed in the spring of this year were technology facilitators and so they taught more than one section and are we good there we go um so i would say that it's much more common from what we saw to have a technology facilitator doing this and even um like the technology facilitator might even be in charge of the whole school like not just getting all of the like they would see every kid in the school and then also they would be you know trying to get the other classroom teachers on board and i would ask in the interviews like so are you the only one doing this at your school and most of them are like yeah like there's one there's like a second grade teacher and she's sort of interested but i don't actually know if she's doing it or not so the the burden was in a lot of these cases of the teachers that i talked to the burden was on the technology facilitator to really be bringing this to everybody and so i don't i don't know if there's a better way i mean it's all going to be up to the school and the teachers and how they want to divide up their time um but i do know that some of the teachers that i talked to a lot so in chicago and charles county those were some of the places that i did a lot of the interviews um they already have other things the technology facilitators have other things they're supposed to be doing too they have history they have keyboarding which you know you might think that's not something that needs to be you know there might not you spend a lot of time on that but if you're talking about um a kindergartner who's maybe used to the touch screen i hear that a lot like they just want to swipe everything and they don't know how to use the keyboard they don't know how to use the mouse yet so you have to spend a lot of time getting into that and so they're all of these demands i guess and i guess i'm saying i don't know what about what about for the classroom teachers um my worry so so i've seen a lot of the technology special area teachers but then when i see people wanting to do the classroom teachers teach the coding have you seen if they actually teach it like will they actually take the time out to do it on a regular basis and how much time do you have you found that they do take to teach coding that's a really good question i think that anything that i say is just going to be based on the small number like a couple hundred teachers that were classroom teachers that took the survey so that's one thing to keep in mind and also keep in mind that anybody who filled out our survey is already super motivated because they didn't have to do it like nobody's telling i'm the only one telling them to do it you know they're really sweet nice teachers that did that for us but um i think that the people that are really committed are making it happen and i that's across the board so that's not just for elementary i think that's true we've seen that with high school even before code.org existed we interviewed and talked with teachers at the high school level who are like i want computer science in my school i'm going to go and bother the principal every day until i make it happen um and i think the opportunity is those so hitting the teachers that want to do it that's where you start but then the next opportunity is the folks who are kind of on the edge and they just need a little bit of confidence and they need a little bit of they need to believe that the time is well spent um and i think that's really our opportunity now is to go after that group of teachers and support them great and now that we have a data engineer at code.org and a learning scientist um we'll be able to look at some more less anecdotal data about implementation and actually look at how these student accounts are being used so hopefully by this time next year we'll be having a different conversation about this but it's a huge point grant yeah huge pat do you want to add anything that was good okay okay so we also about five minutes left grant so go ahead no you're fine i don't want to monopolize if anyone else has a question we are happy to have your questions i'm just looking to see if there are any others go right ahead okay so when you partner with the district you recommend then the special area class being the area to do the coding or is there a recommendation or do you just say whatever works best for your district and then hope that it gets done we we have implementation scenarios that are available that we share with um with the district that partner with us and uh they and from there they just pick what works best for them so um you know in some districts they have a dedicated computer lab feature in every single elementary school and thus they probably picked that some of them um they have um the the media specialists be played a double role as a computer lab teacher right and so they in that case they implemented through the the media lab time and so it really just depends but yeah we we have implementation scenarios that we suggest and uh they just pick and choose from there um okay last question if nobody else is asking oh sorry go ahead last one for for those teachers that are doing the whole school and right now there are only well there's four now right uh of course you guys have four courses for the k5 um if um but for k5 there's six classes or you know uh grade levels so for those ones that are teaching all of it what happens now um you know in the next few years when the first graders who are in course one and then they move on to course two and then three and then four and then you know are there plans to keep expanding and i know there are a lot of other resources but you guys are just doing such a great job with the curriculum for teachers that don't know computer science are there plans to keep expanding to help include um lots of schools that can't hire someone who's actually trained in computer science yeah i'll answer that question because i'm the one who's been dealing with that the most um so yeah how do you set up a pathway for longevity and um that's basically what you're asking so this is what we're doing this is a this is top secret all right grant um okay but over the next few years over the next two years we plan to allow some level of customization for all of our course content um in the cs fundamentals program so what that means is that grant who teaches at a k through five school and wants to implement it in every single grade not just four grades or three or whatever that's up his courses himself using our puzzles as chunks and places them in some kind of you know course sequence that works for his goal so rather than coming up with maybe an implementation that works for 20 of the schools out there and then just hoping that other people figured out we we're just kind of opening up the we're giving teachers and districts the keys and letting them kind of configure their own um courses out of this material that's our goal awesome awesome very cool so this is great we love having this dialogue and um thank you so much for your questions grant and everyone else in the chat pod i do want to just reserve the last couple of minutes to summarize um and just to let you guys know that we're always open to having this dialogue in these conversations um at the end of uh the presentation i'll give you some ways that you can stay in contact with us and we can continue this chat and that goes for us two at outlier we're always happy i will take any question you have email me anytime you want and you know i'm happy to talk about whatever because i love doing this yeah i think for all of us this is you know our life's work and none of us have the answers so we're more than willing to engage in dialogue um so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to hand it back over to pat to summarize this evening and we're very lucky to have our special summarizer guest here mcyp um let me see people are wondering what why are they talking about what it is okay pat take it away oh so no slide right i can just take it away here it is here is the debut of mcyp which is this is i just want to preface this with this is a kind of silly but this is uh something i do at code.org i sometimes wrap so i'm i prepared a wrap thanking our cs community and our partners who've made code.org's work um even possible in its first year so this is to the tune of king of rock i'm not going to play the beat because it doesn't work very well in this situation but you can always go to youtube and look at run dmc's king of rock if you don't know it i'm a fan of 80s hip hop so that's why i picked king of rock so here we go all right ready i work at code.org situation is dire cs is awesome participation should be higher thanks to you all cs is on fire we can't stop working even when we tire now we rock k12 and come correct love computer science we need to connect thanks to thinkorsmith k5 has been set and to all others we've learned from we give you respect ecs and csp are getting bigger this is what we figure they have academic rigor and both are two pillars of nsf's work on them our hopes we can hang they're guaranteed they're guaranteed to be more popular than ap lang cs in math where math is the goal the bootstrap crew algebra and cs in their soul in middle schools they play a big role cs and math knowledge to teachers they dole um as we crash school walls sure we have our flaws don't just rely on our d on our ideas we rely on y'alls like project guts cnc cs in science they rock simulation is cool you'll hear the kids talk and talk for all our partners and friends and for new folks will meet all of us together no one can defeat beat beat it's a it's an echo so there you guys go it's it's on video um that's just something i like to do every now and then that's that's that's to our cs community and all of our partners i hope you hope you guys appreciate that love it pat we're gonna have to get you to do it again though over the music at some point because i think um it's not the same without the the beatbox in the background did you have any other parting words for us before i close out thank you for doing that pat you're a rock star yeah yeah i'm just i know guys i'm just silly i i just had to do it sorry so never apologize for rocking the mic so so for all you guys out there watching this live and watching it um on youtube right now or whatever a recording we just want you to know that um this is really a community affair we can't do this we really can't do this without you guys like our partners out there um our k5 affiliate trainer trainers our affiliates you know all of our facilitators out there who run the pd for us i mean um you guys are the key to code.org success i want to thank you guys and thank all you brave teachers out there for trying on computer science thanks so much pat so just as a reminder we're going to be hosting these webinars regularly throughout the fall our next one coming up on november 18th is focused on the hour of code and how teachers can implement our code in your classroom we have some really exciting best practices that we've captured from the hundreds of thousands of educators who have done our code in the past that we're excited to share with you um and that one we will be hosting through google hangouts on air so um you can find the link to that session into all of our upcoming sessions at code.org educate events and then also as i mentioned we are really open to having this dialogue and continue the conversation if you haven't already you should follow us on twitter at teach code that's where we're having our conversation about computer science education from a teacher's perspective we also have a teacher blog teacherblog.cod.org easy to remember um and a teacher forum which is forum.code.org there's also a facebook group too so if you go to facebook and search for cs education we're having kind of a discussion of more broadly about cs education beyond just code.org there so that's a great place also to get involved in the conversation um and again on behalf of code.org and heather and everyone here we want to say thank you for joining us thanks for making this a fun session tonight and we look forward to continuing the conversation bye
