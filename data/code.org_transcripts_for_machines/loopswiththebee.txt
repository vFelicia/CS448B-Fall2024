A loop is a repetition of activity. Going into a hive to inspect, I look at a frame, and then I put it back. I repeat that same activity multiple times. It's looping around, doing the same activity multiple times. This is the repeat block. Whatever you put inside the repeat block will repeat those actions the number of times that you tell it to. For example, in this level, rather than drag out move forward and get nectar three times, we're going to just drag them out once each and repeat the action three times. That made it easy!
