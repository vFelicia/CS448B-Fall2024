hi everyone and thanks for joining us today my name is leoland bowen and i'm an outreach manager on the education programs team here at code.org i've had the pleasure of speaking with a lot of amazing professionals during the cs journeys class chats this semester but today is a personal favorite today i'm speaking with genevieve johnson senior instructional designer for roblox an online game platform and game creation system that allows users to program games and play a game created by other users it is also one of my son's favorite game platforms i'm so excited to speak with her today about her experiences assisting in the creation of the roblox world hi genevieve hi leon so the first question i have is a very serious question that came from my 11 year old son matheo who wants to know if you get paid in robux i do not so yeah sometimes if i want to make robux then i gotta go make my game and earn them just just like mateo i'm gonna be very disappointed to hear but thank you for sharing that so can you take a couple minutes to introduce yourself and your role at roblox so my name is genevieve johnson i am a senior instructional designer for roblox and what that means is i teach people how to teach people how to make games and experiences and all the different kinds of events that you see on roblox so that means i get to work with teachers like all like all across the world and i work with them to bring roblox into the classroom so students can do really really cool things perfect yeah and how does computer science um play in your career so i use computer science every single day so as i'm creating these new worlds and actually if you give me a second i can actually show you something um so i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen out so this is roblox studio and within roblox studio this is where all of the different worlds that you see and roblox are made like everything in roblox made right here roblox studio and within it if i want to take something that's maybe just a giant world like you know nothing's really particular happening like i've got this this island but i've got some pirate ships over there if i want to make those pirate ships shoot cannonballs or something like that then i could have to use code so i get to teach people how to both create the world and then also how to use code to make those worlds come really to life thank you that that's so cool like that's so fun to see the background about how that works thanks for sharing and before we go into the next question i just want to remind everyone who is watching that we will have time for questions throughout so if you have any questions please feel free to put them in the chat and we'll try to get to them all so can you tell us a little bit more about um a recent project you've worked on that you've really enjoyed okay so probably the thing that i am most proud of right now is that i just finished my second book and it's called coding of roblox lua in 24 hours so within that book i actually get to teach people from the very beginning how the code if you want to see a picture of the cover this is a picture of the cover right here coding with roblox lua in 24 hours you can get it pretty much anywhere but i really take people from the start with what's a variable what's a string and then i take them all the way up to doing like really cool things so um somewhere back here i've got i've got a lot of files up i do a lot of work on a daily basis um so actually this is what i was looking for it said that like my favorite project in all of this is like actually not only like me getting to be creative but allowing the people who visit my world being creative so you can actually use code to allow your your visitors in your world to also place objects so like if they've got a house they can decorate it if they've got a garden they can put in flowers so stuff like that and it's all within that book everything from the very very beginning assuming that you've never touched code in your life all the way up to some very sophisticated topics and for the students who may not have heard of lua can you explain a little bit more about that what that is lua is a lot like python if you've ever used python so it is a textbased language um but there's a lot less to type than there is and maybe perhaps a lot of other different programming languages so if you've ever done java you're going to find there's a lot less typing but also if you've done something on the other side like scratch where maybe you've done some visual drag and drop coding you're going to find those concepts that you learned are still going to help you as you're learning a new programming language of lua perfect thank you and so can you tell us what kind of things do you like to do outside of work so i really believe in having a lot of hobbies and things like that uh i believe because i like making games i like making worlds and experiences um i like making stories so i i play a lot of video games for one so i think on my on my desk i've got just about every type of controller there is um and then i also do a lot of art so i've always been really big into art um and then i lift i go to the gym and i spend time with my little tortoise who i love so so dearly yay is it yeah so this is this is this is tenochtitlan we just call her nochi she is a threeyearold burmese star so she's absolutely in love with my life um so i spent a lot of time just finding flowers for her to eat and then feeding them to her and growing like i've thrown a whole garden for her basically so this is noche she's so cute thanks for sharing it yeah saying earlier she's not really a morning tortoise so i had to give her a nice warm bath you know it's like the equivalent of tortoise copy to like wake her up and be like all right what are we doing out this morning we're not doing things this early normally what's going on i love that yes i can relate to not being a morning person as i'm sure some of the students watching can as well um so my next question is when you were younger what did you want to be when you grew up so the first thing i wanted to be was a veterinarian um as you know i love animals like no tv and one example of how much i love animals and you know i really liked raising birds and and rabbits and all those kinds of things but then i kind of decided that that didn't work for me um so that's what i wanted when i was younger because i'm just so fascinated with science and like seeing like how animals and genetics could be bred for different things yeah so how did you end up in coding then because being a veterinarian and being a working in game design seems totally different how's that work yeah so it's kind of to me it's really sort of fascinating so i decided i didn't want to be a veterinarian um but i loved drawing animals i was always really fascinated by this a lot of the science behind like the way anatomy works uh so i kind of like started leaning more into like here i'll show you so this is this is a dragon that i i drew in in high school like i literally drew it in high school but as a kind of a lifelong passion it's always like how do dragons work they don't exist right like how do their wings work how do their legs work how does their tail like what's the anatomy that makes that work so kind of like through those questions um that's sort of like how it relates to like animals like so like having to study like bat wings or having to study like a lizard's tail or even like a horse's head to figure out how do i make these completely imaginary animals that don't exist and then uh one day this guy came into my classroom he was an old student of my art teacher he was working for uh the film industry making monsters so he like came in with like these giant clay busts you know like the head torsos and like of these like monsters like these like sort of predator looking monsters like you know that he'd been sculpting and he explained that this is what he did for a living and i was like that's what i want to do for a living and then from art to the so like i went i started to explore doing computer graphics because i was really into tech and animation turned out i didn't really care for modeling i computer modeling is like you make the the actual figure that you know people can then manipulate to animate in the world um because it just like wasn't alive enough for me so then i started exploring animation which i loved and that came back to that scientific observation how did things work and that led me eventually to game development um not only could i just like make this animal come to life i could make this whole entire world come to life i can make things that never existed and the more that i wanted to do the more i had to learn how to code the more i had to learn how to like get in there if i wanted that explosion if i wanted that dragon to fly i had to learn how to code to make that happen and so before i started working at code.org and i imagine this might be true for a lot of the students who are watching right now when i hear about someone who's a coder i think i have to be really really smart and i'd be really really good at math yeah yeah no no no no i am so bad at math uh i'm literally dyslexic so like i can understand how math works but then like the numbers just don't stay in place for me uh same thing you know like with reading like people but with code i really came at it because i'm more of an artistic person and i really love thinking about how things work uh so that's not true at all i would say you know even if you can't spell if you're not like a good writer there's autocorrect for code there's you know all these different engines that will help you like handle the code and how the logic works so i will say most of the engineers i know are actually very fun and creative zany people so that that sort of stereotype is yeah out there okay that's good to know yeah yeah yeah anyone can code i always tell people like it doesn't matter what you like you can read code like if you like music or football or you know any other sports or animals there's something that code can do to to um help your your interest out or to spread the word about it so i'm interested because you said a little bit ago that you love playing games so when i play roblox i love tycoon games i love being able to build i love seeing my money accumulate i love that that world of being able to build something within this game what type of games do you enjoy playing i really like actually i do like tycoons i find them really like soothing you just sort of like build something and you click a button and then you build something else um but i tend to like weird zany games and that's what i really love about roblox is like you'll have all of a sudden someone will make it like a world that's not even a game as we know it it might be this beautiful recreation of how ancient greek temple look like and you know so i'll go wander through it and just sort of like experience like the zen of that temple or like uh sometimes they'll be these story games where if you make a wrong choice the narrator will be kind of snarky and they'll make funny jokes uh and there's one there's one game that i i really really love called this is not a simulator game in a white box and if you if you like it'll give you these choices where you can be like oh you want to skip this or and then if you're if you snark back to the narrator it'll just kick you out of the game so i love really weird games i also love peaceful games and then like at home i play i play everything and i think that's kind of a good thing to do as a developer like play everything don't feel precious about like oh i'm into shooters and i'm into this and i like i can like fashion games and shooters yeah i think that's what makes the specific game platform so great is there's a variety of of games that uh people can play depending on what they like or maybe even what they like that day so thank you for sharing that yeah sometimes i'm like i just want to stroll through some woods and just sort of like look at pretty things exactly um and so along your way um to your career that you are now what kind of obstacles have you faced and um if any how have you gone about approaching them so probably i would say probably the biggest obstacle for me was when i was younger i didn't really know how i was going to go to college um so i was scared to even really try to go to college because i didn't know how my family was going to be able to afford that my older brother like he would have these sort of periods but even with a scholarship he would have to come back home for a while and then and then try again um so instead of like you know just giving up what i did is i you know as i was working in my retail jobs i just went to community college and i just took what i could in my art teachers there were really great as well as like my mom was really great you know everyone was like hey it doesn't really matter how long it takes you if there's this thing you want to do you got to keep working at it and doesn't you know don't judge yourself by what other people are doing so i went to community college for four years and then eventually i was able to get enough you know money together and might get my credit enough you know high enough up to to get a loan on my own to go to college and finish out the other two years but that also took me four years so it took me eight years to get to college um so that was probably i would say like the biggest thing obstacle that i've had in terms of my career is just like not getting impatient with the amount of time it was taking me to get to where i thought i should be yeah i i can imagine that be a struggle because we especially with college we hear that you're supposed to finish in four years so if it takes a little longer i can imagine that it could be a little um worrisome or frustrating so it's good to hear that you say that you kept working at it and you're here now yeah yeah that's it right yeah i mean you'll get there eventually uh you know life is both short and long so just keep working at it like you know and you'll you'll regret trying far less and you'll regret like not even trying yeah were there any people whether it's school or family or anything like that who've helped you along the way and how so you know there's so many people that helped me along the way like so a lot of teachers who knew that i was taking one or two classes while i would say working two jobs sometimes three jobs during like the holiday season um you know that were able to talk to me and and i say like talk if you are in tough situations talk to your teachers let them know what's up let your school officials know what's up at one point i was falling asleep on a couch and one of my school advisors was like just tell me and i'll come and wake up wake you up make sure you don't miss class but also my mom so my mom is mexicanamerican i'm mixed so my mom no matter what i was doing it didn't matter if i was working at a bookstore or like just going to a comic book store my mom was like we need more mexicanamerican women in the bookstore like you know we mean more mexicanamerican women representing us in tech and i was like yeah mom you're right you know and and even though i myself am you know very white passing i'm mixed you know my last name is johnson um that also like sticks with me like how can i be a representation of that how can i help people who um you know and bring them into the space that maybe like i was more comfortable in you know someone who you know doesn't feel more comfortable in that space how can i make them feel more comfortable because i'm very used to being the only woman in the room or being like you know the only person of mixed ethnicity or whatever it may be i'm very like comfortable with that because i've been you know i did martial arts as a kid i go to the gym like you know in the video game world ever all that's gotten better but trying to be very comfortable like no matter what you want to do like just go and do it don't look for other people just go and do it yeah i think your mom and i sound a lot of like my son is biracial as well black caribbean and colombian and so he definitely hears a lot of that from me as well of the importance of more than what he probably wants to hear about the importance of representation importance of feeling comfortable with sometimes being the only person of um whether it's gender race or ethnicity or all the other things that make us unique and fun so um i appreciate your mom yeah i didn't appreciate it as a kid i have to say like now that i'm older i really i really appreciate it i really understand what she was talking about and i really appreciate she like just never let me take like i don't know what if i'm the only girl as like an excuse she's like well too bad exactly exactly yeah those things that make us different make us really unique and give us a cool insight so um tell your mom thanks so much we do have a couple more questions but i just want to remind the audience that if you have any questions at all feel free to put it in the chat box we would love to hear um any questions that you might have for genevieve before in these last few minutes we have um so going back up you did show us that really amazing picture of the drawing that you drew my dragon would look nothing like that are there any other strengths that you have that you feel contributed to your success um i said the the ability to just be the only person in the room and never really worrying about that uh which i think any other beliefs i have so i really like to think about um the other person that i'm you know developing products for it so to be able to look outside of yourself and be like will this work for someone else will this experience like if the person comes in do they know where to go um if i'm making uh i do a lot of tutorials i do a lot of writing so trying to think about like how someone else is going to perceive my words so i think like you know take a lot of criticism and like but seeing it as that makes me stronger like looking actively seeking feedback so always taking my like whatever i'm doing getting feedback from it and taking that as a way to be better and not like oh no they didn't like it yeah that's a that's a crucial skill yeah you can get in that like so if you're if you're um if you're an artist or you're looking to start you know on roblox or something start making experience just start working and start sharing it with your friends share with your family get feedback and if they're like oh this is too hard don't tell them that they don't understand take a step back and figure out okay how can i make this more a more enjoyable experience perfect so we do have a couple of teacher questions that are about your book so can you give us a little bit more information about it in terms of when it will it be released where could folks find it if they're interested in purchasing it so you can actually get um there's two of them and then if i i think i closed out my picture so one is roblox development in 24 hours that one is currently available and the cover looks very very similar so let me yeah i did close it out uh but and then there's co that one is already out so that'll teach you things about like how do you make terrain work it does have a lot of coding within it because honestly once to really make things come alive you just need code but that the code in there is much more like here's the code that you add in but with coding in 24 hours during roblox lua that one which is coming out next month um and if people are really interested you can actually reach out to me at education roblox.com so that's our if you guys want to know you know anything more about like the creative commons materials that we have available or our education website yeah education roblox.com um education.roblox.com is the website but um the coding book will be out next month how exciting i'm so excited i'm so excited for this one like i love teaching code and like i feel like this is just the culmination of everything i've done so far so yeah yeah and especially in this topic let me tell you when i take my son to the library and i see the kids playing on the computer all of them are playing roblox like it's so popular so it's really exciting um another audience question is art do you all um you just gave your email if folks have questions do you all offer inperson coding classes that people can attend so we don't so we don't but like what we like to do is um we offer up this creative commons materials we offer good resources like the books that were created and then we have like hundreds literally hundreds of education you know organizations that we work with everything from curriculum um distributors and publishers to you know like mom and pops you know so you can take our creative common materials you can use them in your classroom as is or you can uh work with one of our many many like fantastic educators and they also you know that could provide uh i'll say resources and materials as well as well as instruction yeah but we ourselves don't actually offer classes directly okay we have a little onboarding for teachers though so if you come to our website like we've got courses for you that you can kind of be like oh this help roblox works this is how you make an account this is how you play a game yeah i imagine that'll be very useful to the parents and teachers watching yeah you know we try to be very considerate like you know this is how you you use the keyboard to move around so the next audience question actually ties in perfectly with the next question that i had for you which is about um being able to work at a company like roblox so if a student is watching this and they're like yes this is what i want to do i would love to be in game design and i would love to work for roblox what what does that look like what does what steps can they one start working on now and then part two of that question is what does the interview process look like for someone who who wants to do what you do so i would say if you want to work um you know making virtual experiences or roblox specifically uh start working on it now i would say so many of the employees at roblox started from the community we love hiring community members because they understand what our platform's about they have fantastic skills and they're motivated so um i would say whatever it is if you're an artist you know go and draw like everything around you draw animals draw the trees at the park draw up the buildings um and then take that in to roblox and recreate your local park or your school and recreate your drawings if you're interested in animation then you can try that out if you're interested in coding we have great resources like on our site education.roblox.com uh that free as well as like i said you can reach out to our coach but just like start my point is start try a little bit of everything um and you'll start developing a portfolio and then reach out to community members so you can get onto the forums we have developer forums for but we also like um an educator section of the developer forums you can reach out to like your peer groups if you're a student so you can you know your friends you're trying to create an experience together with your friends uh you know there's there's apps you know like discord or other you know roblox groups or that are interested in developing their own experiences so like if you love history i guarantee like it doesn't matter like what era of history it could be a very specific these two years of history you can find groups in roblox that also love history and want to make experiences that recreate that era or you know allow you to experience what it was like to live in that time or go to the moon no matter what it was or be as you know a zookeeper and so as you just keep working with people make friends show your work off get on twitter get on you know social media and be willing to both give positive feedback and i mean like critical feedback be like oh i think you could do this a little bit better but also take it ask people for feedback and that's how you develop these relationships that down the line are very valuable and then as you get older in college and in high school go to conferences so there's siggraph which is a conference that is for computer graphics and animation particular volunteering is a great way to go i would say more cheaply than you could otherwise and you also get like instant access to like everyone there who also really loves what you love uh pax is another good one and that's a giant gaming convention that happens on all coasts you can uh volunteer as well so yeah the moral story comes just start doing it and start looking for other people who want to do it with you can you um say again those two conferences that you just mentioned can you spell out just in case people need to write them down siggraph is one that's a little not as well known it's siggraph special interest group in computer graphics that's what it stands for so it's part of amc association machine computing and then pax is pax like xylophone packs um i don't know penny arcade expo that's what it stands for i was like what does that stand for so you know that's just like a big gaming conference you know people will dress up uh but even there is a pack stuff like you know like a developer section of that but i would say even just becoming part of these communities where you can find likeminded people um other like another huge one in the industry is gdc the game developers conference that's the largest game developers conference it's held in san francisco every year uh so if you can go go on like they'll have student days i highly recommend being a student volunteer whenever you can be um and just like i said yeah meet other people get involved with like your clubs at heist you know at the high school level you know make your own club i love that suggestion at volunteering at conferences i think that's a good but when you work in a field that's a good way to networking and being able to go to conferences either for free or for less amount we're able to volunteer so yeah a little nugget to take those those people who are students when i was a student are now like some of my strongest you know i would say ties in the industry like always be nice to everyone you never know who they're going to be in a few years and a lot of times you know like you're like oh yeah wait i know so and so i met them few years ago to go at a conference um and like those those ties are you know really important yeah so you've talked you showed us the cool work that you're doing and i know you've probably seen a lot of games and experience in a roblox is there any game that you've seen that someone create that either was um surprised you or you thought that was really cool and innovative oh my gosh i mean all the time and i'm like i'm like overwhelmed because i'm just like where do i even even start um let's see the on roblox all right hold on i feel like i need a visual but it would take me too long to bring up so i think what's really cool about roblox experiences is that they can be these hangout spaces that aren't necessarily rooted in the real world so if you we just did like these concerts like one of the ones that we did we did like a 21 pilots concert um but what i love music and i love going to concerts but what i kind of live like there was like this music going on i can dress up my character i had a scooter but also like the way that we were experiencing the music was not a way we could do in real life so it was like we would get transported around um we would like playing with the space that we were in so we would be you would be in one space and then you would fall through the floor and then you'd be in this like disco room and then you would be dancing and you'd step on a square and then like suddenly you're like uh in a virtual forest and then like all of a sudden like the the singers and the drummers you know like they'll be giant like your tiny little people dancing at their feet so i think like being able to take something like for me it's just really familiar going to a concert and then like twisting it so not just are we trying to do like recreate real life we're trying we're taking advantage of what virtual reality you know like not even like a headset but like what that virtual space can do to like help you connect to the music a lot more than like maybe you even could if you're up in the nosebleeds of some giant concert like you know 21 pilots i i would probably be like that far away and you'd be like where are they at like yeah oh man i wish we had more time but somehow we got through 30 minutes that quickly so i wanted to say thank you for joining us today yeah it was really great to hear about your experiences um working at roblox and working in game design so thank you for your time today teachers please fill out the survey that you will receive via email tomorrow and be sure to check out the other class chats and virtual field trips at code.org cs journeys they're happening all semester long thanks genevieve and thanks everyone
