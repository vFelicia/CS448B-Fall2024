everyone and thank you for joining us for a special our code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week joining us today is delwyn publisher for BuzzFeed the popular news and entertainment outlet known for pioneering a datadriven approach to web content students join me in welcoming Dow to you our video chat today joining us we'll go ahead and jump into questions if that's okay with you you are I'm very looking forward to it great so our first question is going to come from Alma Intermediate School in Alma Arkansas what is your favorite BuzzFeed post that went viral hi everyone that's a great question there's so many of my favorite posts but I think that my most favorite post is the one about the dress now let me see a show of hands who how many of you thought the dress was white and gold how many of you thought it was blue and black all right and how many of you have no idea what I'm talking about it was a it was a a great post you asked your friends who saw it where there was a picture of a dress and people couldn't decide what colors it was which seems like a very straightforward thing but it was my favorite post because it really just got a lot of people talking to each other and having a debate about about things that we know and things that we don't know and people were just showing each other pictures of the dress on their phone it was it was a it was quite a phenomenon earlier this year but in February of 2015 that was that was my favorite post you guys can check it out if you have for those of you who haven't seen it thanks Dale actually I remember when that post came out and we had a huge office debate about what the color actually was great our next school is Prairie elementary school from Worthington Minnesota that's a um that's another great question there's so many things that surprised me about what people find really shareable and what people wouldn't want to talk about BuzzFeed a lot of people just know us for our funny lists and our videos which are all amazing but what people don't know is that actually a lot of our very serious investigations and and essays are shared a lot and go pretty viral we have reporting about Ebola about Isis about investigations into companies that do bad things you know that take advantage of people about women who were treated really unfairly about laws that that send kids teenagers to jail for for skipping school all these stories got you know hundreds of thousands millions or in some cases over a million views which is a lot of people and so those kinds of stories also get you know go viral or get shared a lot and that's a that's an important part of being an immediate company too so I encourage you to look at so look at some of those two if those if you if you come across them great thank you our next question is going to come from Trinity school of Texas and Longview Texas what is an example of a small feature change you made to a story or post that ended up making a huge difference so that's that's a great question because what people see at the end when things go really viral as I see the end product they don't see all of the things that didn't work that at the beginning that really led to us learning something that led to big success later and I think that that has a lot of it has a lot of parallels to what we do every day and what you guys do at school which is learning sometimes when you first learn something it doesn't work right but then if you keep keep at it then then it can then you learn more and you get really good at it so the example we'll talk about is quizzes so how many people here are taking a BuzzFeed quiz is anyone we get a BuzzFeed quiz there's some yeah okay a few hands and so we've been doing quizzes for a long time and one of the changes that we tried a couple of years ago was to put the answers of the quiz in a grid format instead of in a list format and that was just something that an entrepreneurial editor tried doing and it ended up getting a lot more engagement people took the quiz thought it was more fun to take even though the format of the content of the quiz was the same and so we just experimented more and more with how we show quiz answers and that ended up I ended up making quizzes a lot more fun to take and then ended up with us having a huge run of really popular quizzes that tens of millions of people millions people took so it's something that you see now but it wasn't always done that way and it sort of talks about how the more you try things and the more you work at at making things better than the more success you'll have great Thank You Dow our next question is going to come from cash on high school and cash on Oklahoma what advice do you have for someone when trying to launch a new website and making a popular hmm let's see I guess what I would say is that you should really think about what other people are looking for like why some why other people would want to use your service or your website and and and talk to a lot of those kinds of people and say oh do you think this would be really useful and do you think this would be interesting and why and maybe really sort of candid about about what you want to do with the kinds of people that you that you're interested in and then and then the other thing I guess is to is to realize that it's really hard to get it right the first time and to always be thinking about how you how you can improve and what you can learn from the people who are using your service or not using your you not using your service I think that I think that the probably the the the services and the things that are most successful today are made by people who who made things in the past that didn't work well but then who were able to learn from that and I think that's something that you know you learn as a kid in school when growing up but even as adults all right you know what we're doing here at BuzzFeed certainly is we're always trying to learn more about what people are doing and why and and how we can how we can serve them better with with better content or a better experience great and we'll have one more question from one one last school today Rosa Parks Mill Brook Elementary in Lancaster Texas it's beltline about line evolution if you can create an application to make your life because your world would it be alive if I get created there's an application there life easier I think that maybe it would be teleportation it'd be great if I could just teleport right into your classroom and talk to you and then teleport into the nice classroom and side to them I think that would be awesome Judy that would be cool maybe there maybe they'll be working on that soon fully that's actually what I always say as well thank you for joining us and do you have um kind of any closing thoughts and words that you would love to share with the students who talk to you today I know they're all big fans of BuzzFeed and the work you guys do I would just say keep it up I think that coding is such a fun thing to do and to have fun with it I think that's the most important thing because if you don't if you don't have fun with it then you're not going to want to do more of it and and that it's you know don't don't don't let others like tell you that it's that you're not good at it or that it's not fun it's just something that I think is it could be a thing that a lot of people can do and and and have a good time that's what I that's what I love about coding great thank you how about we have everybody unmute their mics and give dal big thank you for joining us today
