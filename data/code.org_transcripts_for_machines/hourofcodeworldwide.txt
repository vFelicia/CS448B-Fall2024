Obama "This week, I'm proud to join the students, teachers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations taking new steps to support computer science in America's schools." You guys are already getting a head start on taking over the world. I got it! They've been so excited about it. Oh my gosh, it's working. I did it! They don't even have to be a computer science engineer. Maybe they want to do something else, but in our world this is gonna be the basis for everything that we do. Obama "Move. Semicolon." Look what I did! It's so beautiful! When you're building a program, you have to think outside of the box. If you can change technology, you can change the world.
