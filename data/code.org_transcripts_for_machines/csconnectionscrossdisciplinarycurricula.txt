code.org created computer science connections as a way to integrate CS Concepts into other subject areas like math science social studies and English language arts if I knew this would help reinforce Concepts I was already teaching in the classroom just in a much more novel and engaging way this curriculum is for any teacher no matter what their background is no matter how much computer science they've done in the past no matter what they teach when you utilize code.orgs curriculum you have everything there for you it has the questions that you need to ask your students that has the lessons that you need to teach and it gives you guidance on how to do it I like about my project is being able to bring my poem to life when we have computer science situated within the context of another subject area we suddenly see the purpose of using computer science and so it's not just learning computer science for computer science sake it is learning it within a problem statement or within a project that they create or an app that they develop it is practical uses of computer science thank you my name is Brody gullick and I'm a software engineer here at Pinterest my name is Ali Chase and I am an oceanographer at the University of Washington my name is Kim now and I'm a part of the Google Maps team we wanted to show students that computer science is more than just coding so we featured artists writers and scientists in our videos so students can see that computer science is done in all sorts of Industries I think it's been a wonderful addition to my teaching repertoire we want teachers to feel inspired by this curriculum so much so that they take it and modify it so that it is relevant to what they're teaching that year in their classrooms I incorporate into my language arts lessons I incorporate into my math lessons or my science this is very easy to do found that it was so engaging for my students more than anything one of my biggest hopes with computer science connections is that it reaches a student who might have never seen themselves as somebody who would take a computer science class I'm really proud of what I created foreign
