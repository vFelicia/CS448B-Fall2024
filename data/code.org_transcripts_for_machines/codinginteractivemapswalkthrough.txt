welcome to computer science connections coding interactive maps this module makes connections between social studies and computer science specifically it can introduce reinforce or extend student learning related to geography if you're teaching about cardinal directions State history or just want to get your students coding you've come to the right place in the this module students will learn the basics of sprite lab a blockbased coding platform the main computer science Concepts in this module are Sprites and events a Sprite is something you interact with like a character or an object in a scene each Sprite can have different properties like its costume size and location in coding there are cause and effect relationships we trigger with events an event is an act action that tells a specific chunk of code to run events allow us to change our programs in real time for example by assigning a spin right Behavior with a mouse click event we can command this hamburger to spin right when it's clicked there are four lessons in this module in lesson one students learn the basics of coding by adding a tour guide Sprite and landmark Sprites they'll learn how to set a sprite's location change its size assign it a behavior and use events to make their programs interactive notice the compass at the top of the play Space it's a special feature in this module whenever the user presses an arrow key the corresponding direction is highlighted the second lesson is an unplugged lesson each student will create a project plan to get ready to code their interactive map in lesson three students will code their interactive map according to the plan they made in the previous lesson they'll use the coding skills they learned in lesson one the final lesson is also unplugged students will have time to reflect on their process and present their project to their peers often students try to snap a green event block under the win run block but this won't work the event block stands on its own and any code added to it will run when the event is triggered encourage students to frequently test their code they will need to press run then use the play Space to trigger the events a student might encounter a bug if their Sprite costume selections are inconsistent have students double check that they have selected the correct costume to call the intended Sprite in this example the coder wants the Sprite with the girl costume to say this when she touches the star Sprite however the coder mistakenly assigned the chicken Sprite to say these words because there is no chicken Sprite nothing will happen to debug change the costume from the chicken to the girl in the event block the location pins can be challenging to navigate for some students model have to click on the pin in the coding block then go to the play space and click where you want your Sprite to be located in every lesson plan discussion questions are coupled with discussion goals check for understanding and promote student Reflection by incorporating these discussion questions into your teaching this module is aligned with the college career and Civic life framework and the computer science Teachers Association standards in order to align to the concepts you already teach to help you think of ways to integrate ask yourself how might this module support the content I'm already teaching and should I use this module to introduce re force or extend student learning on this topic don't forget about the hide and show feature for each lesson it's best practice to only show the lesson students are currently working on if you do not hide the following lessons students will be moved to the next lesson automatically students can personalize their maps in two ways they can draw a new costume or background using the pisol editor or they can use it animation upload feature this allows students to upload a picture or image that is saved to their computers before teaching the module complete each coding level on your own you can write your own code as an example for students make sure to review the lesson plans and additional resources code.org provides resources like slides student handouts and helpful hints to help you and your students get started
