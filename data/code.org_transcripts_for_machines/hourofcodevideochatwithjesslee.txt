hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for a stressful hour of code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week with us today is justly the CEO and cofounder of the community powered social commerce website Polly born Jess is a computer science graduate from Stanford before cofounding Polyvore jess was a product manager at Google where she worked on Google Maps and launched features like my maps and draggable driving directions please join me in welcoming gesture eight well we'll get started with questions our first question comes from dr. and weighing middle school and Lowell Massachusetts how did you get involved in poly born sure um I was the product manager at Google I was super happy and excited to be working on and then one day someone showed me Polyvore it was a friend of mine we shared an off and showed it to me and I just started using the product every night because I loved it so much so poly bar lets you mix and match clothing into the outfit through these collages that we call sets and millions of people come to browse and shop those looks and I started playing with it and I just loved it because it was kind of this combination of art and technology and I was just really excited user and so I wrote a note to the cofounders I didn't know them at the time but I just wrote a note with some product suggestions some complaints and feedback and they wrote back and said hey why don't why don't you come here instead of complaining why don't you come and fix it yourself why don't you join us at Polyvore and that's how I got involved and met them in real life really liked them and decided hey I think I want to do this so I ended up at Polyvore did a little bit of everything we're very small at the time about a company of five people so I did everything from writing code to washing dishes to selling advertising got to learn a lot of new cool things and we've grown and grown since then and we're about 120 people at the company now and I became CEO about three years ago but it's been a pretty exciting and kind of unusual journey but that's how I got involved so I would say it kind of taught me to be proactive about you know when you have feedback on something or you're interested in something just go for it because you never know what will happen like I when I wrote to them I really wasn't expecting to get a job I just really excited about the product and what it did and it sort of changed my life to join the company so definitely be proactive thank you Jeff our next question is from Kenosha School of Technology enhanced curriculum in Kenosha Wisconsin so what was the greatest obstacle you face on your path to becoming a CEO how did you overcome it yeah so um the biggest obstacle I had to overcome was being kind of quiet and kind of introverted so in middle school and high school I was definitely pretty shy and quiet I didn't and I guess I kind of grew up with this impression that if you're an introvert or if you're kind of quiet you can't be a leader and it turned out that that's not true so I think I definitely I've learned that over the last few years that you can be a great leader leader even if you're an introvert as long as you can get people to to follow you have good ideas you know how to get stuff done another obstacle is I really hate public speaking and I have had to do a lot of it over the course of years and it's one of those things where even if you're super nervous in the beginning you just get better and better at it in middle school I had no in high school I had to read announcements out loud to the whole like my whole school as part of like my job at on student council and I would shake because I'm so scared of doing it and now I have to regularly give speeches in front of hundreds of people so just one of those things you just practice and get better at so that's probably the greatest obstacle being quiet and being not liking public speaking just take some practice alright next question is from Reidsville middle school and Reidsville North Carolina what do you look for when hiring a new person for your company um there are a lot of different things but one of them is we look for someone who has this innate drive to kind of make an impact who wants to do more you're the kind of person who volunteers to do a little bit more rather than just kind of skating by on the bare minimum we also care about we also look for people who are nice work sucks if you're working with jerks you don't there's no point so we want to make sure that you get to come to work and hang out with people that you actually would like to be around who are trying to do the right thing and we also look for people who are detailoriented because a lot of the the product that we build has a lot of little details we want to make sure we get them right so those are some of the things that we care about and this is a O'Connell hydro in Arlington Virginia on so what inspired you to create a fashion website based on social interactions with people from around the world as opposed to just promoting transfer renowned designers so I mean I didn't come up with the original idea for poly board but um the the reason I was so drawn to it is because it all the style on Polyvore comes from this community of people all over the world I definitely felt like when I was growing up there was sort of this ideal of beauty and fashion that was upheld as like this is what you're supposed to look like I definitely felt that in high school middle school that I didn't look like that and it kind of felt it made me feel kind of bad about my style and so as I got older only then did I realize that those images that you see in the magazines a lot of them are incredibly airbrushed and the camera adds like I don't know 20 pounds and it just it once I saw Mike the first time I ever saw a real life runway model and realize I was like oh my gosh she Wow that's what I was wanting to look like that that would never be possible and it just seems kind of a shame that that's sort of the image of beauty that's upheld so the idea of democratizing style and making it so anybody could say no this is how this is beautiful this is what I think style should look like and being able to share that and get followers and you don't have to live in New York or Paris or Milan to be a trendsetter you just need to have a great perspective on style and be able to build an audience that idea just really really sort of appealed to me the idea of democratizing style great Coolidge middle school from Reading Massachusetts how long did the creation marketing is poly boy take it at what point did you consider your site successful well the funny thing is I've never really felt like woodland truly successful we keep hitting milestones that we keep getting bigger and bigger but then the world's always underneath us so you know the we have a great website but what about oh now we need to be on mobile apps and mobile phones and so the the bar is constantly getting higher as we get bigger and bigger and the and we're always constantly creating right because you do never stop like all the best products are always adding new features or improvements or changes as the world changes so we'll never really be done it's constantly ongoing and it that's kind of what makes it fun like I think it's it would be boring if we felt like oh we're done now we're super successful let's just chill and do nothing so you know it's gonna keep it's gonna keep going for a while I would say now we're gonna hear from Fairfield high school and how has being a woman in a maledominated field how many field affected you positively and negatively so I'll start with positively I think in tech there aren't as many women but one of the unique things I bring to the table is an innate understanding of what email users why I personally you know care about style I like shopping I like home decor and those are the things that Polly Wars user community cares about and I just have a stronger connection to that because I am that user that's an advantage over I think other people who might not like a guy who might not be able to understand like deeply movie like because they're not a user themselves however I have seen plenty of I have met tons of men who are really good at getting in the heads of you know use email use I have also met women who are not good at getting in the heads of women email users too so it's you know there's all sorts but I think that's one of the unique things that's an advantage there's fewer people who deeply understand the audience that we're trying to build a product for maybe one of the negatives is that the people who control the money the investors who give you money and say here's money you know here's your loan basically or here's the money to go build your company that that industry the investor industry is definitely dominated by men and because they're not our user they have a harder time understanding innately our product so when I try to explain to them they might not get it right away and it takes a little bit more time so that's probably been one of the disadvantages thank you our last question comes from ta Howard middle school and Arlington Texas what do you attribute your success today was it a skill a class a mentor or a life experience or all the above that's a great question um I think it's actually a approach you know it's a way of doing things I think one of the things that's made me that's helped me a lot is the the drive to go and try things try and learn even if I'm not sure I'll succeed I'm willing to kind of take a risk and I want to go for it because just as the understanding I have this understanding that even if I don't succeed at what I've tried to do at least I'll have learned something useful and then I can take that back with me and go do the next thing I realized how important this was probably in in high school so a couple examples like those our life experiences sort of shaked me but then taught me this approach to life so one example is my English teacher in high school I was an in AP English or one of the Honors English classes I was in regular English and she came to me she said hey you know what you should just take the AP English exam even though you haven't read any of the books I'm not qualified really or you're not like you haven't fulfilled the prereqs just take it and I said well why why would I do that like well I mean I probably wouldn't pass she's like no just go for it doesn't matter just go for it so then I I did and I did really well on that exam and I just realized that taught me huh maybe maybe you should go for things even if you're not you know God if even if you don't have the right prerequisites on paper just go for it um another example was I ran for Student Council for class treasurer and I don't really think that I it didn't seem like I would win because I wasn't popular I was more quiet more introverted wasn't really very well known but it turns out that all the other I guess quiet kids and nerds like me voted for me and then I realized that hey you can still be a leader and I learned a lot from from doing that and having to speak in front of in front of the class so there was a lot of those two things taught me that you should always take sort of push yourself to take something more do something more challenging and then you'll definitely learn something from it and then when I got to college and I was I was looking for a job I was interviewing and I met Marissa Mayer during my interviews at Google she was not she's now the CEO of Yahoo but back then she was working at Google in the director of product and I met her during my interviews and she told me I asked her for some advice and she basically said exactly that she said you should always take the more challenging path and go where you're gonna Garrett you're guaranteed to grow and learn even if you're not gonna be successful and that advice is what got me to you know join Polyvore when I felt like I've never done started before how could I possibly do that and then when the opportunity comes CEO came up I thought I mean I've never done that before but why not try it and it's you know all those some of the best decisions I've ever made have been when I do just sort of went for it even though I didn't you'll like it was a guaranteed success yeah and I've failed sometimes too but even then you learn something that you take with you thanks guys we actually have one more question we had an eight school that couldn't join us protect difficulty so I'm just going to ask a question if you are starting out today what is one thing you would do differently in pursuit of your career goals um you know what I I'm pretty I guess I'm pretty happy with how things turned out I had a lot of angst around some of the decisions I made careerwise and some of the risks I took I didn't know at the time that those were good decisions so maybe if I could go back and talk to my younger self I would say you know go for it more like don't don't be worried about the risk risk is good um the other thing maybe I wish I'd done was I wish that I had learned a little bit more of some practical skills in college and high school and specifically things like Photoshop graphic design those things come in really really handy later a lot of work requires or can be helped by having a good understanding of design I wish I had spent more time writing and then actually wish I'd spent more time programming at a younger age I think the cool thing about computer science and about programming is it kind of teaches you this mentality or this approach where any big hairy complex problem that you have in life can be broken down and decomposed into smaller problems and then those smaller problems can be broken into even smaller problems and then you can tackle the small problems one at a time and that makes the big hairy problem seem less scary and that's one thing that's kind of the core principle underlying computer science and the that's that approach I wish I learned that sooner okay so um someone just wrote in and that's what influenced your major decision in college um so I I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in but I took a computer science class my freshman year and I just really really liked it I liked the the whole what I just talked about about decomposing problems into smaller pieces and then I loved that the output of my homework was basically a real product that someone else could play with like sometimes this little game or a little email client but just the idea that you could learn a skill that would enable you to build anything like that that was so cool to me and I just really enjoyed it so I thought that's why I was just cuz I took that first class great well thank you so much Jess for joining us today we appreciate you think I'm answering questions and sharing more with us yeah sorry more students to try computer science thank you so much for your time well thank you for having me guys my technology and thank you so much students for joining us today we hope you have a great time sharing this video chat so round of applause everyone
