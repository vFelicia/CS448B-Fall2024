let's take another look at your big game last time you animated the target and danger sprites to move across the screen but when they left the screen they never came back we're going to use boolean to bring them back to the screen so they move across the screen repeatedly in the last stage you learned how to keep Sam the bat from leaving his backyard by using a boolean to check if he was safe left and safe right now you're going to add the same functionality to your video game each time your target in danger moves the video game engine will send their xcoordinate to the onscreen function if a screen ever returns false that means the sprite has gone off the screen and the engine will take care of resetting it to the opposite side just like you did with Sam out of the bag you'll want to first complete the safe left and save right functions before combining them both in on screen
