Hour of Code Minecraft | Loops Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm a software developer on Minecraft and I work on some of the animals and enemies in the game. One of the animals that I worked on is the ocelot and I worked on the part where when you're holding the fish the ocelot will sneak towards you. And if you feed it the fish, you tame it, and the ocelot is your own cat. As humans, we get really bored if we have to do the same thing over and over and over again. But the cool thing about computers is that they can do the same thing millions or even billions of times in a row without getting bored. This repetition is called a loop and every creature in Minecraft uses loops. Earlier, we got a chicken to move across the screen but then she stopped. In Minecraft, the chickens wander around forever and ever. Let's use a "forever do" loop from our toolbox to keep our chickens moving around forever too. The power of loops will save you tons of time and open up all kinds of neat options as you build your own version of Minecraft.
