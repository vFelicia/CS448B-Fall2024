hi i'm kathleen kennedy and i'm the producer of star wars the force awakens today you'll be working with one of our stars bb8 bb8 is a spherical droid everything he does and every movement he makes is controlled by computer software computer science impacts every industry from marketing to healthcare to film in fact hundreds of computer engineers work together to make a film like the force awakens hi i'm rachel rose i'm a senior r d engineer at ilm and i lead the animation and creature development team in the force awakens i'm responsible for helping the artists develop rigs which are the parts of the character that move that allow the character to look very believable in a galaxy far far away in the next hour we're gonna build our own star wars game that will teach you the basic concepts of programming usually programming is all text but we're going to use blocks here so that we can drag and drop to write the programs under the hood you're still creating code after you try the basics with blocks we'll switch you to javascript one of the most popular programming languages on the web to start off we're going to work with rey to program bb8 to walk to collect all of the scrap parts your screen is split into three parts on the left is the star wars game space where code will run the instructions for each level are written below the game space this middle area is the toolbox and each of these blocks is a command that bb8 can understand the white space on the right is called the workspace and this is where we're going to build our program if i drag the move left block to our workspace and press run what happens bb8 moves left one block on the grid and what if i want bb8 to do something after the move left block i can add another block to our program i'm going to choose the move up block and i'll drag it underneath my move left block until the highlight appears and then i'll drop it and the two blocks will snap together when i press run again bb8 will perform the commands that are stacked from top to bottom on our workspace if you ever want to delete a block just remove it from the stack and drag it back into the toolbox after you've hit run you can always hit the reset button to get bb8 back to the start now let's get rolling
