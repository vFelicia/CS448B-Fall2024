computer science is changing the world and we need everybody at the table with their perspectives helping to make those changes students should be introduced to computer science the moment that they get into schools it's just one of those skills that it has to be tapped into early and has to bring out the joy in their involvement in it as it is right now there's very few groups of people in computer science and it's not representative if we don't have equity and inclusion in our classrooms then we're not going to have a diverse set of people who are building these systems that are impacting everybody in order to have representation and diversity in computer science we need to focus on equity and computer science education equity is when people get what they need to succeed there are three major themes in equity work access inclusion and diversity first they need access they need the spaces to be able to learn computer science access is huge every single student that comes through our door has the opportunity to take computer science in order for you to learn about computer science or coding you have to have that access to someone not just like the materials itself but someone to like help you learn about what's going on i had a computer i had internet and i couldn't learn it by myself access has to happen really young so that students can feel like they can take these courses and be a part of it they're not shying away because they don't think it's for them the classes in computer science should look just like the school does we need diversity in all of our computer science diversity if everybody from different backgrounds comes to take it'll make it more open it'll really inspire other people to come take it and there may be a wide range of diversity in your classroom that you don't even know about we have to look at diversity of thought a diversity of abilities my perspective and your perspective it's going to be different and that's awesome because if we all think alike i think a lot of things will not be invented the more ideas and people we can get involved in computer science i think the better it will be getting diversity in the classroom is not easy we have an uphill battle but it is not an insurmountable battle no one wants to take a class where it looks like you're just staring at a computer screen for hours computer science isn't just coding it is collaborative it is out in the world it is in nature you don't have to be in an office to be a computer scientist proving that to kids has been the greatest success for me in creating a more diverse computer science classroom so inclusion when it comes to computer science means that every student's voice is heard they have a handson experience where they feel like they are a part of the class they feel safe they feel supported and that they feel like they can succeed once the teacher connects with you that's when all the students will be able to connect and like they'll feel more comfortable it is really important to build an inclusive classroom and there's a number of techniques one is through pair programming and switching the pairs and having that be very structured another is allowing students to create projects that are meaningful to themselves you can ask each one individually what they want or like what they're interested in create a mix of everything so that student feels like their voice is being heard in the classroom if you're a computer science teacher i want to tell you that you can make so much difference and impact on your students we have had a lot of students that have chose computer science because of you computer science teachers we provide students with the opportunity to find success and build up their own confidence in areas that historically they may not have found success or found a passion having a welcoming and supporting teacher has really positively impacted my experience in the computer science field i've definitely grown since i took computer science in sixth grade and i'm thinking of doing it potentially as an ap class in high school probably go to college for the youth of today are just incredibly resilient and if we can get those kids into computer science they're going to change the world
