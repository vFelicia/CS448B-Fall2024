Computer science has disrupted entire industries. It's changed the way we think, it's changed the way we communicate, it's changed the way we work and it has the opportunity to change the way we teach students. And having even a little bit of grounding in computer science can help you think about the world differently. And getting past that initial fear of what computer science is, is what's going to change the whole field of computer science. Computer Science Discoveries is a yearlong computer science course that covers hardware and how computers work. It covers some web development; how do websites get made, how do they get published. You get to do some programming with video games. We talk about socially impactful areas of computer science. Well it's fun because a lot of time you get to collaborate with other people. And you also get to get some insight on other people's ideas. You can do a lot of creativity stuff so if you're a creative person you might like it too. And it always helps you with your life no matter what you're doing computer science is always there. It's about the meaning of the work like changes that you actually want to see in the world or fun that you want to have, or beauty that you want to experience. Through the act of making something simple you're learning all these lessons that you're going to be able to use to make really anything that you want. There are a lot of challenges along the way but it's pretty satisfying in the end where you get to just stand back and look at what you've done. And choosing to be a part of this is a BIG DEAL! It really helps. It's just like a skill to have. Instead of saying "I don't know how to do it." You can say "I do know how to do it." Subtitles by the Amara.org community
