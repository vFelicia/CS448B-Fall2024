good morning if you are in Pacific time and good afternoon if you are not thank you for joining us today happy hour of code it's Wednesday so we're halfway through I think a lot of you have probably already gotten started if not welcome we're really excited that you were able to join us today and you joining us to do Arco together uh we do have some very special uh guests in store for you uh but before we get started I wanted to share that we are looking for your questions we'd love to hear what's on your mind what are you thinking about how has your hour of code Computer Science Education week been going have you tried any artificial intelligence activities any questions about that please let us know you can do so in the zoom chat or go to bit.ly school question or scan this Q code I'll leave this up for a little bit in case you want to get that on your phones and I forgot to introduce myself I'm Miss Tanya nice to meet you all I work at c.org I'm a product marketing manager and I was also a software engineer so if you have any questions about what that's like being in education technology and being a nonsoftware engineer in Tech let us know give us your questions we'll go ahead and get started so our very special guest today she is a curriculum writer on the K through 5 team here at c.org so she creates the computer science curriculum for elementary schools and she's making new modules for CS connections integrating science and lab experiments into computer science and what's really special is she is the curriculum writer that helps create dance party AI Edition our brand new activity this year please join me in welcoming Emma wind green hi welcome Emma how are you doing I'm good thank you for that wonderful introduction thank you for joining us please tell us a little bit about yourself what you do yeah so I work on our Elementary School curriculum um so I'm super excited today to show off something that I've been working on um along with some of the other curriculum developers and engineering and product team which is our new dance party AI Edition um and then in addition I have been working on our CS fundamentals course um some physical Computing with microbit activities and our CS connection so integrating different subjects like English math science into computer science awesome thank you Emma y'all are so lucky to have her she's gonna get started with walking us through creating her own dance party with dance party AI Edition and I'm going to hop away while she does that if you you have questions let us know great okay I am going to go ahead and share my screen and hopefully you should be seeing the code.org homepage here so I got to this just by typing in code.org um if you are uh signed in it might look a little bit different I do recommend signing in so that all of your progress today will be saved and you can come back to it at any time um so so the hour of code is here our new dance party AI edition let's go ahead and click on see what's new and if we scroll down we will see um a button that says start dance party AI Edition so I'm going to go ahead and click on that and let's jump in all right so we are going to start with a little warmup introduction to what we'll be doing today hi my name is mural Cod and I'm a dancer software developer and creator of illuminate computer science relates to creativity in numerous ways immeasurable really I mean once you have the ability to write software you can put ideas into anything I do it with light suits there's so much you can do once you have the tools to write software and it's the possibilities are really endless over the next hour you're going to get started with computer science and artificial intelligence by coding your own dance party we've assembled some hip music and a team of great dancers for you to play with all right let's go ahead and jump in I'm going to scroll down here and click that orange continue button all right you will be ask asked your age go ahead and fill that out and then click okay and you should be brought to the first coding level um I am going to start up here it looks like we have some instructions so it says add blocks to create your dancer and code them to do a new dance move click run to start dancing and I even have a little call out here that tells me exactly where to start so it says start here with this red block O cool cat popped up and if I said if I decided I didn't really want the cat instead I wanted a sloth I have the option to change that from here um I am going to go ahead and click run to start dancing o you need to add a block to make the dancer do a new move hm okay so I didn't add the new dance move block I am not quite sure what I need to do so I'm actually going to go and click on a hint so if I click on this light bulb here I have the option to get a hint a hint is telling me the dancer should be the same on both blocks and the sequence or order is important so if you're going through this tutorial at any point and you feel like you need a hint you can go ahead and click on this cat or the light bulb here so it seems like um I need another dance block so I need to actually have it do the dance move and before I click run I'm just going to preview what other songs I have so if I go up here to the top left I have my song that's preloaded and I'm going to see what other songs we have here oh okay I'm going to choose this Olivia Rodrigo song and I'm going to preview it using this play pause button good for you you look happy and Healy okay that sounds fun I am going to go ahead and click run I think I'm ready to try this level again Happ woohoo we did it all right when you complete the level you will see this message pop up go ahead and click continue and it will lead you to the next level and it looks like we have another video so this is an intro to AI video let's go ahead and check that out hi my name is hen and I'm head of the music search platform at Amazon I lead the team at Amazon music that helps you find your favorite songs we use Advanced computer technology like artificial intelligence to make sure when you need music recommendations we give you the perfect match artificial intelligence or AI is a computer program that works like human brains it takes a lot of data learns patterns from the data and makes decisions based on what it has learned AI is already being used in all sorts of ways all right let's go ahead and check out how we are going to use AI in our dance party project I'm going to that should make the screen a little bit easier to see all right so let's check out what our instructions are telling us to do AI can help you create fun visual effects for your dance party connect the AI generate effect block to setup click on the Block to get started all right so it looks like I'm going to take this block and connect it here and now again I'm going to check out my song list and see um if there are some songs that I would want my dancer to be dancing to and I see oh I love Lady Gaga let's preview this song all right let's go ahead and choose that song and now I'm thinking okay I want AI to generate effects that go with that song in particular I can click on this black box here and it will pop up with some different emojis okay it says choose three emojis I am going to choose um the crown Lady Gaga is a queen so choose a crown for her um I'm also going to choose I like this uh Emoji that's surrounded by Hearts this song to me is about self Lov so I feel like this Emoji really represents that I'm also seeing that when I click on it it's doing this cool thing where it like goes into the ai's brain kind of opens up and the Emoji jumps in and one more um so this song is kind of about growing up and this plant growing represents that to me so I'm going to click generate since I have my three emojis and AI is now finding the best effect for my Emojis let's see what it decides O Okay so that's what AI thinks is the best effect given the emojis that I chose and it generated the code for us so if we wanted to check out the code we could click up here where it says code and we can see okay set foreground effect to Hearts set background effect to roses and blooming petals and those are these effects right here I'm thinking that's not quite what I had in mind so I'm going to actually have the AI regenerate um some effects based on the same Emoji so I can click this regenerate button at the bottom left left all right so this is my new set of effects and I'm G to be honest I'm still not totally seeing what I had in mind but I think it's not um I don't think it's ai's fault I think it's I think it's on me I think I need to choose some different emojis here so I'm going to click this start over button and I'm going to actually choose different emojis um let's go ahead and choose this fits with the song I think um let's choose that disco ball and um I really I really did like that emoji with the heart so let's generate based on these new emojis Okay cool so this is an effect that I'm ready to use I'm going to go ahead and click use effect and those effects automatically pop up in my dance party which is really cool I'm gonna go ahead and click run and see my new dancer do this move all right so we passed this level I'm going to go ahead and click continue and level four is very similar to um level three you'll notice that there's a longer song list so we can choose one of these new songs I'm going to go with Beyonce and I'll do the same thing that I did before so I'll take this block and I'm going to choose three emojis that I think represent um the song Break My Soul and let's go with this fire Emoji some sparkles and this crown and have ai generate some effects based on those emojis oh that's a really fun one I like the stars that I like shooting out and if I wanted to see the code I can see oh that's called Starburst cool g to use that effect and go ahead and click run bu My Own Foundation yeah all right so now we have a video called how AI works so if you were wondering how AI was selecting those different effects this video will explain it so let's go ahead and check this out how do you think AI Works can it read your mind is it magic is it randomly guessing actually AI knows quite a lot AI looks at billions of data points and finds associations between words with some simple math concepts applied billions of times it calculates the strength between those associations then AI uses what it learned in order to make decisions on what to generate for you so I just want to um highlight something that was really cool that video which is that we can see the emojis that were chosen and the exact effects um that AI chose so black and white diamond and confetti were all were the effects that you can see here based on the Emojis so AI was making these decisions almost like it was Voting like AI was the one voting that and making its vote based on all of this data that it's seen before so let's go ahead and we are going to for you oops we are going to check out this next lle all right the instructions are saying AI gets you started you can customize the effect it creates click the emojis to try one of these so the regenerate AI will recommend a different effect based on the same Emoji so we already tried that one in the last level um use code use the code AI writes and customize it we haven't done that one and then start over choose three new emojis to generate a new effect so we've done that one too let's go ahead and figure out how this use code works so I'm going to click on these three emojis here and if you remember from before we can click on this code here to see what um the code looks like for the effects that AI chose and I actually have a different different button here that's available to me that's called use code so before I had a use effect button and now I have this use code button so I am going to go ahead and use my code and I can actually change some of these effects here so let's say instead of um set forr effect to Bubbles let's say I I kind of like that paint drip I thought that was kind of fun so I'm going to do that and customize it in that waying nice so now when you have that AI generate block you can use all three of those options uh regenerate start over or use code to customize your project even more let's check out this is a video that is going to explain how we can make our code even more interactive hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software engineer at code.org choreographers give dancers directions on exactly when to do a dance move in dance party you'll use code to direct your dancers to move when you want them to so how do you do this think of a situation where you do something like press a doorbell and then something else happens the doorbell rings when coding your dance party you can use events to make your program respond to a key you press so let's go ahead and try that out I am going to in this level we actually um don't need to add any code it's already on our screen so what we have to do is we have to press the arrow keys so when I press left key so I'm going to do that one more time just because that was a lot of fun I'm going to click replay and notice what happens when I click each of the arrow keys left and right I'll make this a little bit bigger so we can see it oops all right there we go so what's fun about that is I can actually choose to press the arrow keys whenever I want and my dancers will respond so if um you like that interactivity uh you can go ahead and click continue and then you'll have a chance to try it out on your own so let's see um what happens when we press up so we can go ahead and connect this new dance block here um I'm actually noticing that we uh don't have our effect so let's even add in this generate effect block let's listen to the song first all right so that's a little bit different than the songs we've heard before so let's go ahead and choose some emojis that represent that song I like um this plant Emoji for it and maybe kind of reminds me of like a summer day I'm going to choose this ice cream and then this uh Rose here so let's click generate all right so this is the effect that AI chose and something that I want to um look at is actually how AI made that decision so if you click on this button up here to learn more you'll actually see each of the effects that AI decided not such a good fit and then at the end is an effect a set of effects that matches the Emoji best so you can see AI is kind of voting here and um these Emoji colors match up to the number of votes here and this effect set of effects at the end got the most votes so that's what AI decided to choose all right let's use that effect and I have to remember that this event will work when I press the up key so I have to remember to press the up key during the song Awesome all right so in the next two levels uh you will learn how to use a different kind of event um that happens at a certain time in the s song um what I want to do is I want to skip ahead to level 10 and this is where we can actually build out a whole song So before um it was only playing the song for a couple measures and here it will actually play the entire song so you can build out a bit of a longer dance party and what's cool about this level is that it gives you some starter code so um you have already some dancers on your screen let's go ahead and click run and just to see what it looks like at the start R all right um something else that I'm seeing is that we have so many songs on this final free play level so we can choose um from a much longer list of songs here um let's go ahead and choose um let's do a good song for dancing let's choose dance monkey so let's go ahead and preview that and I can start adding in some of my different events so I like this um when up press through the key press events and I get to customize um my dance a little bit so when up pressed I want the Moose to do the star I'm not totally sure what the star is but we'll see what happens when I press up and then when let's do when down is pressed let's have our what are those the cats are the backup dancers let's have a cats do the drop and I'm actually going to choose this block instead so that the Moose only does it once each time we press up all right so now I'm going to go ahead and click run and press the up and down key to see my different dancers move there awesome so go ahead and try out all of those different levels and when you're ready you can go to level 10 which is the free play level and set up a longer dance and get started um so I'll run this one more time and then I think that there are some questions from all of you before you oh oh I was just gonna say if your teacher gives you permission and you have space I'd love to see all of you guys stand up and show us your dance moves yeah let's see that Starburst it looks like as if you were going to do a uh what is this jump in the sky uh bending down into a split let's see your floss let's see your dabs so Emma's going to run it one more time I want to see your dance yes I'm gonna I'm gonna add some of those songs in some of those dance moves in here so that we can do it um together let's do um you said the floss let's have let's have that move in there too classic all right okay are we ready it's kind of like Dance Dance Revolution like when you press the arrow kease you have to do the move see if I can make this a little bigger too all right they say oh my God I see the way you shine take your hand my D and bl them both in mine you know you stop me get by I was passing by and now I beg to see you D just one more time oo I see s you s you s you every time and my I like to stop you make me make me make me want to try and now I beg to see your D just one more time so say Dance For Me Dance For Me dance for me oh I never seen anybody do the things you do before they say move for me move move for me move for me he and when you're done I'll make you do it all nice that was so fun I hope you all are out of breath like me you had a lot of fun dancing to that uh thank you so much Emma for walking us through your dance party we do have some questions for you all right um let's start with from Sha High School uh Victor T asks what kind of questions can you ask the AI and how many questions at a time can you ask the AI oh that's a great question um so I I think that maybe the student is thinking about something like chat GPT or some sort of chat bot where you can type in questions to um an AI so far I haven't heard of a limit of questions that you can ask the AI um I mean sometimes there are constraints in terms of how much um space that the system can hold and how much memory but I think you know you can find a platform where you can ask the AI all of your questions um and the second part was what kind of yeah what kind of questions what kind of questions um so I think it really depends on what you're trying to um learn so I've heard of a AI that can help you answer um some questions that you might have with your math homework I have heard of different AI that can um create images for you or create videos for you uh this specific AI that we use um for our dance party AI Edition has been trained specifically on different types of effects and backgrounds and so it's kind of like behind the scenes we're asking hey if we give you these three emojis what effects do you think match up best to that so it really depends on um what you're trying to learn I think yeah and I would add on to that that it's also interesting to think about AI not as a search function or a way to search the internet for information but more of a tool that can help you do things so for example yeah with generative AI they helped you create an effect but uh when they're helping you with your homework work they can help you think through and ask you questions it might ask you questions to help you um figure out what how you want to write an essay or um yeah to finish a homework assignment so AI is meant to help us uh solve problems um and we do that by coding some artificial intelligence we have another question from Shan uh Shaw High School from Chanel B is coding hard is coding hard well hopefully after seeing the demo that I just did um you won't find it too hard um but I think that it really depends on how you're learning coding if you're ever feeling like coding is too hard I would say that is more indicative of maybe how you're learning it how you're being taught or what kind of platform you're using but above all I think coding should be fun and so if it's feeling like it's not super fun then maybe um that is kind of an indication of okay let's try out something else let's try out something that feels more fun let's try out an hour of code activity let's just try it for you know an hour um let's do something where we get to code uh images or someone moving across the screen or a maze um because I think oftentimes there are people who are discouraged from uh going into computer science because they feel like coding is hard um but I really don't think that it has to be and it just like anything else any other activity that you try let's say for example if you're trying Sports there's so many different of sports that you can play uh so there so many different ways to learn about coding and like Emma mentioned like sometimes you will make mistakes in the beginning you don't know how to throw a basketball with the right technique or to dodge a another ball coming at you like you you have to practice and and learn different skills and and grow that skill so uh keep trying it and and and trying different ways to see what what what's exciting and fun to you so thank you so much Emma for joining us thank you to all of you I hope you made a really fun dance party I would love to see what you created uh if you have permission from your parent or your teacher please post on social media and tag us with hash hourofcode maybe we'll repost you on code.org channels and I hope you all have a great hour of code week happy coding bye everybody thank you thank you Emma
