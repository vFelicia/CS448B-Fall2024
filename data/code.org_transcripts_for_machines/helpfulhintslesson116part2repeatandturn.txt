so you'll see here that i've started out the code by saying while there's path ahead move forward if you're at a flower get nectar this will help us get all the way to the end of this path but what do we need to do when we get to the end of the path and how do we keep going until we've gotten all of the flowers i'll give you a hint you'll need to repeat this as many times as there are sides in this shape and each time you get to the end of the path you'll need to turn left to continue moving i know you can figure it out happy coding
