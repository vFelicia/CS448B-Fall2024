on behalf of microsoft it's a real honor to be here and to celebrate the wonderful code.org community um co.org's mission is deeply personal to me i am an engineer at college i learned a code and my first job outside of college was coding and computer science has in many ways been the foundation of my career it's really changed my life but i have to say it almost was an accident it wasn't supposed to be that way and i'll give you a little bit of the back story on that i am one of 15 kids so i have 14 brothers and sisters in my family there's a little bit irish catholic in there that's how that happened um but i had the the unenviable position i wasn't the oldest i wasn't the youngest i was one of the 13 in the middle so for those of you who remember the brady bunch i definitely had some jan brady syndrome but my parents had two rules um one you had to go to college and two you had to pay for it yourself so following my older brothers and sisters as younger siblings do they had already gone off to college and many of them had become business majors and so i just sort of followed in their footsteps went off to san diego state got a job on campus and started my what i thought was going to be my my business degree and one day i find myself delivering a package to the engineering department a place i have never been to before in my life i didn't even know where it was i'd ask people how to get there so i walk in and i struck up a conversation with the two executive assistants who were behind the desk and who were strangely so excited to see me and what i didn't realize is they'd just been having a conversation about how they could get more women into engineering and the sad fact was they just they they tried they just couldn't get more in and all of a sudden i showed up in front of them so these two ladies they went to work on me they sat me down on the clock by the way and they said so what are you studying you know what are you going to be do you like math and science have you ever considered seeking a degree in engineering and frankly to be brutally honest no i didn't even really know what engineers did to tell you the truth there was no engineers in my family going up there you know it was business majors and these two ladies just started working on me and working on me and i remember something that still resonates with me today they said the world will be your oyster if you pursue an engineering degree and the next morning i woke up changed my major to engineering and i tell you this story because it has a lot to do with luck when i looked around at my classes they were it was under 10 and the double e department were women i was i was just there by pure luck because of this package i had dropped off and frankly the the issue is that for too many of our young women today for too many of our young people of color for too many young people all together luck is still too much a part of the equation and as computer scientists luck is not a variable we like to deal with data okay probability odds things we can change but luck not so much and for me i wanted to be able to to change this number and for you the opportunity is there every day we are improving the odds with our kids when teachers introduce them to our of code when schools and districts scrape money together to get a computer scientist on their payroll and every day we can change a kid's life by saying to them hey have you ever thought about pursuing a degree and hey have you ever thought about going after coding and learning how to code so it's really incumbent upon all of us to to change that equation in computer science or sorry code.org is all about really it's all about changing that equation leveling the playing field for all of these young kids it's why microsoft is so deeply involved in the program we're a founding member of it and we're continuing to embrace that vision because every child should have the opportunity to be able to change the world and coding is one way that they can do that no matter where she was born no matter who her parents are no matter what hallway she walked down to get there so thanks very much i hope you enjoy the rest of the day
