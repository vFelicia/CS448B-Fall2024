the sloth will clap high when we press down the bear will do double down and we'll press space it can't okay that's a lot of commands at once but we can do it hi my name is hadi partovi and i'm the founder and ceo of code.org and the creator of the international hour of code movement i want to welcome all of you who are participating in our professional learning we are so proud of the tens of thousands of educators like yourselves who have joined the global movement to bring computer science to be part of school curricula worldwide at code.org we believe that our professional learning experiences empower educators to advance a mission of equity our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core k12 education we also believe that access to highquality computer science education is an important equity issue why because computer science is not just about coding it involves critical thinking problem solving creativity and collaboration all skills that are vital to education and careers in and out of the tech field students also consistently report that computer science is one of the subjects they most enjoy however high quality computer science education still isn't available to all students and the discrepancies in access often follow along lines of race gender or income level educators like yourselves play a vital role in supporting equity in computer science and we at code.org have invested in building equity focused computer science curricular and professional learning experiences to support you all in this work thank you for being part of this movement as you undertake this journey i know that you may be a little bit scared you may be feeling a sense of intimidation about teaching a potentially new subject area and my advice to you is to embrace that intimidation and to recognize that there are tens of thousands of teachers like yourselves doing the same thing we believe that the best way to handle this intimidation is to be upfront with your own students about it and let them know that you're modeling how to be a lifelong learner because by the time they're your age they'll also need to continue learning as they go and try to keep up with new technology the change that's happening in america's classrooms and the embracing of computer science in the curriculum wouldn't be possible without the sacrifices of so many educators like yourselves deciding to go through workshops to learn something new overcome that intimidation and recognize that this is important for your students finally we understand that educators like yourselves come to our professional learning experiences for a wide range of reasons we understand that you're likely expecting to spend some of your time with us diving into the curriculum and learning everything you need to know about computer science this experience will absolutely support you in learning about computer science and this curriculum and we'll present it in a way that allows us to keep equity at the forefront of our thoughts and activity because at the end of the day we all play a critical role in making equitable computer science education a reality for our students and we're excited to work with you to consider the opportunities we have to do so thank you
