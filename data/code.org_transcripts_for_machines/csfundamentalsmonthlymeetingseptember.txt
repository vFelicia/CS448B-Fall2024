and i'm gonna formally welcome you to the very first computer science fundamentals monthly meeting of the year we're hoping to host these meetings um over the next several months for all k5 teachers across the world who are interested in implementing our cs fundamentals curriculum my name is melissa jones i'm a community manager here at code.org this evening you're also going to hear from kiki prattsman is a program manager a special guest joel spencer who's a k5 affiliate and maybe for lucky laura klein as well who's the program manager our goals for these calls number one first and foremost is to help connect you as a community we have hundreds of thousands of teachers across the world um teaching this curriculum and k5 well i guess hundreds of thousands of students and thousands of teachers teaching this curriculum across the world and we want to be able to start sharing best practices and ideas across that community we want to understand you know how you guys are kicking off your year here in september with back to school we also want to give you a chance to get to know the basics of our curriculum and how to implement it and then give you time to share questions concerns and feedback with the group so just to get started i wanted to go over a couple program updates um one thing that you may have noticed recently the costudio courses one two and three plus our fourth course which is um currently in beta you know we've referred to those in the past as costudio courses 123 or the k5 curriculum but we are now starting to use the name computer science fundamentals for these courses it's the same courses same great content just a new name and kiki's going to talk a little bit more about that later on in terms of which course is right for you also just a quick congratulations this year over the past several months we've trained 15 000 teachers on cs fundamentals and some of our other curricula here that we offer at code.org so those of you who are joining the call you may be a trainer you may be a teacher but congratulations on all the work that you've done to make computer science education a priority in your classroom and in your district and just some quick stats here um this is kind of a map showing you where our k5cs fundamentals trainings have been taking place and how have been taking place rather and how many teachers that we've reached and we hope that you will take take the time to find a workshop near you if you haven't been to one already so first and foremost i'd like to hand it over to joel spencer who's our guest speaker this evening joel take it away hello hello how are y'all doing tonight all right so my name is joel spencer i am the k5 affiliate in little rock arkansas i came on year one uh we just started our year two um uh we've had some very successful trainings here in arkansas we've done about um third a little over 30 workshops across uh arkansas missouri parts of oklahoma and uh memphis um i think about 800 teachers trained in those workshops over the years so um i've seen every single question you could possibly ask so you know later on if you have any questions for me i'd be glad to answer them uh for today what i'm just basically gonna do is just give you um some top tips for getting started uh some of you may be rookies at this uh some of you may be uh experienced more experienced than me at this for my background teaching this i started teaching this about two years ago like a sixweek module for one of our clubs and um that's how i got hooked into it that's how i got my students hooked into it i'm a stem lab teacher at a school of little rock arkansas in grades two through five about i see about 570 kids a week and this is my first year taking every second through fifth grader through the code studio course last year was kind of three five so i'm adding second grade on on to this year so i just have kind of like my david letterman's top 10 list for getting started in in computer science fundamentals which is which is now what they call the code studio courses um so number one um start slow um kind of like what i did you may want to start with just one class or two classes um to kind of get your feet wet uh maybe start with the fifth graders now maybe after christmas break you know bring in your fourth grade or third graders or if you just teach one class um just start slow with them pace yourself don't think you know oh my gosh i gotta get through all of course two or course three in an entire year you know last year my kids did course two we didn't finish it and i'm okay with that i mean because i know i exposed them to more computer science in just that year than they may have ever gotten exposed to so first rule start slow pace yourself number two find a buddy teacher find someone else in your district or in your school that is willing to kind of hold your hand through this with you someone who can help you out someone you can bounce ideas off of us someone who may also want to teach this to in your school and you guys can see what's working what's not schedule wise um it's always great to have someone else to help you and have another handson you know so you don't fill out so you don't feel like you're out there on a lion on an island sorry also um get connected with the code.org blogs and discussion forum i'm sure kiki's going to share those with you and or melissa and or laura we'll share those with you towards the end of our um our session tonight they're really good people have the same questions same you know uh same things that you're going through are on that forum and it's a great way to get some answers from either one of the you know over 100 some affiliates we have at code.org or from when someone actually who works for code.org personally up there in seattle so get on those discussion forums you know um look at their blogs look at their twitter page find out what's going on exactly um also if you haven't done it yet attend a local workshop i'm not sure if the few people we have on here attended a local workshop but that's the best way to get started because that kind of gives you the whole background you know you kind of can see the scope and sequence of the courses um and you can see how it kind of flows and you can kind of get your feet with with the unplugged activities which are awesome in the online activities which are awesome also um start small i mean when i got my kids hooked in this we started with the hour of code two years ago and that was their hook you know that was what got them interested that is what got me interested and that's a relatively you know painless operation for you to start with is start with the hour code you know go to the website do some of the old tutorials until the new ones come out in december um that's a great thing uh that you can do um a lot of times when we get new students into my classroom and never done the code courses before i'll say you know what i'm gonna put you on a group of three or four and i want you to go through one of these our code class you know whether it be you know the angry birds or the on an elsa or one of the ones from tinker um we use those as a great starting point in my in my stem lab um number six is very important because this is one that that was hard for me is that it would be don't be a knowitall don't think that you have to read every single lesson you know top to bottom you know plants six weeks ahead i like and i still do this i learn with the kids because i notice if i have a tendency to go online and work all the puzzles then i'm gonna want to give them the answers or lead them in the right direction but if we're doing it together if we're trying to figure it out together it's a learning experience for both of us so don't be surprised also if during this process your kids know more about this than you do because they will the best phrase i heard from my last workshop is that people now you know i use technology our kids live through technology and that's one of the greatest things you know i've heard you know we just use it on an occasional basis and some of us live through it but our kids are growing up now living through technology and there's some things that i'm surprised you know my my own first graders my own first great son can do that i would never been able to do with technology when i was in first grade um so uh yeah don't be a knowitall don't think i have to learn i have to know more than them in this learn together make mistakes together and you'll both grow together um also make sure you teach the unplugged activities i have some teachers who say uh i don't have time to just do online activities i i actually made that mistake when i first started out with my club i thought i'm not gonna do the unplugged activities we're just gonna do the online activities for time's sake and i realized my kids that club didn't get the foundations that they needed they you know they understood how to do the puzzles but they didn't grasp the foundation of what an algorithm is or what looping is or what conditionals are and that's what those unplugged activities they build those foundations they build those foundations for um what they're gonna be learning in their next steps um so make sure you're doing the unplugged activities uh also uh be scared this is scary and that's okay i mean there's some days when i'm getting ready to teach a lesson like oh my gosh we're doing conditionals today it's gonna be nervewracking and they're not gonna get it it's okay i always teach a little fear because i i think that that makes me a better teacher so um so whenever we're doing these code.org lessons wherever we're doing this you know scientific method or this week when the kids are having to build towers out of you know uh pipe cleaners paper clips and straws to hold a golf ball i mean all that's scary and it's fun because it makes it more interesting and doesn't make the day boring um also let your students problem solve and learn from each other when the kids are doing this in my class i am the last person they come to um they have to you know at their tables check with people at their tables um check with people surrounding them so they have to go through like six or seven people before they even come see me because students learn best from each other and um i don't like i said i don't want to be a nodal i want them to learn i want them to facilitate i want them to have those conversations that communication that problem solving that perseverance among themselves um and last one and have fun with it i mean the one thing i love about these code.org lessons is that they're fun the kids love them i mean it's not like what you think computer programming would be where they're sitting around all day typing html or javascript these lessons are fun they're engaging it makes them think it slows down their thinking which a lot of our kids need this day i need these days and also don't think there's one correct way to teach it i have many people in my workshop say what's what's the best way to teach it and i say there is no magic bullet for one way to teach us it's whatever works for your setting you know you may only be able to teach this 45 minutes a week you may have to teach us an hour and a half a week you may only be able to teach us 30 minutes a week so don't get bogged down to the set that oh i have to teach it this way i have to make sure i get through lesson one two three or stage one two three and four by this date you know just teach it when teach it you know however best adapt your classroom because if you think your kids aren't getting enough of it just think at least you're getting something because if you wouldn't be teaching it they wouldn't be getting anything um that's all i have to say for now i'll turn it back to the gang at code.org and i'll let them take it away and i'll hang around and answer any questions that you have thanks joel that was great um i love those tips and i would definitely like to copy that top 10 list you have my permission only it's gonna cost you five hundred dollars no i'm just kidding we're a nonprofit i know you can pay me you can pay me in spice drops there you go we'll add it to your account yes hey so i'm kiki protzman i am a education program manager here at code.org and my baby project is cs fundamentals so i've been working on it since the very beginning and i'm very happy to watch it grow and know the plans for its growth in the future ah no let's go for it uh so this is well the slides look like they're having a moment delay there okay so i just want to talk to you kind of about getting started with coding in your classes and we had heard some great tips for getting started but now let's talk about choosing what you use let's start of course with the code.org curriculum although it's certainly not the only thing out there and we don't even try to say that it's the only thing you should use we we definitely recommend using a variety but here is what we have to offer right now for the kind of k5 level and beyond people teachers look at this and they don't know where they should start they don't know if you start at the very beginning and work your way through or if you choose a course level based on the grade you teach but it's actually just a little bit more complicated than that so really anyone can start at any course in fact even having adults start with course one helps them feel more comfortable as they move through so as a teacher if you've never done it before i recommend starting with course one to see what's up and kind of moving through so that you feel like you have all the necessary prerequisites but for your actual classroom we recommend that you choose based on the level that your students are so if your students are prereaders and they're not very nimble with the computer yet and it takes a little bit to get them focused and staying on task we recommend you start with course one the interface for that is very friendly and it's much easier to navigate for little hands there's a lot less reading to do if your students can read then we recommend starting with course two course two covers almost everything that course one covers it just does it in a little bit faster pace and it uses more words so students can get practice reading and it jumps into math and beyond and then after course two you would go on to course three now course three does require course two so it assumes you've had course two before you move on to course three and then course four which will come out of beta fairly soon believes that you have had both course two and course three there's also the accelerated course if you're doing this after school or you're trying to really just get the entire idea of computer science in a very short period of time the accelerated course moves a little faster it's a little more complex and it covers everything in about 20 lessons now it was built for kindergarten through eighth grade and so obviously it doesn't target any of them perfectly but you can modify it to fit your your own age range all right okay so then what happens if you're ready for something more what happens if your students have done some of the code.org stuff and you feel like they're really maturing out of that tutorial cycle where they don't need individual lessons along the way anymore two of the things that we really really enjoy are scratch and the foods now cs first from google has some great curriculum for scratch it is very easy to follow if you're a teacher it's very animated it has videos and a lot of fun projects and at the heart of it it's still scratch the fuse might be something you don't know quite as well it's relatively new and they have something super amazing coming out and i'm going to try and demo it for you but in case it doesn't work there's a little video linked down here are they going to have access to the slides yes they should afterwards so we'll put we'll put the slides up so that you can watch the video about this alpha that i'm going to be showing you right now so this is the fooze and i went to the foose.com alpha and that's taking me to this little project that they're just starting to work on and this is a level builder so you can go in and you can create your own games using drag and drop programming so if you click here you'll get a new level and all of the typing all of the words in this are autogenerated so students aren't going to be creating inappropriate titles you just click through until you get something that inspires you and i like this ninja above heart let's go with that one so now we can kind of scroll through and we can click edit to build now i'm going to drag something up here and i'm just kind of creating a little environment here so let's put a box there and it says ninja above heart so i feel like i should make a heart i don't know if this level will be playable but we'll see okay so once you have all these things out here i feel like maybe i should drag this guy above the heart uh now you can add programming to the levels so you can come in and you can make it so that when you bump into the block something happens and so i'm just going to say something drops out when i bump into the block so you can program every block every item in this game using the simple drag and drop and then when you're done you click run and now you can actually play your level so i'm going to come through push that out of the way try to it's hard on the internet here it's not letting me go try to pop up and grab that and then i have to figure out oh yeah how to get up onto the heart and get that star and woohoo i did it so i'm gonna do a little happy dance okay so that is i'm gonna stop sharing and we can go back to the slides now but that is just another one of the fun programming environments that's out there so you don't have to feel limited to the things that you already know if you're willing to do as joel said and learn along with your students and not be scared there are a lot of amazing opportunities out there to just blow the students away and make them feel like this is the most fun and engaging subject that they have ever encountered and then i've gotten this question a bunch what do you do if your students move at a different pace and there are a couple of options we give right now and the first is have them do play lab projects so if they've finished a little bit early have them go into a play lab project and just keep building it out and then the other thing is to have them pick a new tool to try on their own so at code.org learn there are all these great tools that have been curated by code.org that teach coding and if students know that when they're done they can go into any of these and teach themselves how to use the tool their education will be in their own hands that it will feel much much more powerful and that does it for me great um we also have a number of professional development options for you this year first and foremost are the inperson workshops laura already put a link to those in the chat pod so if you haven't been to an inperson facetoface workshop please do try to find one near you and sign up i know our affiliates like joel would be happy to see you there next we have an online professional development that we've launched this year so it covers a lot of the same topics as the inperson pd um but of course you don't get a chance to interact with peers or with facilitators when you do it online so if you don't have a facilitator near you please do um take a look at that online pd and work your way through it if you have already done the inperson pd we think it's a great followup um and then just the last thing to talk about is the hour of code is coming um so in uh december like 17th through the 7th through the 13th floor is that right that is correct 7 through the 13th the hour of code is coming do you want to talk about how k5 teachers can get involved for yeah so right now if you go to the hour of code.com you can sign up your classroom to host an hour of code this december 7th through the 13th so even if you haven't done any computer science with your class um and you don't think you'll get to it until december you can start with the hour of code right now if you sign up you can get really great posters featuring inspirational uh thought leaders like cheryl sandberg and president obama to hang in your classroom we'll also be offering a ten thousand dollars in hardware to one school in every state that participates in the hour of code um so be look sign up now uh so you can get updates with those prizes um we'll be releasing many more um and you can start to plan that with your class thanks laura um so real quick i'll just go back to screen sharing here um we have a slide here that i think is correct that has the correct information on it but what this slide is showing you here is all of the opportunities that you have as a k5 teacher as a cs fundamentals teacher to communicate with our community there we go success um so joel mentioned that we have a twitter account now for teachersforcode.org and it's teach code so if you want to follow teach code on twitter we have announcements and things there all the time that's also a great place to post questions or interact with the community teacherblog.co.org is another place for announcements and to get important information and from teacherblog.co.org you can link over to forums and events like this and all sorts of other supports and then finally forum.co.org is a place where you can go to post questions and get answers from other teachers we really appreciate you joining us on our first meeting thank you everyone see you next month bye
