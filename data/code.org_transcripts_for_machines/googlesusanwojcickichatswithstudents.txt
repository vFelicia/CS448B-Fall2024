us for this Tech luminary chat with Susan wsky from Google and Susan was one of the first employees of Google she's in charge of the entire advertising business at Google which is the largest source of revenue for Google and she's been called one of the most powerful women in the computer industry without any more Ado I'm gonna turn it over to Susan for a few comments Susan great good morning everyone it's wonderful to have so many people here participating in our hour of code and our computer science education week and um I thought I would just give a little background about me and about why computer science has been so important to my life and all the things that I've been able to do and why I think it's really important for all of you to be aware of and I should probably also mention I also have four kids um and they actually had hour of code at my kids school as well and so I participated there too and I know it was really meaningful for them so I hope I can make it very meaningful for you too so um um I've worked on lots of different things at Google um I got interested in computer science because I was always like to build things and create things so I don't know how many of you there in the audience like playing with Lego um maybe I can see your hands like how many of you guys like Lego um maybe when you were kids for the older kids the ones uh when you were little um or how many of you like doing different kinds of art projects um any kind of art project drawing Ceramics um whatever so these are the kind of things that I used to like to do when I was a kid and the other thing I also really liked was I liked um I used to have a little businesses on the side I used to sell lemons from my neighbors I don't know how and have lemonade stands I don't know how many of you are interested in that um but as I got older I realized that I could build things using computer science and I could distribute them not just to my neighbors but to the entire world and um so that's what I've been able to do as part of Google um is take some computer science um be able to build things and make things um like image search for example is one of the products that probably all of you use that I wound up being able to build and create and now it's used by people all over the world so it's been really enriching for me and I hope it can be really enriching for all of you now I'm not I'm sure that all of you um are interested in phones either you have your own phone or play with your parents phone um so how many of you here know about games like Angry Birds can I just see how many of you have played Angry Birds or heard about Angry Birds so I'm going to guess looks like okay I see pretty much everybody here has raised their hands um for Angry Birds and and so Angry Birds is um something that has been really fun for all of us to be able to create to use but it's also something that if you know computer science you can actually create you could create something like Angry Birds for yourself and for your friends and so if you go to the code.org website they have some really interesting games that you can play with Angry Birds where you can program um some really basic commands for Angry Birds and um if you think about computers they're really really um they're very basic um computers don't really know anything they're kind of dumb uh and it requires you to be able to make them smart um it's up to you to be able to say um what they what you want them to do and how you can make them do all the things that you want to do and so once you know a little computer science you can be in charge you can make that computer do what you want to do um you can make it do U make games like Angry Birds um you can change how the Pig and the and the birds interact um you can create new games and so computer science overall is something that will enable you to be able to um change your lives in the future and so what I see being at Google is that all of your lives in the future are going to be so digital um everything we do is going to have computers in the future and so if you can learn a little bit about computers even if you're not planning on being a computer scientist um you can do a lot more things and so it's going to be really important for all of you to learn that in the future um for whatever job you consider so I encourage all of you to be thinking about that and to be learning a little bit of computer science it's really fun and you'll see that once you learn a little bit you can do a lot of things with it and um it can really change your life so even whatever career you're planning on doing if you're planning on being a doctor or even if you're planning on being an artist so for example one of my best friends she's an artist she's a muralist and you wouldn't think you need computers but she uh advertises using Google um and she has a website so people can find her and it's because she knew a little bit about computer science that she's been able to have customers and be able to do so many interesting things so I just I'm really excited that your all of your schools are participating I hope you'll all do the hour of code um and if you want to know more you can go to code.org they have lots of places where you can learn about new programs and they have lots of games where you can play with the Angry Birds um um Angry Birds games and puzzles um and it will show you what programming is like and it's anyone can do it um my kindergartener um started out and tried to use it and my oldest child who is going into high school has also been able to use some of the games and been able to have a lot of fun so I really encourage any of you to um to check to check it out and to learn a little bit about computer science so I'm looking forward to doing questions uh let's yeah so so Susan thank you so much for for for for that great uction okay the first question is from Marine Joy charter school so Marine Joy Charter School want to come up the microphone where are you we're right here go ahead Amber louder go ahead just read this we are curious to know what challenges have you faced as a woman in the technical field I'm sorry yeah go ahead we are curious to know what challenges have you faced as a woman in a technical fi yeah so thank you so much for that question and um I me I think you're you're it's a good question because traditionally there haven't been as many girls or women in computer science and um I think that has been something that I've been wanting to try to change because I think it's really important and there are actually some girls and women that have been really successful in computer science so I know it's a great career and the challenges um I guess I would say is mostly that a lot of the people that are your peers right now are are men um or boys but the one of the ways I've really encouraged that and I encourage this from my own daughter too is to find someone else that is interested in it um and to do it with a friend and so what I found is is that even if most of the people that are around me are are male that there's always enough women that are really interesting um and that I can be friends with that I can do it with them that it winds up being a really fun and positive experience um so like some of the people like Marissa who's the CEO of Yahoo and Cheryl who's the CEO of of Facebook they've all been friends of mine they all worked at Google um we still are talk all the time um about different things that we um challenges that we have and so having a friend really can make a difference okay thank you lyat hi um we were wondering what risks did you uh take and obstacles did you overcome trying to get where you are today thank you so much for that question um well probably the biggest risk that I took was I joined Google when it was a really small company uh Google I joined Google when there were only 16 people and they were um I actually left a really big company I left Intel to join a company with only 16 people in it and um I was one of the first and uh women there and so but it was a it was something I was really excited about doing I was excited I saw that technology and Google could change the world I could saw that they their search engine was much better and so it was a big change for me to leave a big company and go to a tiny little company uh but I'm really glad I did and um I think sometimes with technology it's changing so fast that a lot of times we need to take risks we need to say this is what we think the future is going to look like and we have to plan for the future instead of plan for what we have right now so um I think technology is a great field but yeah it does include a few risks um but but the good news is that everyone takes risks and sometimes they work out and sometimes they don't and so um it's very forgiving people understand that a lot of times companies don't work out well um and they just those people usually just move on to the next one and it's okay so I encourage all of you to to try something and to take a risk sometimes especially when you're when you're young like all of you right thank thank you so much for that question all right very middle school and wave your hands to identify yourself okay very Middle School great okay go ahead what is your typical day like and what is your favorite part of your job oh thank you so much for that question uh well my typical day is um right now I I because I'm a manager responsible for a big part of Google most of what I do is I have meetings um but the meetings usually what we do is we talk about the the things that we're going to do next and so we talk about all the different ways that we're going to make Google better and so we CH we say for example like let's think about what Google's going to look like in the future what are people going to use um two years from now or a year from now and we think about this is how things could be so much better because everyone's going to have the internet and everyone's going to have phones um and we think and then we try to invent what the future is going to look like and then we actually build it and so we have meetings where people say this is how I think the future's going to be these are the products I'm really excited about and they they show um what we call mocks they show um pictures of what it would look like and we talk about the users and we actually sometimes go out and we talk to people like all of you and we say well what do you think about this would you like to use something like this and then we actually build it so I spend most of my time in meetings and the meetings a lot of times are talking about what we're going to build and what's working and what's not working and probably my favorite part of the day is is when I see something sometimes what happens to me is someone shows me something about what they're planning on building and it looks so amazing um and so like just for example um sometimes we've been the first ones to be able to see something like I worked on um very early versions of what is now YouTube and the first time we actually saw that and we saw wellow people all over the world can send us video and people can see it and share it and I actually showed it to my kids and they were like wow this is so great um and so when we see something that is just we know it's going to be important for the future um but it hasn't come out yet to the world that is a really really that's probably my favorite part of my job because then we know that's something that we're going to be able to bring to everybody and it will really be successful thank you so much for that question okay next we have Sam Houston Sam Houston School what is one way you apply computer science to your job at Google Sor one more time what is one way you apply computer science at your to your job at Google yeah that's a great question um well lots of people who work at Google have studied computer science there are lots and lots of experts in computer science and that's because Google builds a lot of things um and in order we run Google which you probably all know but also YouTube and chrome um and Android which runs on your phone and so we have um thousands of Engineers and they are building all of those things and um they're building those services to make them work for you but they're also building all the computers that actually support that and enable it to run and to serve for you really quickly and so there are lots and lots of computer scientists at Google and probably the way that I use it is in terms of understanding what we can build next and so it's been really really helpful for me to understand computer science okay all right thank you very much okay next we have the Midland Academy and again wave your hand so I know which one you are Midland Academy great okay Midland Academy do you have any advice for students trying to decide on their own career path let's see maybe we could repeat the question it do I have any advice advice for students trying to decide on their own career paths um well let's see so my my advice that I give to people when they're trying to do their career path is um two things which I think first of all so you have to choose something that you really enjoy doing um because you're going to spend a lot of time doing it so it should be something you like but I also encourage people to um to do something that is growing I think if you can go into a new area and do something that hasn't been done before or you can go into um something that is new it's always easier and so that's why if you look at the computer science degrees um there's going to be so much demand for people who know computer science in the future and um actually even all the people in the United States who are getting degrees there's there isn't enough demand um there's so many jobs that we can't fill with even all the people getting computer science degrees so I encourage all of you to well do things you love do things that you think are going to be important um but I think it would be great to look at doing things also with technology because if you think about the world everything's going to change um maybe even like our refrigerators in the future will have some kind of technology in them or our toasters or our shoes and so um and so everything is going to change and so it's really exciting if you can be a part of that great thank you okay uh hum Elementary good morning we wanted to ask you w wave your hand there you go okay go ahead matter matter good morning we wanted to ask you what is the best part about working for Google oh the best I've heard about working for Google well um I really enjoy working at Google that's why I've been here for 15 years and I think the best part about working for Google is that I get to work with a lot of great people and everyone who works here is trying to do the right thing and a lot of times we have to make really hard decisions about what we want to um like our search results um or what are the things that we want to build next and um and the things that we do they're used by people all over the world and so sometimes um sometimes we will launch something so like the doodle um for example which probably so that's actually something I I first I was like actually one of the first people who did all the Doodles for Google and so we would do a doodle and then we would launch it and within an hour people would write to us was from all over the world about what they thought about the doodle whether they liked it whether they didn't like it whether they wanted it in their country and so it's been really really great to be able to do important things but also hear from all the users who use it and um why it's important to them as well all right thank you okay uh two more questions Simmons Elementary Simon's Elementary I'm sorry question sir okay hi yeah Simon go ahead okay go ahead sweetie car comp car companies have been working on autonomous vehicles Google has been working on this concept for some time what makes Google interested in cars that drive themselves and what future do they see in this technology thank you so much um so I've been very interested in the um in the cars um because uh you know I think this is an example of something that nobody was doing until Google decided to get into doing selfdriving cars and so it was an example of how we could take technology and apply it to something that no one else was doing anything with which was cars and if you think about all the things that we do um driving is one place that we could make it a lot safer because we have cars and the cars um can look at things and they can say oh look there's a car in front of you or um look you know something is you want to go left but there's a car there so it can make our driving a lot lot safer and so we realized that we could take technology we could put it into cars and we could make it better for everybody um and so also like think about it if you have selfdriving cars like they could park themselves um you don't need to park them anymore and so I've been very excited about this also because I have kids who are going to start driving um and so I'm really keep encouraging the selfdriving team to try to to make those selfdriving cars available before my kids start driving um so they can be super safe on the road and I'm sure that by all of you especially those of you who are in the younger grades um you might not ever have to even learn to drive maybe you'll just have selfdriving cars so if you actually look on the on YouTube there's a video about a blind man who uses a selfdriving car and it's a really great example about someone who otherwise wouldn't be able to drive but because of that he's now able to go by him self and do different tasks um so um I'm really looking forward to the selfdriving car and I'm sure it will be something available for all of you when you get older great thank you okay and our last question comes from Trinity Lutheran School so Trinity Lutheran School hi hi um hello um what kind of jobs can coders get at Google what kind of jobs can can can uh can you said did can students get it Google yes yes um well so we have lots of jobs at Google where Google is hiring um not just at our headquarters but all over the United States and actually all over the world and um we have a website um google.com/jobs and it lists all the different jobs that we have but we also have internships for students to come and to uh when they're in college they can come and they can work in the Summers and they can see if they like it um we can see if it's a fit so we have a lot of different jobs but the jobs are everything I really want to um remind people that the jobs we have a lot of jobs for people who become engineers uh but and who want to build things but we also have jobs in every field we have jobs for people who want to um design the UI so they're designer jobs we have jobs for people in legal um we have jobs for people who want to work with other people like hiring or recruiting those are job those are called human relationship um jobs and so we basically hire all different kinds of people but uh it's always good to have some background in computer science and understand how technology works but you don't have to be a computer scientist to work at Google um we also have sales lots of people who work in sales they go out they do presentations about the company so really we're hiring all kinds of people and um I encourage all of you guys when you grow up and you uh get go to college to consider jobs at Google and to apply apply to a lot of places apply to technology companies because there's a lot of growth and I think there'll be really good careers for all of you and that's why I think it's so important for you all to be thinking about technology is because that's where a lot of our future is and I think it will be great career options for all of you wow okay well look Susan thank you so much for taking time out of your busy day we know how busy you are and to spend half an hour with these students it means everything so thank you very much do everyone here a round of applause for Susan uh I know you're all muted but we can all at least see it everyone cop okay right and um and remember have a great time okay have a great time this week everyone doing the RF code uh we've had a great time put together for you we've had a great time getting ready for this uh this is going to be the biggest educational event in history so by participating in the hour of code this week you are part of the new world record and you're part of literally making history we've never had more students try computer programming uh than we're going to have this week so thank you for that again Susan thank you very much for taking part thank you okay bye everyone bye everyone thank you so much for participating in the hour of code
