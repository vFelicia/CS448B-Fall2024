hi everyone and thanks for joining us today my name is leoland bowen and i work on the education programs team here at code.org i have an awesome job because i get to talk to so many interesting people about the incredible work that they do today i get to talk to two scientists who are using computer science to explore the universe dr kimberly archand and dr ruth barnardas both work at the center for astrophysics at harvard and smithsonian dr arkhan also works on nasa's chandra xray observatory and dr das works on nasa's universe of learning and the chandra xray observatory as well hi kimarutha hi so our first question and it's a very serious one what's your favorite space focused movie or book ruta let's start with you uh very serious of course um i have recently completely fallen in love with marvel um you know guardians of the galaxy is wonderful uh particularly anything ever avengers related um that's a recent love um way back from my childhood i'd have to say the magic school with spacebased episodes lost in space seized stars i love it um i love this question and i don't know i know i had more time than routine to think but um i i have to say contact i absolutely loved that movie because it came out when i was essentially deciding that i wanted to be a scientist and seeing the main character in that role was just really exciting for me i hadn't seen that many women scientists before that so yeah that movie was was super important ah thanks for sharing i love the magic school bus as well that's still one of my favorite shows thank you all for sharing that um okay so tell us about your work tell us about what you do and how does your work help your community kim you want to start sure i'm actually going to share some slides really quick here we go okay so hopefully everybody can see um i just thought it would be useful to talk a little bit about my path because i really i did not know what i wanted to be when i was young and i think that's totally normal i wanted to save the world i wanted to be a doctor i wanted to be an environmentalist i wanted to be a veterinarian i loved the idea of science but i also loved writing and i loved reading and i loved just hanging out in the woods so i didn't know what i would do but i went to school for biology essentially and spent a lot of time looking through a microscope before i realized that i did not want to do that for the rest of my life so i wandered down to my computer science department and they very kindly adopted me even though i was not in a computer science program in college and i think it was that connection of figuring out how to use computers to tell the story of science where i really found my true love and so i traded a telescope for some coding and then well traded a microscope for some coding and then telescope and that's what i get to do these days so um rutu and i we get to spend a lot of time looking at data from nasa's chandra xray observatory which is a school bus sized telescope that goes about a third of the way to the moon to essentially observe the high energy universe things like exploding stars things like black holes and things like colliding galaxies so that means that we have lots of really amazing information to be able to share with people such as all of you today and one of my very favorite things that i get to do is to take that information and turn it into something so turn it into an image for example or turn it into something like a 3d print so one of the ways that i like to think about how i give back to my community even though i don't kid myself that i'm saving the world these days i do like to spend a lot of time making sure other people have access to the universe like i do and that includes figuring out how to take such visual data things that we can see and turn it into something that we can also touch so by 3d printing these 3d models of things like exploded stars for example i try to make sure that it's not just people with sight that can enjoy this information of our universe but also people who are blind or low vision to make sure they have access as well so that's kind of what i get to do i'll stop sharing wow that those look beautiful it's like artwork make your artwork thank you for sharing that thank you yeah they're definitely i'm using them as artwork behind me so clearly they're they're very beautiful um and wonderful to hold uh so i will also share my screen and all right does that seem to work properly good to go cool okay so hi everyone i'm rudy das and well like kim i also did not think i would be doing exactly what i'm doing today um i well i always loved science and math and i always loved the skies but i also loved literature and writing and i wanted to be a poet wanted to be a writer and my dad was like maybe you should do something where you like you know have a guaranteed source of income and i was at that point i was like okay fine um and now i'm like well i can do both but anyway so i i i loved all the humanities um i continued doing physics because while i loved all the sciences i was too squeamish to um do bio i i can't dissect um i thought i loved chemistry and then found i didn't understand much of chemistry once i actually started learning it uh i was very confused about chemistry but i still like physics i loved the universe um and i through my life i continued doing both science and things like you know taking writing classes and philosophy classes and photography classes and things like that um then i went to grad school and did a lot of research and jumped right into astronomy and research and science and did not have a humanities component in my life and decided that i didn't like that very much so now i am back to both and i am an astrophysicist and science communicator and i use code to do both parts and i'm gonna show you something really quickly about what i do so so as i said i'm an astrophysicist as part of what i do um and people wonder what that is i i hope many of you have seen this sort of meme you know uh many people ask hey can you like read the stars and tell me what's gonna happen like no we can't we don't do astrology um we can look at the stars and tell you where they'll be the next day but not what they're not any sort of effect they would have on your life um my friends think i do a lot of math i do some math but like i i i like math i don't absolutely love math so i leave the most math to like the theorists um my mom well actually my mom sort of knows what i do very well which makes me very happy but most of my family thinks i'm doing i'm you know creating rockets working with nasa setting things into space i think i am just flying through space and everything is beautiful there are galaxies you know like all those pretty pictures you see in the marvel movies yeah um what i'm actually doing all day is writing lots and lots and lots of code because when we look up at the sky there is so much data there are so many different points that it's impossible to try to learn about all of that by hand if i try to like take notes about everything in space by hand um well i i i maybe like be able to do like a tiny patch of what i can see with my eyes like over my life but i i want to study the whole sky so for example i like to look at clusters of galaxies basically they're a bunch of galaxies that are orbiting each other they're flying around each other they are some of the biggest things in the universe in this picture everything you see almost every dot you see in this picture almost every dot is a galaxy um and i want to learn details about all of those galaxies not just the big ones in the middle but also the tiny tiny ones in the background so as you can see there are hundreds maybe thousands of little dots in this picture so yeah i'm not going to sit there and do that by hand i'm going to tell a computer how to look at this picture of the sky and tell me about what those little dots are doing and now it's not just like the thousands on this picture because then i work with like hundreds of different clusters of galaxies um and there are people who work with thousands of different clusters of galaxies so you can see like the numbers of little dots add up really really quickly and you know sometimes they're like gritting down at you mischievously going yeah i have lots of data how are you gonna how are you gonna process it how are you gonna like make any sense out of me um and i say well i'm gonna use code i'm gonna tell a computer how to take each of those little dots and make sense of it for me um one of the other things i can do is make a model of what our universe might be doing so for a long time many people thought that the universe was just gravity you know gravity is the thing like i throw this thing up it brings it down to me it's pulling everything in the universe to each other so if we put a lot of stuff in one place everything pulls everything else with gravity so somebody put a lot of stuff into a box and said what would happen if we just let gravity take over and we saw that all that stuff just bunched up and this is sort of how all the stuff in the universe bunched up into galaxies so all the little clumps you see there are actually galaxies and i get to tell a computer to show like i get to give a computer instructions on how to show us how the universe turned into galaxies or you know how stuff in the universe turn into galaxies so as i said i'm an astrophysicist and science communicator which means i also get to talk to all of you um and i spend my days and sometimes nights looking at the sky and the stars writing code but also creating things for museum displays and writing stories about how we learned about space and creating fun activities and as i said talking to all of you and i use coding for that as well um and i'll talk a little bit more later about some of the things i do with that thank you both so much jess i'm amazed just from your introductory question answers i can only wish we had i had more time to talk to you all all day to listen to the amazing work that you all are doing um we have our first audience question and everyone watching if you have questions please feel free to leave them in the chat this question comes from mrs bilka's class i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly um how do you decide what colors to use to make those models that you all both showed us oh that is a great question and we essentially tell these stories by using that science information so when we get the scientific data from our telescope scientists will process it and analyze it to figure out what's happening all of that sciencey goodness that's inside those ones and zeros that binary code that arrives in our suitcase if you will the digital suitcase when we first get the information and all of the unpackaging of that information and analysis figuring out what's happening then drives that scientific story so we take that scientific story and we figure out how best to then portray that information because all of this information i'm talking about like the image behind me for example this is mostly invisible to human eyes right so we have to translate it from one form into another so we pick a color and we pick other kinds of processes as well based on that science story and for xray images it often turns out that the best way to show that xray data is in like blues and purples and pinks i'm not exactly sure why but for some reason that seems to be the color palette if you will that best suits that data because we often package that information with other kinds of light with the visible light that we can see with human eyes for example or with ultraviolet light or infrared light and so having different kinds of color codings it's just like having a weather map right on your phone or on the nightly news and on the weather map they might have your region color coded by say temperature or by wind speeds and so we'll do the same thing we'll color code our data by say the uh energetic material or by the chemical composition all those little bits and pieces that make up that stuff and so it's all about getting the best map that tells the best parts of those stories to be able to share them with everybody so yeah these images they're they're not space selfies they are a translation of scientific information from a form that we can't naturally see with human eyes into something that we can either see or touch or perhaps even hear i love that space selfies i i definitely heard that friends i know i think kim covered that very completely perfect maybe two completely sorry but you just pick ones that look nice yeah i'm very passionate about that topic i love it okay so our next question is a twoparter and the second part of that question comes from an audience question so if some of the kids watching wanted to do what you all do when they grow up what are some skills or abilities that they can start working on now and the second part of that question is what were the biggest obstacles that you all had to deal with in pursuit of your current careers ruth you want to start uh yeah sure um well if you want to do astrophysics um or any type of science really i would say first of all just keep exploring things you're interested in um you never know what will spark out to you um math is important but like i said it's not the endall beall um would be good to you know like learn in your math classes in your science classes um if you want to learn how to code um even a little bit that will carry through very well um towards the end um and it's never too late like i actually learned to code pretty late in life um but it's never too late um if you get a head start that's wonderful um and what other well and if you want to communicate science like both kim and i do well then you will need to uh work on your communication skills a bit um you know don't don't feel like you need to focus on any one thing to the exception of all others you know you you can do all the things you're interested in and you know if you want to do space uh if you want to do something with space when you grow up then you know learn about space learn about all the different things there are to learn about in space you know not that learning about all the things that's possible but you know go to museums read books just i think keep learning and then be willing to learn new things and that's the most important thing um there was a second part to this question yeah the second part is what were the biggest obstacles that you had in the pursuit of your current career um biggest obstacles i think uh definitely um so i i was that student in school who like had her hand up all the time and um you know answered every question and wanted to get like 102 on every exam and i did that for the most part but then i got to college and stuff was a whole lot harder and i started getting like really bad grades in my classes and one of the hardest things for me to realize was how to limit myself and how much i do like i want to do everything but that doesn't mean i should be doing everything all the time um and if you actually space yourselves out a little bit you will get the chance to do everything just you know maybe three or four different things at a time so yeah thank you kim yeah i love her two's answers and i would just say for me i i definitely recommend coding for my career coding really was a key that unlocked the universe because there are so many different things that we do with coding to help take care of the gender spacecraft and then also to analyze the data and then to produce some sort of science output if you will and i learned coding in college there wasn't really a heavy computer science class when i was in high school and i really wasn't even aware of it if there had been so i learned coding because i had a work study program to help me fund my college program essentially and my professor that i was working for economics wanted a web page so i learned html and that simple act of creating my first web page and it was like horribly ugly and tacky i loved it i loved being able to create something like that and so i just took that a step further and learned like a little bit more coding learned the scripting language and then went into object oriented program and it was for me that idea that i could learn and keep going and keep progressing um but like rutu said it's also hard to just pick one thing because when i'm like working with people in a team when i'm looking to bring someone new into a team i'm always looking for people that come from very different backgrounds that bring lots of different skill sets to the table um people who speak different languages people who are curious people who are creative artists and former journalists and programmers yes but people maybe that were programmers after they did something else who knows right like i've always really appreciated working with a group of people that are very um different in their perspectives that they bring and so i would say for me my obstacles have been varied but i would say um similar to route 2 once i was in college i definitely struggled a bit with some of my classes and i remember being horrified that i failed a class because i was paying for my college right and so when i failed a class genetics i'll never forget it i was mortified that all that money down the drain that time i was embarrassed but i hadn't gone to my professor for help i thought i could do it all on my own i was being very stubborn and also i was really shy i still am kind of shy and people don't know that about me and it was hard to reach out for help so one of the lessons i learned early on is that that's nonsense you should always feel comfortable reaching out for help definitely do not be embarrassed and it's okay to fail i can honestly say that that failure taught me so much more than like five classes that i aced right so for me being able to fail really was a helpful part of my journey that kind of steered me in a different direction and then here i am today doing something that i love you both talked about um struggling when you got to college and um maybe not getting good grades maybe failing a class which actually leads to our next audience question um that comes from gia leah i'm saying that correctly from the second grade and they want to know if you make a big mistake and you're in what your work is now how do you fix it you thought you want to start uh sure yeah so if you make a big well here's the thing first of all there will be times when you make big mistakes everybody does as kim said you know failing is okay because everyone does it you would be really weird if you did not fail at something at some point and the way to fix it is you know first of all you have to realize that something is wrong you might figure that out yourself somebody else might tell you and then just you know have an open mind like okay it's wrong you know no need to be defensive no need to like be like no no no i can't make a mistake because then you can't fix your mistakes if you don't like accept that you've made them and then just go back and see what was wrong um for example if it's like a huge mistake with some code you go through it line by line and go does it work up to this point yes does it work up to the next point yes you have to systematically go through and just figure out how to fix it and then everybody will be like yeah you fixed it and everybody will forget that you like didn't grab it right the first time um so yeah just you know be willing to say that oops i did that wrong but i'm gonna go fix it now yeah 100 and i just my cat is trying to make an appearance so if you see midnight everybody can say hi always always when i sit in the share to talk he appears anyways um yeah i think it's really important to just keep things in perspective because i have always struggled with failing like i mentioned when i failed that class it was like horrifying to me not only because of the money but i was just really embarrassed and just felt so down and i think what i've tried to learn since then and i'm not saying i'm totally successful but what i've tried to learn is that you have to keep things in perspective right um i was not in an operating room right when i failed that class like i was some doing something that i was trying to learn and for me failure since then even one failure is really hard and i feel like i've done something really bad or just done a really poor job i just try to keep that perspective of you know where is this in the grand scheme of people's lives right and that usually gives me some measure of comfort and then sorry from there it's all about and my cat agrees um and then from there it's all about like roots you said owning up to it for me as quickly as possible and then fixing it because truly i'm not just saying it but i l i have absolutely learned the best when i have failed at something because that's a lesson you'll never forget and then when you can successfully fix something that you've done poorly at the relief and that feeling of happiness is very strong again as my cat agrees sorry good night it's very frisky this morning i don't know what to do about him anyways add one quick thing that i forgot to say um but uh can talking remind me yeah first of all yes it's really hard to accept that you failed at something um my initial reaction was always to just panic and especially in grad school i used to go into like this oh my god nothing's gonna work now oh my my thesis is a lie um and then you have to like remember to breathe and also there's a balance you know accept that you have made mistakes but have confidence in yourself have confidence that your past self probably knew what they were doing to some extent because several times when i thought i had failed once i actually calmed down and went back and looked at my code and looked or looked at other things like i actually did that properly and the current me has forgotten why i did that thing so it is a balance be willing to accept that you have failed be willing to fix it but also don't panic because your past self also knew what they were doing exactly um i just wanted to note we have received so many amazing questions that we plan to if you all have time go over no more than five minutes does that work for you both oh yeah right right into the next great question great perfect because you all have some slides for this next question that i i want to make sure everyone share so kim we'll start with you what's a cool project you're working on right now or have finished recently yes definitely let me um share so i think i was talking about how um i'm very interested in oh you know what did i not sure i selected sound i think i did we'll find out um i spent well over 10 years of my career focusing on visuals creating something that people can see and it really bothered me that i had left out a segment of the population that could not process that data in the way that i had made it and especially someone who's paid by the government where everything i do should be public domain and accessible like i really felt a moral and ethical obligation to be able to make sure that what i had was shareable to more people so during um the pandemic we actually started a project with some colleagues um matt rousseau and andre santiglita specifically to be able to take the information that we had created visuals for and translate it into sound and i'm just going to play a little snippet here hopefully you can hear if i could get a thumbs up so that's taking that same information of an exploded star i showed earlier as a twodimensional image and as a threedimensional model and then taking that information and translating it into sound so these are not space sounds that you would hear if you were in outer space because we can't do that we can't hear an outer space there's no real medium for information to travel to our eardrums but here on the ground we can take information that could be say visual in one form and translate it into another form where we can hear and this is such a fun project to work on we've done about 12 different of these pieces of data sonification they're called or you know space soundscapes i suppose and the response has been just magical i've been so pleased we've worked with um people who are blind or low vision to be able to make sure that we can understand and really make some beautiful meanings out of this information and then just yeah we shared them with the world and it became very very popular and it was just so gratifying to know that something that i had created for a small tightknit community ended up being useful not only for them but for people around the world and that was a really exciting finding that if you try to make something better for one group you could help make it better for all the groups or at least more groups so yep that's one of the projects that we've been working on lately thank you rutha uh yes i will also share my screen okay so hopefully you're seeing this weird looking graph uh yeah okay cool so um as kim said we sh so she has done a lot of stuff in trying to bring the universe to everybody and i like to delve a little deeper into bringing very specific aspects of the universe to people of the universe to people who you know don't usually study it so i want everybody to be able to fall in love with the universe and understand it um maybe not to the depth that people who work in uh astro do because that that takes a while but in enough depth to be able to appreciate it and see how cool space is and how cool just the world and cosmos around us is so what we have here is actually um it's light that has sort of been taken apart if you will um so when you throw sunlight through a prism you get a rainbow of colors right that's how rainbows form you know sunlight goes through rainwater and like water in the atmosphere and forms this like array of colors and it turns out that if we look at stuff in space and we separate out its light like that we can tell what things in space are made up of so what i wanted to do was show people how we learned about that so what you're seeing here is this is called the e0102 supernova remnant it's called that because there are so many things in space that we can't name all of them with cool names um so it's a star exploded and this is what was left over and we want to know what's up there um and to do that we take the light from the star and we separate it out again this is a computer doing this there is way too much light for me to separate it out on my own so i i tell a computer hey tell me how much red light there is tell me how much green and blue etc and depending on what light is most bright basically when something is higher it's brighter so given that this is a little higher over here in the red it's saying that and this is a little higher at this point in green it's like oh this is showing us that there's oxygen up there somewhere and neon basically this particular band of red and this particular band of green are very specific to those materials to those elements and this is how much light came in when we looked at this thing for about two hours but we want more details so we keep looking at it for longer and longer and you see a little easily these little tiny bumps and the computer just tells us hey there's more of this kind of blue light tiny little bump and that tells us there is silicon up there silicon is the stuff that makes up sand um silicon and oxygen makeup scent and that's up there where a star exploded um there is sulfur neon is the stuff you see in like light signs like signs in front of stores that's up there in the stars and we can use this to see that like a lot of the things that like basically everything you see around us even our own bodies came from stuff that's in stars we actually use this to figure out that our bodies are made up of the same exact things that are up there in stars so i thought that was really cool and um i like being able to show that we can spread out the light like this yeah i'm trying to think of a a different word to describe that but all i can come up with is that's really cool thank you for sharing both of your projects and unfortunately we are out of time um thank you all for joining us today we have so many uh we wish we could have got to all the audience questions and hopefully we can figure out a way to get those questions answered answered for everyone who are watching it was so great to hear about cameron ruth's experiences teachers please fill out the survey that you're receiving your email tomorrow and be sure to check out the other class chats and the virtual field trips including a field trip from nasa's chandra xray observatory at code.org cs journeys they're happening all semester long thanks everyone thanks kim rudu thanks
