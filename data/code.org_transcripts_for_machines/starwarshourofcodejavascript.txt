inside the blocks we've been using are javascript commands javascript is the most popular software language for professional developers today blocks are a great way to get started learning to code and in fact top universities like harvard and berkeley start teaching this way but once we've learned the basics engineers write code by typing because it allows us to go faster we can type hundreds of commands without having to find them in the toolbox or drag them out because you're learning typing may be slower at first but we wanted you to give it a try in the upper right corner on your workspace you can click the show text button on any puzzle to switch from blocks to typing code as text in the next lesson we'll start you out in typing mode here you can still drag the block from the toolbox or you can type the command name as you start to type you'll see names of possible commands show below where you're typing instead of typing the whole command name you can select one of these to move faster in my job i use this autocomplete feature all the time when writing code when you're typing code the computer needs you to be very precise you need to spell and capitalize the command name exactly correctly including the parentheses and the semicolon even with a small typing mistake bb8 cannot understand the code and won't be able to move when you make an error on the line the editor highlights it for you so that you can try changing your text to fix it if you get stuck you can always start over with the start over button and you can switch back to block mode at any time by clicking in the top right corner okay let's give typing a try and if you make mistakes don't get frustrated it takes everyone a few tries to get it right
