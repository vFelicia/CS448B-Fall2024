let's imagine we have a lot of fish in an aquarium there are different shapes colors and lengths so we can set up a fish class with instance variables specific to each fish in the tank but what if we need information that is shared between the fish in that case we keep track of this type of information using something called a static variable a static variable is a variable defined in a class that stores a shared value across all instances of the class when is a static variable useful or necessary if you need to keep track of information over all instances that is for every object then it may be necessary let's go back to our aquarium we have information about this aquarium that is related to each individual fish like length and color each value is unique to a particular fish those are instance variables we also have information that is related to all the fish not unique to each individual for example water temperature number of fish and last fish added this information should be stored in static variables let's look at the number of fish this variable called num fish holds the total number of fish added to the aquarium let's create a static variable by writing static then add the data type then the name of the variable num fish and set it to a value now in any part of our fish class we can modify this num fish variable in our case we can modify num fish in our constructor by incrementing by one that way whenever a new fish is created numb fish is increased by one even though they're called static variables they can be changed we now have the ability to encapsulate data within each object like a fish and also be able to store data at the class level as well
