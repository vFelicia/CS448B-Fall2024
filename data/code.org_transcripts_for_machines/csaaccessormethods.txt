hi i'm eddie i'm a software engineer and game designer at valve software engineering is a tool to make users feel or experience or just have an easier life in some way so for me the passion comes from the ability that i'm empowering people i'm shopping online for a shirt i want to know what color the shirt comes in so i click a button and it tells me the color of the shirt i'm able to get the color of the shirt because the website gave me the information when i clicked that button but how is the website able to give me that information in java we use an accessor method an accessor method is a method that gets a value stored in an instance variable an accessor method is public which means it can be called from outside the class an accessor method is written inside of a class so it can access the instance variables in the class the shirt class has an instance variable called color let's write an accessor method to get the value of color the method signature begins with the word public next we write the return type to tell java whether we want to get an int a double a string or something entirely different from the method in this case since color is a string we want the method to return a string finally we give a name for the method we typically name these methods get and then the name of the instance variable we are accessing in this case we have get color as the name of our accessor method inside the method body we use the keyword return followed by the instance variable here we are returning the information stored in the instance variable color now let's use the method first we create some shirt objects in a tester class let's name these objects my red shirt my blue shirt and my yellow shirt to get the color of each of our shirt objects we call their accessor methods my red shirt dot get color empty parentheses my blue shirt dot get color empty parentheses my yellow shirt dot get color empty parenthesis i can also call the accessor method to print the color of my red shirt my blue shirt and my yellow shirt when i run my code my output displays as this shirt is red this shirt is blue this shirt is yellow with our accessory methods we can get information about objects from other classes
