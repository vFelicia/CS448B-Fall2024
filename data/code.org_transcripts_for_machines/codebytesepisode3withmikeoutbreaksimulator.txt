hi hello hi everyone and welcome to code bytes in today's lesson we're going to visit a fictional place called monster town where a virus outbreak is about to happen we'll be using computer science to understand how quickly a virus can spread and what can be done to slow it down and help all the monsters get healthy again my name is mike harvey and i'm a curriculum development manager at code.org and this here with me is taylor my sidekick and coprogrammer for today you want to say hi taylor hi everyone i am in sixth grade i'm 11 years old and i've been coding for around four years now most of my most recent projects that i've been doing is learning how to make and code web pages excellent thanks for sharing that taylor now this week as you already know we're celebrating the hour of code and millions of students are learning basic computer science our code just passed 1 billion student engagements reaching students in every city and every country around the world we're joined today by all of you and so many other students that want to learn to code in this huge global classroom and it looks like even more students are joining us as we speak we have actually a little map that some of you may have had a chance to go and flag yourselves on so let's see if we can pull that up and see where people are calling from today so take a look at this taylor this is where all the people who are joining code bites today are coming from so we've got people all over the united states and we've got people out in in europe and asia as well too we even get somebody up in alaska uh taylor and i are calling from uh our homes in maine today which is up in the northeastern united states uh it's 11 a.m here but it could be earlier or later depending on where you live okay so now getting to the episode for today but we're going to do three things today we're going to learn to code naturally and we're going to do that in a really fun tool called sprite lab we're going to be creating an outbreak simulator using events now if you watched code bites yesterday you had the chance to program your own dance party and that activity also used events so you'll have a little bit of a head start there don't worry if you weren't there for the episode yesterday we're going to let you know everything you need to know today finally we're going to learn how simulations can help us understand the world around us now feel free today if you want to just watch and learn with taylor and i you can do that or if you want to try and follow along at the same time you can do so by going to code.org outbreak and that will bring you right to the same activity that taylor is going to be going through on her computer screen right now so taylor uh taylor's going to get us started today by telling us a little bit about monster town and what's been happening there so do you want to go ahead and share your screen and and give us the lowdown what's going on in monster town monster town was usually a happy and healthy place the monsters in monster town love to wander around to visit their friends one day one of the monsters started feeling sick the monster had caught a virus a virus is a tiny germ that can make you sick the other monsters were not too worried so they kept visiting their friends soon after two more monsters got sick it was the same virus it seems they got the virus from their friend the virus slowly spread to the other monsters who were nearby the healthy monsters began to worry that they were all going to get sick the sick monsters began to worry that they were going to give the virus to everyone else stopping the spread fortunately after studying the virus the neighbors of monster town made an important discovery they realized that they were less likely to spread the virus if they were masks over their mouths with face masks on sick monsters were less likely to give the virus to healthy monsters all right thanks taylor so that was a that worked really well as a story but one of the great things about computer science is that we can actually make monster town come alive by writing some code so as i said a minute ago we're going to build a simulation of that story that taylor just read using sprite lab so taylor you want to go ahead and click continue we'll go on to the the next step here okay so once it's loaded uh let's see what we've got here okay so just a little bit of quick orientation here there's a big green square on the left uh and that is our space where the simulation is actually going to run yeah and you can actually stretch that out with those little dots that's a good idea maybe make it a little bit bigger and then in the middle of the screen there's a gray box that's our toolbox and if you click on those three labels there you'll see there's some different blocks inside you can kind of see what's going on there and then finally this big white area on the right is is our workspace right and that's where we're going to be writing the code uh taylor where'd you go do you want to turn your camera back on too so we can we can see you while you're you're coding i think you can uh leave your screen on as well at the same time is that possible or is it one or the other i don't know okay well let's make sure we can see your screen i can't see that anymore okay okay okay we'll we'll go with it like this then all right so let's see what we need to do first we're going to see if we can start putting together the pieces of the simulation and taylor you're you're in the driver's seat for writing the actual code that we're going to need so to make monster town come alive the first thing that we're going to need are sprites and sprites well what are they taylor do you have any idea what what sprites are sprites are almost like our characters well they are our characters essentially but um our sprites are essentially what we're going to be using in this experiment to like demonstrate what's going on in monster time yeah great and if you're using like a computer game you might think of sprites as being like the the characters or the obstacles or the things that you're trying to collect anything like that the little images that are that are controlled by the code so we need 10 uh sprites that are going to represent the healthy monster those are the purple ones so let's bring that block out and connect it underneath okay and just like that they appear and unfortunately we also need one monster that's going to be six so we're going to represent that monster with another sprite that has a different costume we call these little pictures that that show up for each sprite as costumes and that's going to be a really important way for understanding how the simulation is actually working they're pretty big is there anything that we can do to make them smaller i was just thinking the same thing they're looking kind of crowded so let's take a look at and see if there are any other blocks there that we can use to change their size what are you seeing this one might look like it is going to do it okay so it says set all size to 50. yeah let's bring that one out in this case 50 means 50 so it should change them to about half their size yeah that's going to give them a little bit more room it's looking pretty good and there's one really important thing that i feel like isn't happening yet they're not really uh moving at all so that's the last thing that we want to to do here to get this really feeling like a simulation instead of just a picture so yeah we have this block that says uh all sprites begin wandering in sprite lab we can control our sprites with behaviors like wandering and that'll make them start to do things all on their own so if we snap that let's see okay now what do you need to do what are you doing there you hit the run button around the screen as you can see yeah you're wandering around the screen just like that okay awesome why don't you uh stop screen sharing for a second so we can we can talk to everybody about the next thing that uh that we're gonna need to understand to keep on going so there's a computer programming concept that i mentioned earlier that we're gonna need to keep going with this this project and that's called an event oh that's great great sign there yeah an event so when we code a computer program we can ask the computer to change what the computer does when the user like clicks with their mouse or types a letter on their keyboard each button click or key pressed is called an event an event could also be when something else happens like like two things touching on the screen we're going to use this concept of well we can use this concept of events all the time as people too when we respond to different signals like for example uh i've been enjoying taking my dogs out for for hikes and when i'm walking down a trail if i see other people coming that's like a signal that reminds me to make sure that my my mask is on straight uh just to be you know respectful and courteous to others so it's kind of me responding to something else that's happening so audience we have a quick question for you you're going to need your clicker fingers in in just a moment here we're going to put a poll up on the screen uh to see what you think so computer scientists need events if they want to change certain things to happen in response to other actions or to make programs more interactive which of these do you think is an example of an event all right we're going to give you just a few more seconds to answer the choices are going to a birthday party singing in a school concert or tapping an icon to open an app taylor do you think you have a guess which one might be the the right answer personally i think you'll be probably tapping an icon on the app all right let's close the poll and see what the audience said well most people agreed with you although it's it's interesting to see things like birthday party and school concert don't we sometimes think of those as being events too when we're not talking about computer science those would be great examples of events in computer science when we say event usually what we mean is that idea of like something happening in response to something else so in this case when you tap the icon on your smartphone the app opens up and so that's the kind of event that we're talking about here all right so let's see if we can take this idea back to sprite lab uh taylor you want to share your screen again and move on to the next level all right and once it loads okay great so we want to make something happen when a healthy monster touches a sick son a sick monster well maybe i don't mean we want something to happen but we need something to happen for this simulation uh taylor what do you think should happen when when this healthy monster touches the sick monster i think we should definitely have um the healthy monster get turned sick or well if the sick monster touches the healthy monster i feel that they should get turned to be sick i guess yeah it's kind of strange saying like we want that to happen maybe we don't want that to happen but that's that's what is happening that's the thing we're trying to model with this simulation right and i'm noticing there are a couple of new blocks of code down at the bottom we have this block that says when touches this is a new event block and it says when the healthy monster touches the sick monster now it looks like the next block of code that we need is is all ready to go did you already do that quickly uh it says change oh change costume that block right there now remember before we were saying that the costumes are the really the thing that that makes the simulation work and so when we change the costume of the monster it changes the appearance but it also changes what kind of happens in the simulation so we don't want all the healthy monsters to get sick we just want the subject of that event the one that actually did the touching so this code is exactly what we need already um what should happen differently now taylor um when we run the simulation the monsters should if it works the way it's supposed to um the monsters should um the stick monster when it touches a healthy monster this the healthy monster should as you can see in the block turn to a sip monster okay let's let's give it a try let's run that and see if your prediction is what happens see them wandering around oh there we go what did you notice none of them are starting to get sick as you can see on the screen but the it's as more and more it's like it's harder to control um just like monsters from getting healthy once they're sick okay cool all right now hang on here for a second uh now audience if you've done coding before you might have done like a tutorial where you're going through and solving puzzles if you get the right code you finish the puzzle you move on to the next one i want to just point out that what we're doing today is really pretty different we're running a simulation and the thing that's really cool about simulations is they don't happen exactly the same way every single time so we're not going to hit continue quite yet what we're going to do is keep playing we're going to run the simulation again and see if we can start to notice any patterns so taylor why don't we why don't you walk us through running this a couple of times and uh just give us give everybody your thoughts on what's happening is it same this time or is it a little different um it's similar but i um with the coding as you can see as the monsters go if there's healthy monsters and clumps and they go and the sick monster touches one of the healthy monsters they can get sick as they kind of modeled in the in the beginning of when we first started doing this activity yeah great let's let's run it one more time and hit keep playing and reset it one more time yeah i i heard you just say that when the healthy monsters are kind of clumped all together that they can get sick much more quickly this kind of reminds me of real life a little bit too where we know that like larger groups are can potentially get each other sick more quickly than people who are who are spread out all right so good news the simulation is working it's doing what you expected it to do bad news the monsters are just getting sick and there's no way we can make them better yet or is there i think we're ready to continue taylor why don't we see if we can help them out i remember you read the story at the beginning of the episode and you were telling us about a discovery that maybe could help the monsters of monster town could you remind everybody what that was yeah maybe um the monsters sense we can kind of relate this to real life maybe we could help stop the spread by maybe putting some masks on the sick monsters or even the healthy monsters yeah okay great so it looks like there's some extra code here um taylor i'm thinking actually it looks like you might have already added some of the code that we need can can we um just like we're just going to back this up real quick just so that we can have everybody see what you are doing because i think your your code from when you practice this was already there so actually do you see the purple stripe in the middle of the screen where it says workspace and then there's a version history button can you just tap on that version history button and then hit start over yeah there we go okay this is what what we'll see at the beginning it's refreshing sorry about that that's okay all right so now let's take a look and see what new blocks are are in the workspace if you scroll down okay cool uh so we have these new other new blocks that say when clicked so that's another kind of an event that can happen when the user clicks on something on their computer screen like a sprite so taylor can you since you had a chance to practice this earlier can you walk us through how we can use these new event blocks to give the monsters masks um when there's if you see like right here we could put we press the little plus button and there's a little box here that you can actually use in um these where is it there we go just a little messy um so there's the blocks and then you can take the blocks and you can actually add them to the different pieces of code to make it so when something's touched it um clears that block and when something's tapped it will change to the different things so i think we might actually be missing a block here yeah we need that change costume block again don't we similar to the third round we use the um the the block here to make it so that when that help the stick monsters touch the healthy monsters they got sick same block yeah so and but in this case we're going to change the monsters from what they were to a monster that has a mask on can you see there's like that little white face mask that they're wearing there we go all right and one more now these event blocks you can kind of drag them wherever you need to in your workspace to make space there we go okay so let's see what you've got now it says on the left it says when the healthy monster is clicked change the clicked healthy monster costume to a healthy monster with a mask on and then we have the kind of the same idea happening on the right but for stick monsters did the block disappear sorry my cat just deleted it somehow sorry about that let's get the um when clicked block instead of the wind touches block that's the one that we need yeah you can pull those two apart and then under events the one we need the one that went missing is that bottom one so bring that out and just change the the costume on that block to a sick monster in the green part of the block taylor yeah right there change that to the second costume there okay perfect that's the one that went missing i'm sorry oh that's that's okay we all have to uh deal with well some of us have to deal with cats and other distractions when we're trying to learn remotely it's just a new challenge this year okay so let's let's run this uh and we want to go kind of quickly since we're a little bit short on time so let's run this a couple times and now taylor what are you doing with your mouse as you're running the simulation i'm clicking on the sick monsters right now and as and now then since they have masks on they are not infecting our healthy monsters but we can actually put the masks and the healthy monsters as well okay cool now you did that pretty quickly and it seemed to help the the spread of the virus because you put masks on them kind of right away and only four monsters got sick if we tried this again and let's say uh run it and this time wait until like half the monsters get sick and then start putting on masks do you think anything different would happen i think if we waited as you can see right now um the monsters as you as you can see are going to are getting sick and if i start a little bit later when these monsters get sick it's gonna be harder to get um the other monsters to get them sick get them with masks on because then they a bunch of them will get infected faster and then it's harder to put masks on them when a bunch are injected yeah i i've i think we've heard that from from scientists too that like when something like this happens it's really important that we all work together quickly to try to to bring things under control and even though this simulation is pretty simple it is showing us that that idea that the faster we we act uh the better the the outcome we also saw earlier that the idea of like clumping the sprites together how that could could uh change the way that things work out too uh so this this simulation is pretty simple and basic it's only like what 10 lines of code but we can even learn some things from it now we're a little bit short on time if you've got to go uh that's that's totally okay audience but uh for those of you who are able to stick around we got a couple quick uh wrap up questions for you so now in this activity we programmed using events so let's think about other scenarios that that work the same way and taylor you can stop screen sharing now okay great and we're going to put up a quick poll so which of these might be controlled by events uh and the choices are going to come up yep soon first choice playing the same game three times in a row second choice when someone gets tagged that player becomes it and third a baseball team practicing before a tournament all right and you've only had a little bit of time to answer but look at that 78 percent of people are in agreement that when someone gets tagged that player becomes it it's kind of like the simulation that we just saw too right where something changes about one of those objects when something happens and that's an exact uh connection to how events work when you're when you're doing computer science all right one more question we also created a simulation today of the virus outbreak at monster town so last question how can simulations be helpful in the real world choices are simulations can help us understand the world around us simulations let you test out ideas quickly cheaply and safely and simulations are a way to model complex systems in an interactive way what do you think taylor do you have any uh guesses here i think simulations can help us i think of all of these are kind of accurate but for me i think it's probably simulations can help us the world around us because well it kind of feeds into the other questions because because the world around us you can use the simulations to test out ideas and you can use them to like also test stuff and use complex systems in like an interactive way let's let's see what people thought isn't this interesting it's uh what i'm seeing is it's about a third a very evenly spread you know what this is a trick question because all of these answers are valid these are all potential benefits of simulation so no matter what you picked you picked something good in this case everybody so it's a nice job now that's the end of our show for today um and i want to give a big thank you to you taylor for for joining and being such a great coteacher with me uh everybody that's been joining us on the call we hope you'll finish this tutorial yourself too remember it's code.org outbreak you can go even further than we did and continue improving your models and simulations by the time you finish you'll be able to share your creation with friends and family or even share a message about how to stay healthy when an outbreak happens in your town we hope that you'll continue joining us for code bites episodes um one last real fast quick thing just for fun that we thought we'd share taylor and i have have known each other for a little while because about three years ago i was one of her teachers when she was in third grade and you might remember that she mentioned that she's been uh learning computer science ever since and has been working on uh learning how to make a web page taylor i wondered if you could just take it like 30 seconds or less and just show us what you've been working on yeah i mean of course this is kind of an example of like how um computer science can help make our world like a better place i guess but um this is the website that i created and here's on like a bigger scale i created a website um yeah recently and this is just one example of things that you can do but um on the left there's the code and and then on the right is the the result and so you decided to make a page with things you can do to contribute to helping to save the planet that's such an amazing project taylor and i thank you for sharing that uh on that theme tomorrow's episode of code bytes if you're interested in in this topic like taylor is we really hope that you'll join if you if you if you can because we're going to be learning about how to create apps for good and uh and that's like just just a great example of of the kinds of things that we can do with computer science so thanks for watching everybody uh if you're on social media just a quick plug use the hashtags our code and codebyte so that we can see what you post okay now thanks for helping out today taylor you want to say bye to everybody on the call hi everyone thank you for coming out all right thanks everyone take care you
