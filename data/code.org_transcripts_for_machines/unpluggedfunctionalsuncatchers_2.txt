As you might know, a function is a really great way of defining a set of steps that you plan to use more than once. This activity takes that concept and uses it to help define steps to create a suncatcher with beads, string and a special charm. You'll follow a series of special steps and then be asked to identify skills that are repeated several times. Once those skills are defined, they can be called from a main program and the whole process is recorded on a single sheet of paper. This activity provides a wonderful introduction to variables, functions, and programming in general.
