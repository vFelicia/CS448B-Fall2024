hi I'm Anthony B I'm 16 and I'm a junior at phlips exitor Academy so I'm working with my dad on pencil code I did the um I did the whole blocks to texts and text to blocks component of it droplet helps you get from block programming to text programming and also to edit programs that other people have written in text in blocks if you're not ready for it cuz you can go the other way too the thing about programming is it's actually a community of people a community real people that have interesting ideas that are always making a lot of interesting things and when you learn programming when you learn the craft of programming you actually become part of that community so I think it's uh it's important to to see what other people are doing my advice is always that programming is primarily a creative prise that it's more like art than like math most of the things you do when you're just starting out are not really going to be solving problems they're just kind of for fun um and so you should just do the things that are for fun um and you'll learn things along the way
