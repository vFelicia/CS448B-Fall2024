all right thank you everyone for joining us today on this exciting hour of code video chat with the founder and CEO of tumblr David Karp tumblr was founded in around 2007 it has over 200 million blogs and is one of the fastest growing social networks today so please join me in welcoming David this is so cool thank you for hanging out everyone really excited to chat today thank you and we will start with our first question it is from Wissahickon middle school in Imbler pennsylvania are what got you interested in coding and programming and was there and was there some event or project that sparked your interest for me it was really growing up on the Internet I think that's something that you guys you know I know is the norm something that everybody does but I was kind of one of those first kids who grew up with back then it was like called him line you dialed up to the Internet and it was new it was really novel and I loved it I was just so enamored and excited about all of the stuff that people were making there and all the ways that people were fighting to express themselves on the internet and I think in the same way that some people get really excited about you know the music that they make or that they listen to or the clothes that they wear I started to find the Internet as a space where I could really express myself where I put an identity out there to the world that I was really proud of and that's no these days it's social media is having a tumblr or Facebook and Twitter an Instagram where you can put yourself back then you had to build websites you had to know how to code if you wanted to make any of this stuff and I really wanted to make all of that stuff I really wanted to put something out there that was an expression of myself and so I started to pick up the tools explore the tools and eventually like learn the tools so I could I could make a website out there on the internet for myself and I've had a website since I was probably about your age gone through many many different ones that you know looked pretty bad in the beginning and started to get like a little bit better and a little bit better and my code started to get a little nicer a little bit nicer you know eventually started to make stuff on the internet that I was really really proud of but for me it was you know part of my expression in the same way that you know people wake up and get really excited about the outfit that they're gonna put together or go home and get really inspired to write a song for him for me it's always been that sort of expression awesome great our next question is from bumpass middle school in Hoover Alabama hi my name is Abhishek and my question was what your parents thought when you decided to drop out of high school and create a website they were very supportive surprisingly they were very supportive but you have to remember is that this was more than 10 years ago this is probably 14 or 15 years ago that I dropped out of school now god I makes me feel old but this was this is more than a decade ago that I left high school to start working and the real reason was you know you couldn't back then get a really good computer science or programming education in school that's like all I wanted to be doing I just I knew that I wanted to be coding I knew that I wanted to be building websites and you know I was in school kind of learning about Excel I was learning about like Microsoft Word when I wanted to be learning about all of this new programming and internet technology and it just wasn't in school at the time so my the reason my parents were supportive was they knew that I knew what I wanted to be doing and they saw more opportunities for me to do that outside of school if I could have gotten it in school believe me I would have I would have been there and I would have been there all day and night getting as much of that as I could from the teachers but unfortunately just high schools in New York City fifteen years ago they're just there weren't teachers yet really knew how to program or could teach you the stuff you guys are incredibly lucky than access to more and more people who really they're great at this stuff and by the way more and more of the this next generation of programmers that I've had the pleasure and privilege to work with at tumbler that have been through that education or much better engineers than I am they're much better programmer so you really you can get so much out of that magic education and if you're if you're excited about software hardware or if you're excited about technology I think school is the most exciting interesting and instructive place that you could possibly be right now hey I want to go back at some point I want to make up for all of the time in school I didn't get you guys are very lucky well thanks for that really thorough answers I love just to mention a lot of these students are trying computer science for the first time in their schools this week so hopefully they'll keep going um and our next question is from Morgantown High School in Morgantown West Virginia hi I'm Nick from Morgantown West Virginia and our question is David when you started you were a pretty young entrepreneur in your field did you face any specific like obstacles or challenges because you started so young yeah I mean the biggest thing is just inexperienced going into building a company if you haven't done it before there's so much to learn and a lot of people do at least in my industry you know in this this tech world a lot of people do sort of learn as they go and that's really a function of its the people building these companies or people who have who are engineers by background this technology background and so you know most of those are young people who are the the people growing up with that technology who then go on to start companies you think about most people who go on to run companies build teams you know they start on a team and then they graduates becoming a manager and then they graduates running a bigger team and then maybe they end up on an executive team and running a whole company or eventually starting a company this is a pretty tough way to go about it where you really start from scratch with the whole thing it charged with with running not just a product or a codebase but a team and investors a company a community users all of that it's interesting it was a it is a whole lot to get comfortable with and good at and you're kind of thrown into it you're forced to get good at it and comfortable with it pretty quickly so you know that's where a lot of the I'm just comfort or me or missteps come from I was able to save myself from a lot of that by surrounding myself with really great mentors who had seen this stuff before even if they they weren't necessarily in the technology industry they'd they build companies before they looked at big companies before so they could help me understand what I needed to be doing or what our team needed to be doing or what would be coming next and you know that's that's frankly a lot of the some of the biggest challenges are just in being a I was a 21 year old CEO and we started this thing it was much smaller back then but still 21 I just I didn't know what was coming next it was very hard to see what was around the corner and so having people around me who knew what was up knew how the stuff played out they were there to kind of grab me on the back of the hoody every now and then and say hey hey David you need to watch out for this you need to think about this you should be working harder on that this or worrying less about this that was really extraordinarily helpful and beyond that I'd say I'm managing people particularly when you're managing or working with people that are older than you and you haven't even really been out there working for very long that was that was challenging and occasionally that was interesting in a case really really challenging so yeah the way I think I got through a lot of that and we've been able to build this team out of more than 300 people is really surrounding myself with more experienced leaders people who aren't doing this for the first time who aren't in their early 20s people who are really capable managers leaders who've been able to come in and work with me in the team here to take this thing as far as we've got I think you know the more that you can find opportunities to surround yourself with a great team great mentors who've been through the stuff before have more experience than you are smarter than you you do some pretty remarkable things great um okay our next question is from Cedarville high school in Cedarville Michigan what does one personal trait that do you think has made you successful you know the the the the trait that I most admire in great leaders and one that I've always tried to always find in myself is an unstoppable optimism and positivity there is there's a lot of cynicism in the world right there are a lot of people who think that things can't be done shouldn't be done that you know most people have bad intentions or can't be trusted and you know there's something to be said for going out to the world and getting excited staying excited about building stuff about what's possible and even in the face of real adversity or just the real challenges that you run into and you have a vision that you're struggling to create out there in the world to face that with an unstoppable optimism I just I've seen so many people who've been through so much and yet we're unwavering and that optimism and we're able to accomplish so so much so even when things are their hardest over here and believe me we've had some really challenging moments a tumblr where we weren't we weren't sure that we can make it to the other side and yet we faced it with this this kind of Topol optimism and positivity because we were we were determined we believed we believed in the world we believe in ourselves and we believe in this vision that we had and so we just we put our all into it without ever letting that citizen sort of cloud our motivation or cloud our efforts so that positivity is something I really admire and all leaders really everyone but but certainly all leaders and it's something I've really tried to build into our team here I think you spent time with anybody a tumbler you'd see that real come shining positivity and optimism that's great I think that's really good advice for all of us our next question is from Edna brewer middle middle school in Oakland California their school was actually cancelled because of a storm so I'll just read their question to you it is why did you use and choose the name tumblr ah okay so it's it goes back to blogging so everybody has heard of blogs now but if you go back the word blogging kind of came about maybe ten years ago it was when people started to really talk about blogs and people knew what blogs were there was another little community and idea called tumble logging that you guys if I'm sure never heard of but it was it was a thing and there weren't terribly many people doing it but it was as cool sort of different approach to blog so where blogging was really about articles tumble logging were these clever developers programmers and people who are putting these things together that rather than being about articles were all about photos are all about music are all about links so they were often called photo logs or link logs it was a sort of novel different approach to blogging that I just thought was the coolest thing ever so I'm not really a writer so as much as I wanted to have a blog as much as I wanted to express myself on the internet I I had a really hard time with all of these blogging tools but there were these these cool people working on these cool Tum blogs that I just thought were brilliant I thought were incredibly fun and something that I really so tumblr was my answer to hey I really I want I want this thing to exist I think there should be a tool to do it there wasn't a tool to do it and so I packed the tool together to let me create one of these tumble ons the word tumble log never really ended up going everyone anywhere but we renamed tumblr after tumble logs because we know maybe maybe these things are gonna take off so it will make tumblr for tumble logs the same way that like blogger is for blocks and tumblr got very big the idea of tumble logging never really got very big so we've just since then kind of called tumblr blogs blogs but if you go back to the very early days they were actually tumble logs when you sign up for tumblr you gotta come along so this is like way back in our history that I've since tried to forget about because I think all these words are sort of funky but you tumblr it's a it's an okay name right it sounds I think it's nice it sounds good in some foreign languages too which is always good yeah goes way back cool good to know okay our next question is from Balmoral High School in Winnipeg Canada okay hi so we're from Balmoral Hall school for girls and we're actually all in a computer science class so our question it is wetter than most interesting we AZ sink people using tumblr huh the coolest thing about working at tumblr working on tumblr is we work on creative tools right we work on making it a more creative platform and then we put it out there into the world we it's called shipping code right we ship the code don't everybody has the new feature and then we come back like a few hours later come back the next day and you can see literally like tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of ways that people have started to use those features in ways that you just absolutely never expected so I mean some of the things that have been kind of invented on tumblr that we didn't invent but we made the technology a little bit better and then all of a sudden these brilliant creators came along and came up with were things like tumblr supports panoramas I don't know if you knew that so you can actually post like super wide panoramas on your blog on tumblr and they they get this really cool scrubber so you can kind of navigate it it's neat and a little bit different and when we launched that we expected two photographers to go crazy and use it in all sorts of neat ways one of the first communities that picked it up and started doing really cool stuff with it was the indie gaming community so all these people that were designing video games starting to use it to post these super wide screen shots and posting hold levels from their platformers where you could actually receive from like starts and the like of course that the character would hop through such as stuff like that where you just never have expected somebody to use this particular feature this way and yet here it is and it's awesome I mean it is really one of the most fulfilling wonderful things about working on tumblr the the other thing that I always just love to mention is that when you see creators on tumblr that sort of break out of their medium so when you see the photographer on tumblr or the musician on tumblr we even look at somebody like Lorde or Taylor Swift on tumblr right so these are the artists that we're used to listening to we're used to hearing their albums and when they show up on tumblr because tumblr is kind of I think you guys know it's it's much more its expressive across many more dimensions than just you know just your square photos or just your tweets or just your short videos it's sort of an everything in one place so that means when you have like Lorde or Taylor Swift or the aspiring 15 year old musician on tumblr you don't just get their music you also get their photography sometimes you get their poetry or the lyrics that they're working on and so to see some of these artists where we normally only get to listen to them or we normally only get to watch them act or whatever they're whatever their medium is that they normally get to enjoy them through watching them do more than that watching them use tumblr to show us all the sides of their creativity I just think is beautiful I think it's really wonderful and I think it's I'm kind of in truth I don't think most creators are just a single medium I don't think most photographers only make photos I think when you take bear creative people whether there aren't is code music photography illustration I think these are incredibly creative people who have a lot more to offer than just that one thing so when you give them space to do it I think it's just wonderfully surprising and beautiful cool that's really interesting our our next question is from August Martin high school in Queens New York Oh mr. Karp my name is and I live no this is our honors software engineering program what thank you so I want to actually go into that we all love your tumblr program it's amazing platform thank you thank you for actually in Vincente tumblr thank you over so please and thank you so I wanted to go on so article a little bit where you stayed at the ink magazine you stated that you are a very anti schedule so that's not the essential question that wait that's not the session question the central question goes into your time management as a ultra focus CEO of a company like tumblr the thing is how do you have time to manage that and be a creative software developer oh man so you're touching on to things that are just heartbreaking to me so one is that I don't really get to write code at Tumblr anymore which is actually a really shitty part about like building stuff like this is that at some point you start working with people who are much smarter than you are who and many more of them than you and it starts to be the right thing to do to sort of pass the torch and let them be the ones to build tumblr to make it all the stuff that it can be so you know my role here is really shifted from committing code every day to sort of being chief motivator so I'm the the guy just making sure that everybody excited about the vision the direction that they know what the direction is and they feel empowered to make tumblr everything that they can be and you know it was it was very heartbreaking in the beginning it was very hard to let go of that but then you step back and you see how much more were able to do and you see us putting the stuff out there into the world that we're all just so so proud of and you didn't I get to come to work with you brilliant people I'm certainly not bitter about it but it has been a little bit heartbreaking to let go of I do still by the way find like little projects here and there but it's definitely not my day job anymore on that first part of your question though you know the this is something else that I was very stubborn about for a long time I really didn't like having a regimented calendar because I loved to just sort of be able to flow between projects certainly if you guys have worked on the coding projects before you know there's like a real flow that you get into sometimes and it sucks to interrupt that flow and so I for a long time really did insist on not scheduling anything and now that you know the team has grown to more than three hundred people and we have have investors or now we have our parent company I kind of had to just swallow it and now I have a pretty pretty busy calendar which is fine but it's a little bit different so it took me a few years though first few years of tumblr still writing code no calendar we got an awful lot done we're getting more done these days awesome great we have one last question from let's screen high school in time my name is Katie Skinner and our question is what are some emerging platforms or technologies you think are really exciting Nana um to tell you to show of hands real quick I'm very curious do any of your computer labs have 3d printers yet which of you guys have gotten to alright I see one alright looks like there are a couple of them so I man if you have a chance these things have started to get like not cheap but affordable enough that like more and more schools are starting to have them you can even find like services that'll ship stuff to you or local maker spaces that'll have printers that you can borrow 3d printing is I should just say 3d technology right now is like were olds ahead of where it was when I was growing up and I got to tell you I mean I so badly wanted to do 3d stuff I wanted to like make incredible technology but the tools were so so hard when I was growing up so as I've kind of gotten back to that in the last couple years just to sort of see what's going on the thing that's most remarkable to me is the software is good it's easy a lot of its free and you can go on YouTube and like watch a twominute video on how to do this like super hard advanced thing see it and then like turn around and do it yourself so the software isn't like an incredibly empowering place right now or where all of you guys at home can go and download 3d design software for free get easy tutorials like get rolling with anything from like yeah character design and animation to mechanical like product designs to a technical hardware design you pair that with I imagine some of you guys have heard of or played with Arduinos these uh microcontrollers need to be small little electronic boards that let you go from not just designing a physical product but actually designing a consumer electronic product that does everything from like whites up to controlling a drone I mean really whatever whatever you can do with electricity and then you add these 3d printers that let you design or download an object from the internet I mean that was the most empowering crazy thing to me the first time I downloaded something from the internet and then had it in my hands 30 minutes later so I don't know I am as excited about technology as I've ever been the 3d stuff I just think isn't you know the the whole arm bread and butter at tumblr is empowering creators I think this 3d stuff right now some of the most empowering creative technology that's come along in a while and I'm incredibly excited to see how creators use it and I'm incredibly excited to see how inventors and technologists use it and a lot of friends who are working on some of the companies I'm most excited about right now are using a lot of that technology and the truth is you can have one or two people sitting there with this very powerful software design and stuff prototyping into the printer that's sitting on their desk and take it to market and fabricate millions of these things with a process that like any of you guys can do right now it's pretty I think it's a pretty remarkable moment in technology so if you haven't had a chance yet I'd go screw around with the software I use I mostly use Mac so the the Mac software that I use is called a rhinoceros or rhino3d you can download that one for free I think it cost something on Windows but they're all that there's other free software you can use on Windows find a makerspace or convince your school to get a 3d printer and you'll be off to the races I think that stuff is really really cool really exciting it's really fun to work with cool technology guys thank you so much for the great questions this is so much fun thank you again for joining us and we actually have one more question that we put out a call for on our own tumblr so code.org on tumblr we get questions every r messages every single day with and our most common question is basically I want to learn how to code I want to build an app or something cool but where do I start and I think everyone here is sort of on a different level of their journey so why not ask David himself so I'm not really speaking from experience you know I started doing web development so that was sort of like HTML and then Perl and then PHP so I don't even know if these are things that any of you guys like don't hear these days but the sort of safe suggestion I always make to people who are excited to start making soft you know whatever that is they want to make games they want to make apps is to pick up either the Android or the iOS the objectivec books or toolkits the really great thing about doing the app stuff so so making an app for your your iPhone or your Android phone is the code the programming and the developer kits are really very contained they're very there it's still it's still programming it's a lot to learn if you're new or doing it for the first time but you go to Apple's website and you download the software get a book and like one book and tell you how to create a whole app and you kind of read the book forwards back you you make your your own first app and you load it onto that that phone that you have and you're like kind of off to the races so the one challenge with web development is there's there's a lot involved isn't just writing code it's often how to set up a domain name come by and set up a your own calm how to point that at a server how to set up a server how to upload to write your code and then how to upload it to the server there's a little bit more involved where when you down when you start active element you kind of get the book you download the the tools and you're kind of off to the races so if you're if you're excited to get started with this stuff if you have friends or family who are excited to get started with the stuff one of the easiest things you can do is just go on Amazon look for the Android or iPhone programming books that have the best review of reviews grab the book and like jump into that thing and you'll come out the other side with a mobile game or a mobile app and a lot of the skills that you need to build a website or build a whole lot of other software to you guys will do fine best of luck really guys and when you're looking for gigs tumblr.com slash jobs we're always hiring great engineers so please look us up when you're when you're on your way out of MIT nice I'm sure that's really exciting I know we have a lot of tumblr fans here today so everyone please just join me in thanking David again for joining us and giving so much insight
