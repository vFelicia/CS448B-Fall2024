this puzzle might look a lot harder than what you're used to but if you say it out loud it's really not that difficult it is a rectangle so at first it looks like we might need to do something different for the long sides than for the short sides but if you look closely you'll see that we have a wild path ahead block here that means that while there's a path ahead we can move forward checking for flowers and getting nectar what do we do when we get to the end of the path how many times do we need to repeat that i know you can figure it out good luck
