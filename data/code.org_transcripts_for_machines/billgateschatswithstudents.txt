Bill does not need any introduction for me uh anything to say would be worth by his own presence so there he is let me uh let me turn on him on the video here and uh there you go so there he is waiting for us and we're gonna start awesome we're gonna start with Parma so let me switch to your camera Parma and you can ask the first question go ahead um thank you proba for education and my question is what personality tra do you think is most beneficial to success you catch that bill yeah no that's a great question um I think probably persistence is the thing that makes the biggest difference I mean it's great to be interested in Reading uh it's great to be curious you but everybody has has some of those things if you can pick something and you know really push yourself to understand it very very well uh and persist I remember in in a lot of things I do I get to a point where I think I'm fairly good and then I find out that you know maybe I could be a lot better as several times people would look at my code tell me it wasn't very good uh and yet you know to take that feedback and have it engage you to just push harder try harder I I think you know confidence persistence are pretty i' put at the the top of the list all right thank you Bill okay the next question is coming from o hope I'm pronouncing right aagi middle school and let me bring you guys up aagi Middle School go ahead what emerging technology today do you think will cause a major change in how we live in the world you cat that bill yeah uh yeah I think the biggest thing is that you know we thought of computers with these things that sit on a desk and you have a mouse and keyboard uh or you know a phone in your pocket as the computer is able to see that is its Vision through very cheep cameras and its ability to listen to understand uh speech for example gets better then Computing becomes kind of pervasive and you even put those vision and listing capabilities on robot type devices and as the software gets smarter and smarter uh to use that vision and anticipate you know to see what's going on then it's it's kind of amazing what computers can do I uh you know there's really no limit uh to their ability to both help us and do things on their own and some people even worry that they'll get they'll get too capable but we the progress right now on things like speech and vision and and learning type technology that companies like Microsoft and Google and others are driving is quite amazing so computers won't be just this desktop thing uh in the future sure okay thank you okay the next question is coming from Galactic uh Galactic uh this a fifth grade class go ahead who is your role model and why yeah I I wouldn't say I just had anyone role model I mean certainly uh you know my parents you know were hardworking and and set an example for me uh eventually I got to meet some scientists who would just dig into their topic and in their life learning it realizing what they didn't know and always pushing themselves to understand more people like Richard fman was a physicist I got to meet Warren Buffett who always thought about stocks and businesses and how how they got profitability and just lived his life to really understand that very very well and I read a lot of biographies and autobiographies so you know uh Lincoln uh is an inspiring story uh Franklin Del Rose develops an inspiring story uh and a lot of people have dealt with very tough situations and and done well so I think reading LW of biographies and taking nuggets of how people manage to make a a huge difference and then you know as much as possible spend more time with people you admire and try to understand what is it about them uh that makes them you know so great and you know it won't just be their intelligence it'll be their uh their their personality okay thank you Bill okay we have Santa Fe Santa Fe Trails here Santa Fe Trail uh Middle School um what why did you start um G Foundation but I was very lucky that the Microsoft success created a lot of wealth uh and so the question is you know what what should I do so that most beneficial and you know at first of course you can buy you know uh some some more books or go on nice trips and things but the scale is Way Beyond any reasonable personal consumption and so if you decide that having your kids have that huge wealth would not be beneficial to them then you think okay where should it Go and that's where I started studying about poor countries and uh why so many kids in poor countries are still buying uh diseases that we pretty much eliminated diarrhea and pneumonia malaria and I decided hey I love science I love Innovation let's make sure that Innovation is working as much as possible to help the forest in the world and so that's about 70% of what we do in the foundation and you know I've gotten to learn new things it's a lot of fun and 30% is helping with us education trying to figure out how we can help teachers uh do an even better job of educating kids in in this country okay thank you okay next we have the Jewish Community High School how do you think online learning will affect education in the next 5 to 10 I'm very excited about online learning uh the idea that you can have the world's best lecture just there uh at your fingertips it's a quite a phenomenal thing because the best lecture in terms of making the subject interesting understandable are so much better than the average lecture and then of course you can create communities we can interact we can do try problem sets work together get advice from people you I think every student should know their math skills how good they are right now you know you kind of take a task and get the single score but understanding what areas to kind of weak in what materials are out there to help you improve uh you know you personally should have that online learning profile and be advised how you can how you can get better and so I don't think it'll replace teachers in classrooms in uh the high school area but once you get up to College selfdirected learning will be a a much much uh bigger thing and so our foundation's the Big Thunder of all these online courses and seeing what kind of students they work for and blending so it's not just online versus traditional classroom but we using online and the traditional classroom trying to get the best of both worlds there so it's pretty exciting already things like P that I hope a lot of you have played around with for math type things uh a few dozen sites like that really are starting to make the difference well I just want to add I have to add right now quickly that the whole hour of code is an online learning that wouldn't even is impossible about the internet so getting you know hopefully 10 million kids this uh week learning the code for the first time is going to be a fantastic application of online learning so that's my my own little plug there let's go to the Jewish next we have uh it's a central Jersey College Prep y um hello Gates it is just an honor to be speaking to you today um my question is that can you give us an example of a time when a kid has given you useful advice that has made a difference in your life well certainly uh it keeps me you know press and uh thinking about things in a in a good way to have children I children 17 uh 14 11 and you know they like some Microsoft products they you know give me feedback of how we could improve some of those products and just the whole way that they see the internet and you know take it for granted which of course at their age when I was their age there was no internet and you know I also get to go out to schools and talk to students about things like online what you know did they think it's relevant to them or is it just you know not yet in a form that makes a difference for that so going out talking with students uh is fantastic I always meet with the summer interns that that work I did it at Microsoft every year I do it now at the foundation uh as they come in with a fresh view of you know how what's do they think is new and exciting how do they think the organization could be better and so the fresh Innovative eyes of young people are really where a lot of the the Improvement can take place and you never want to uh lose touch with that so uh you know kids think in a in a un unconstrained open way thank you very much sir and hopefully this is not the only time great all right we have Freedom Elementary hey who's G ask your question your traffic count program was your first program ever you ever sold in the era of four computers were how did you know your product would be successful yeah so the the very first thing I got paid for was kind of an obscure thing which is that they measure how much traffic R roads to understand when to do maintenance and how to change the traffic lights whether to put in a traffic light um they they would put a rubber hose across the road and and it would see the cars going by and then there'd be a counter in a metal box and it would punch out a paper tape with the every 15 minutes the traffic counts of of how many axles how many cars went over that uh the hose and then they would need somebody to take that and print it out and figure out what the tends and the Peaks and various things like that were and they were using these really expensive computers and we charged several hundred dollar for it and so my friends and I took the first computer on a chip and wire wrapped it together there were no personal computers and created a machine that was designed to print out these charts and so it's a very very limited machine like a million times as powerful as the the phone that all of you probably uh uh either have or will will have but it was enough to do that so we got paid we charged them like $30 for they paid like $100 so even though we were kids and they weren't quite sure about us we sent the stuff back it looked accurate our price was a lot lower uh never got to be a huge business but we made about three or 4,000 a year for about three years there and that was the money that I took that let me uh start Microsoft without having any income while we were doing the very first program development great thank you okay and I believe I don't have a question for Academy of Aerospace so I'm going to go on to Burbank and uh B High scho bring you up here hold on hey Bing go ahead um my question is if you can travel back in time and talk to your own yourself and give yourself an advice what would it be and why well there's a lot of fascinating periods in history um you know there's people like gang shaing and who reformed what was going on in very difficult uh there's you know some amazing us leaders that understand understanding uh like how Lincoln thought about things in the very difficult things he had to go go through and how he was able to you know build teams of people and keep a focus on the the good principles um you know if you could go back enough in time understanding the uh you know what happened 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs died out you know seeing all that cataclysm and uh how the Earth was different that would be pretty cool in terms of understanding Natural History uh so it it'd be nice to have a time machine uh I'm amazed how much we can learn about the path without actually being able to go back there just by looking at the the the way scientists now gather information it's it's amazing but it's not as good as as if if we could actually go back great and then Bill since we have five minutes left you have any just comments for the kids who are about many of them are going to be learning programming for the very first time this week in their first hour of code I think the um I go back to the point about persistence which is that you know the idea of a program and variables and you know if statements and data structure at first it's kind of confusing but then after you see a few of them you know then you kind of get the sense of how it works and and it's fun when you write a program you know at first it doesn't work and then you get it to work uh there's a real sense of satisfaction that comes out of that and you know it really is you just have to you know persist in find different things out and make a lot of mistakes in it uh but it it can be very gratifying even if you don't end up going into something related to programming understanding programming will give you a sense of how computers work what they can do what they can't do and if people have a mysterious sense of well maybe they can do everything but of course that's that's not true there're just certainly in today's Incarnation a very very very limited tools so you know I think programming can be fun it'll help with do logical thinking uh you know it's for everyone you know not just uh boys or not just math Geeks you know everybody uh can enjoy it and uh there's some you know great programs that you'll have a chance to do and for people who who choose to make a career of it it it's a phenomenal thing uh that you get to build these these products and and work on very tough problems uh so you know you you are the future workers of the country and the more you know about software and coding then the better off we'll be great you mentioned persistence I just wanted to recognize before we close today one of the groups here were snowed out that a snow day and they actually gaed a teacher house in order to chat with you so I just want to recognize this class which is at home at a teacher home uh to make sure they could uh make their chat with you today so thank you very much Bill we all have a round of applause un microphones everyone all have a round of applause for for Bill Gates and thank him for Microsoft long dinner with you at your house back in 1993 so thank you very much for also helping me on the path to great so thank you very much thanks everyone bye bye
