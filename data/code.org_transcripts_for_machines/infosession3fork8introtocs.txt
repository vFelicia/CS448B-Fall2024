hi everyone we are here for our third info session on code orgs intro to computer science course thanks for joining us again we really appreciate you coming to take your time and learning more about our course so my name is Katie apone and I'm the K through 8 program manager here at code.org and also today with me we have Roxanne she does our social media and we have known who is one of our engineers who has worked on blockley and worked extensively on this K through H intro to computer science course so today is the third session and we'll be covering the teacher dashboard support for teachers and any kind of miscellaneous questions you haven't had answered over these past three sessions so please keep asking questions and we'll get to them when we can so the first session covered the unplugged activities and the second session covered the blockley puzzles so if you have questions about those feel free to go and watch those sessions that are on our Google+ page and they're also listed on our website I definitely encourage everyone to watch the first session especially on the unplugged lessons because it might be easy to skip over the unplug lessons while following through the course but I think it's a great chance for your kids to get some handson experience and really work with others on computer science concepts so I highly recommend going and watching about the unplugged activities and seeing how they play out in your classroom they're really fun with students also we will be giving away a fifty dollars donor choose gift card to one US public school teacher who asks questions during these sessions so if we get your questions and questions in and we'll contact one teacher after these sessions are finished so why don't we just dive right into some logistics of the online setup of our learning platform we can look at some of the different links fair so I'm going to start a screen share so we can see what it looks like the first page that I have pulled up here is just code org slash educate / 20 hour 20 HR so it's on our website and it has a overview of the 20hour course it has a link directly to teacher signups it tells you how to get started it has info about these info sessions it has information about some of our classroom rewards and it goes into overviews of this course tells you what's in this course and it gives you some information about how to prep for the course and during the lessons what you can do during the lessons and it also mentions that it's one hundred percent free who are nonprofit so we want to make sure that all of our materials are spread around and used widely by teachers and they also we also have links to our forums here so you can ask questions on our forum and you can also give us feedback or suggestions rather so you can find a lot of great information here and let's look at to the teacher sign up so there are a couple different ways you can sign up as a teacher you just go to code org you can hit the sign in button well tells me I'm already signed in but it would normally take you to the signup page or the sign in page and it says on the right if you haven't joined yet sign up so this is how you would sign up as a teacher and then you can click this are you a teacher button when you come to this sign up page another way to sign up a tu as a teacher if is if you go to learn code org there's some signin options right under the banner it says so you can sign up as a student or sign up as a teacher so once you're signed up as a teacher you'll wanted to sign up your students so if your students have email addresses they can sign up here which is the sign sign up page we just saw so you can fill out information and sign up as a student with an email address oh I change I wanted what's rejected all right so let's also take a look at a different way to sign up as a student which is through the join link so students don't need an email for this option and to do that you'll sign in to your teacher account and you'll want to head to starting switching tabs around your lap you'll want so when your sign in to your teacher account you want to head to manage sections well sign in so under manage sexings you can add a section so say I wanted to add my fourthgrade classroom as a section and i will say create section so here under section it says fourthgrade classroom and it says add students using section code so this is the section code for this classroom I'm going to copy this it's just a six letter code so then when my students come into class they can go to you'll have them head to code org slash join so for students to sign up without an email they'll come to code or flash join and you can write your section code up on the board and you can have them enter it they'll press GO and then they'll actually fill out another page that says sign up as it asks you for a username and a password and I think that's about it sorry I was signed in when I did that so let me just do that again just to look at what we would fill out okay so it says register to join the class fourth grade classroom taught by meet Katie apone so your students can enter their full name Katie apone this is the spot for their username so they'll enter a username there they'll pick a password and then they can enter if they're male or female if they want and then they can into their birthday if they like um the reason we ask we just asked for a couple of bits of information if you are interested in getting some of the donor choose classroom rewards make sure that your students fill out this gender field that's important so then as a teacher I can look at all the information for the students that are associated with me so I can head to the manage students link and sorry about all this sign in/sign out issues so I can go to my manage students link and I can see all of the all these are all of my students so the students that have you that have become my students using the join code the the option to use without an email I can i can click on this edit password so i can edit their password if they joined using that join code if they signed up using an email address i can't edit their password for them and it will tell me which section there in if i wanted to move them to a different section i could click on their name and say move this student to a fourth grade classroom and it will sign them to that section if we head over to the progress dashboard we can see these are the trophies that the students have collected so we can see that laura has won the silver trophy and the sequence concept Laura's won the bronze trophy in the if concept and these are the puzzle she has completed so you can see the level key up here the the green checkmark means it's completed and using the optimal number of blocks and this kind of lighter green is that they completed it but they used too many blocks and the purple means that they try the puzzle but they have not completed it yet and the white means that they haven't tried it yet so we can use the scroll bar at the bottom to see all of the puzzles for the students um one other thing that I wanted to mention about the teacher dashboard is that we have a solutions link that people have been asking about it's been broken for a while but it should be fixed pretty soon so when you're in your teacher account when you look at a puzzle down here it says see the solution and I'm not sure if this one will work but it should be working soon and we have a question here um the question says how many sections can one teacher have i'm pretty sure that you can have almost an unlimited number of sections I'm there's there's not a limit that I know of so you should feel free to keep creating sections great thank you for the questions so one other thing I wanted to mention that we're about to add to the teacher dashboard is a certificate for the 20hour course currently when you end the 20hour course there's not the appropriate amount of congratulations but we're working on fixing that so soon we will have a certificate like you might have seen the certificate for the hour of code we will have a congratulations you completed your twenty our certificate and you'll be able to print that from the teacher dashboard so that should be available in the future as well um I'd like to talk a little bit about I'm going to stop my screen share here I'd like to talk a little bit about problem solving for teachers so also in the Q&A app if you want to just add suggestions to anything I'm talking about that would be great so if you're using this in your classroom you come across things that worked well kind of put your comments in the Q&A app and other people can read them and I'll comment on them as necessary um so problem solving for teachers let's see really in in a computer science classroom a teachers there to facilitate student discovery it's not always that you have to be the expert in the room it's about helping students take a step back and breaking down problems in two parts so you can help them identify where when the problem of the program like isn't working right and then you can like help them identify how to solve their problem so that's a much it takes a little pressure off the teacher being the expert in the room so it's it's taking some that pressure off you and it's it's kind of it's fostering a community of learners rather than the teacher having all the information let's see also on our on our forum so forums code org there in the eighth grade curriculum section we have an FAQ that you can have some of your frequently answered questions taken care of and we would love that forum to become a space for educators to come and discuss things with other educators so if you have something that you're struggling with in your classroom you can come and post a thread and maybe someone else will answer it with suggestions they had in their classroom there are over 10,000 teachers signed up to do this course and I think utilizing that forum would be a really powerful tool to see how other people are using it in their classrooms and get support from people who are doing it out in the field another way you could find educators locally you could ask your district to send out an email to all the teachers in the district to see if there are other people teaching this course it might even spur some people to want to try and teach the course I think it's great to have in person connections and people who are in your community that might know more about you or about your school about your students to really collaborate with on I think that's a really powerful thing so just going out and finding who's already teaching us or who might want to teach this and having them as a place to bounce ideas off of or get support from would be great we have another question says I finished all 27 badges and tried to redeem my game the code was expired what should I do um I would say you should probably post something on the forum or email help at code.org if that's an issue that might be an issue with the code the game code um yeah and another question me says are you trying to put this in all schools that's not our goal we would love to see computer science in more schools and it's fine if schools want to use our course but there are there are plenty of other great courses out there so we have more offerings on our website from thirdparty resources so if you go to code org slash learn / beyond there are also other computer science offerings that would be great choices for schools great and we have an another question that says what do i do if my all my students finish the course but I don't get my prize from donors cheese so we do have classroom rewards currently that the first 1,000 teachers who successfully need the 15 students through this course will get a thousand dollars and donor choose gift cards so the way it works is that 15 of your students have to receive all 27 concept trophies and then you'll be emailed a code that you can redeem at DonorsChoose and the question said what do you do if all your students finish the course but you don't get your prize that's that's a tough one because the cases are so specialized I would be sure that all of your students have successfully gotten all 27 trophies you can check that for your progress dashboard making sure they have gold trophies next to all of their names and if you're looking for the extra two hundred and fifty dollar bonus for having seven of those students be female me users have to have selected female when they sign up or before they complete the 27 concept trophies so you have to make sure that their account says that they're female to receive that extra two hundred fifty dollars great we have another question that says if students forget their username how can I help them log in that is a good question if you go to your progress dashboard I'm just going to look at mine quickly here if you go to your progress dashboard and same manage students you can click on the student's name and then if you scroll all the way down to the bottom it says there's some different fields at the bottom and one of them says username so that's how you would find out their username another question great this question says do you have any plans to include any video clips for teachers showing them a peek inside a classroom where one of the coding lessons is going on this might be a good way to show teachers they do not have to be the expert that is a great idea we have definitely thought about that in the past and we could definitely implement that going forward I think it's a great resource for especially new teachers who are new to computer science to be able to see that see see it happening in the classroom and see how it really unfolds ouch out in the field that's great to know that other educators are looking for that as well so we will we will try and include that in future offerings I will make think about that right now great so there are just a couple other things I wanted to mention about support for using the 20hour course or using any new computer science education materials it's possible that some of your students parents might work in software or might have knowledge about computer science it's possible to ask them for help on the technical side of questions while you provide the educational side of computer science education because someone might have technical expertise in the area but you as the classroom teacher and use the educator know what's right for your classroom and what works well and why so I would definitely take whatever advice a you might get from a professional software expert or someone who has background in the field I would definitely take that and adapt it to your classrooms needs great we have another question that says I notice that your website has arabic language do the PDF files translate to Arabic as well currently they do not so we might include that in the future it's something we'd like to do because we would love for students who no other languages to be able to use it as well currently we don't but that is something we might do in the future we have another question it says is there a reason my teachers and need to be public school teachers in order to receive the awards I'm a private school teacher just inquiring thanks so the way we do our educator processes is through donorschoose and they require that teachers the US public school teachers so that's just kind of the way that we've decided to do our teacher prizes and also co dot orgs mission as a nonprofit is to help bring science computer science education to K through 12 US public schools so that as the mission of our nonprofit is what we decided to give rewards for but obviously we're still giving our curriculum and our advice and lots of our other materials for free for everybody so we hope that everybody uses them but we can only give rewards to so many people great and Roxanne would like to absurd to add a little more detail and from working with donors shoes I know the reason why they only work with public schools is because the process to bear by a school is much easier you know I think they would love to have the infrastructure to work with all schools but the reason that we have decided to work with them is you know when anyone's doing this curriculum we want to verify that they are indeed a teacher at a school in the u.s. to give them a prize not like a fraudulent account or someone else so um that's what we're doing now but we definitely more prizes to come cool Thank You Robin and we have another question great i love all these questions coming in this one says can you give a working definition of computer science i am a media teacher awesome that you're teaching consider yeah thank you for thanks for being interested in computer science a great start so in the PDF for the first unplugged lesson there is a definition of computer science the interesting thing about the field of computer science is that there is no there's not a definition that is widely accepted as the definition of computer science so the one that we provide in our unplugged activity that introduces computer science to students the definition says the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase problemsolving power so that's that's a small definition you could probably ask 10 different computer scientists and get 10 different answers so I know that's um a tough answer but I hope that helps your bottom oh great we have another question that says will you do other stuff besides games um I'm not exactly sure what's meant by games so I'm assuming you mean the the blockley puzzles so we will be offering other environments in the future so there there will be other things we do we do like to present things in a fun and engaging manner so I'm not sure if that's what you mean by games but we will have different offerings in the future some of them will be more geared towards math and science and what you might think of more as in a traditional classroom but they'll still be fun and engaging so yep great keep the questions coming if you'd like um I will just continue a little more with if people are looking for more support while they're teaching their 20 outward course so we talked to earlier about kind of creating a community of learners in that the teacher doesn't have to be the expert in the room in this scenario and it's interesting because here at the code org office we have a lot of different kind of computer programmers working for us and two with varying experience some of them have years of experience that big companies years of experience with successful startups and some programmers are straight out of college and it's interesting because there are there are days that the seasoned computer programmer with 20 years of experience will ask advice from the programmer who's just gotten out of college it's there's there's so many things to know in the field of computer science you can't know them all so it's it's really great if you start off with the attitude of saying it's okay that I don't know everything and I'm I'm okay with saying i don't know let's figure it out together so also let's see what else can we talk about um strategies that might help your students work through tough spots so some teachers like to use the rule not for kind of rule of thumb that says ask three and then me which means if a student is struggling with it a problem they'll ask three of their neighbors before they'll ask the classroom teacher so this fosters a lot of students working together and it also reduces the stress of students asking you for the the first question every single time because students are bound to have similar questions so once one student figures it out they can share with their neighbor and work collaboratively in that way let's see do we have any more questions to look at yes rayos we also have a question that says for the unplugged computational thinking lessons do students need the copies of the monster catalog that have a line on this line sheets should they be on overhead transparency sheets so let me just pull up that lesson just to make sure that we're all looking at the same thing so I have my computational thinking PDF open here and it says do students need the copies of the monster catalog so so for this activity I think this is good for this activity if you're working with groups of students I would each i would give each group of student a catalog and you they can be printed on transparencies or you can have them put tracing paper over each of the monster features so they can pick and choose which monster feature they want because printing on transparency isn't that easy so you can have them put in on tracing paper but yes i would give each student or each group of students a monster catalog definitely we have another question that says says so this course is about how to teach computer science it's not about how to use a computer yes so this is about teaching computer science rather than using a computer or a technology course so a technology course or using a computer might be a course about using how to you know use PowerPoint or word or how to search things on the internet but computer science is how do you create a program like PowerPoint it's it's really becoming a creator of technology than just a user of technology let's see we also have another question that says are you working with Kahn Academy so we're not specifically working with them but they do have some great resources on computer science education so I believe they are listed in our if you go to co.org / learn / beyond I believe they are listed in our set of materials that other people are using to teach computer science we definitely they're doing some very cool stuff out there we have another question that says I have four sections of classes if one section completes it before the others will that qualify for the donors choose award or do all students have to complete it so no just as soon as 15 of your students finish the course that's fine it's not it's not a percentage of how many students you have signed up it's just 15 total let's see we have another question that says what can we do after we finish the 20hour course to keep teaching that is a great question i would head over to the section i keep talking about its code org slash learn / beyond so that has other computer science materials if your kids are really excited about to learning computer science also in hopefully by the fall of this year we will have some more offerings in the K through 8 space so you can look forward to using those materials in your classroom as well great we have a comment that says I have to say my afterschool Club of computer science easing your materials is a huge hit among my 5th graders they leave saying that was fun but it's really nice to hear I'm really glad that your students are enjoying them that's definitely what we set out to do is we set out to not only teach computer science but to show that it's fun computer science is a really fun and creative thing and it's a really empowering feeling to say I'm gonna tell this computer what to do that's that's not something that all students have a chance to do and I think that's so cool that you're teaching it with your students and you're enjoying it so thank you great we have another question that says if the ideal outcome is that students come up with solution to real problems what is the stimulus for them thinking about those problems hmm that is a good question um this is interesting because our currently are k through 8 intro to computer science course really focuses on some of the technical pieces of computer science in some of our future offerings we're going to make sure that there's there's more application to realworld problems so that students will be identifying realworld problems and thinking about how to use computer science to solve those so you kind of have to have a base knowledge of computer science and then figure out how can I use this set of tools to help me solve these realworld problems because once you have that base set of tools you'll start thinking of of things in your everyday life and and things kind of in bigger picture that you can use computer science to solve and what I would like to add too great just a few ideas for introducing students before you even start the curriculum that Katie's been explaining if you haven't already show them the videos we have on our website we found that it both or all of them are really effective in just getting students interested in computer science and our video titles what most schools don't teach just shows people with amazing careers doing amazing things with computer science and also for girls especially a lot of them don't um might think it's just for boys or might be turned off but think about maybe inviting a college student a few years older than your students to your class who's studying computer science or you know students from clubs who are doing other things and they can talk about what they're doing with it or show them role model is either like a video or interview or an article or a poster um there's a website called diva for ideas for girls that shows basically any industry whether it's like fashion business science medicine how you can use technology and computer science to be in those fields and I think all those things are really effective in getting students to think about how this relates to the real life and then once they're learning the tools will be like this is cool I can do something with it that's the most rewarding thing yeah great hey it's another comment this looks like a comment that says the problem in computer education where I live is it's only for how to use the computer I think that's a reality that lot a lot of people are facing and it's it's definitely nice to see educators come out and and are looking to teach computer science versus just how to use the computer and and we do see a lot of clubs that have more girls and boys and that's awesome that's that's very cool that you have so many girls interested that's awesome that is we're definitely looking to help the ratio of male to female computer scientists get back to a little more normal we also have a question says can classes sections you split out on the teachers screen edit student function I need to change my students passwords but I can't do it by course as it's an alpha list also can't see their password to give it to them but have to change it when forgotten um let's see so can classes be split out on the teachers screen um I guess I'm not understanding the question enough do you do you have any insight I just want to make sure i'm answering the right questions so i guess there's an edit student section let me let me go to the screen and pull it up yes so if you have multiple classes can you edit them by class so when I feel free to add some more yeah its own below if you can help us out yeah I just want to make sure I'm answering your question correctly so if I so like can you sort by section if I wanted to put a bunch of students in a new section I could highlight all their names and then we're not highlight but I could click the empty box next to their name so the check mark appears and I could say a sign check students to section and then there's a drop down menu and I could pick which which section I wanted them to put into and once again you can only change students password if they signed up using that section code through co.org /join so if they signed up using an email they have to reset them the passwords themselves so that's that's the only thing cool and if I didn't answer your question well enough please feel free to ask it again in a different way great yeah and if well we'll stay on just a little longer just in case anyone has any questions there's some time a little less sometimes a low lag between the broadcast and people asking questions but I really hope that people have gotten a lot out of these info sessions and I hope that people convert will use the forums to connect with other educators about further questions they might have or advice they'd like to get from other educators or suggestions on how we could make it better so if you like to connect with other educators you can head over to forums code org and click on the K through 8 curriculum and if you if you start a thread there hopefully other educators will come along and and really make it a vibrant community of people who are using this on the field because people are and people are enjoying it and people students are enjoying it so I would love for people to connect and have a really great experience doing that so I think we will end a little early today if anyone would like to continue asking questions please have a head over to forums code org and we really appreciate you coming to show up and I really appreciate Roxanne and mom for being here today this is great so thanks again and um happy teaching computer science
