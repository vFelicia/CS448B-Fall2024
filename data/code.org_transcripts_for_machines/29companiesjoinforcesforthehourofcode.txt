well staying with tech coding is the new literacy two dozen tech companies are working to make sure more people are equipped Microsoft Google others partnering with code.org it teaches computer science students worldwide and increasing diversity in the programming field Jeff Elder is with me now from The Wall Street Journal so Jeff why what's in it for these big tech companies well diversity has been one of the big issues this year dearra and it's a systemic problem it begins with education and tech companies have said we have to start walking the walk so this is a way for them to band together some of these companies are competitors so it can be difficult for them to work together on something that has to do with their personnel so this is a way for them to commit to take part so at what point Jeff are they getting in the mix I mean are they going with high school students what ages are we talking about well uh code.org aims to get computer science part of a Core Curriculum throughout education the tech company's two dozen big CEOs sent out emails today to all of their employees asking them to participate in this December program to help raise money for schools so they can get this curriculum and to take part in these online tutorials themselves so is it taking off I mean it's one thing for two dozen companies to say to a few exacts okay listen you really should go do this but are you seeing a reaction I mean you're out there in Silicon Valley is there a commitment I do I think it begins with raising awareness deardra and I think people are realizing that computer science is science computer science is math that this can take the place of some core curricula that have been there in the past and be a verifiable part of Education and Training preparation for the workforce Jeff makes sense thank you very much Jeff Elder joining us there from The Wall Street Journal
