for our new high school course where we teach computer science principles code.org has built a new tool called applab it's a webbased programming tool that lets you build mobile apps super quickly and share it to your friends on their phones applab has two main parts design mode where I can build the layout of my app and code mode where I can power the my app with code either in blocks or JavaScript text so I'm going to dive in and show you the different features of applab and what you can do with it so here I've landed in code mode but I'm actually going to switch over to design mode quickly the app I'm going to build is an app that lets you pick your favorite pop star whether it's Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift so in design mode I don't need to know HTML or css and I can get going with my layout I can also choose and upload my custom images and assets so I've designed this background here that I can add to my app and choose that and then I can easily drag and drop uh design elements into my app so this is going to be my drop down where you can pick whether you like Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift better and then I'm also going to have an image here where I show their face depending on what you've picked so again I can just easily upload some new images so I'll start with Lady Gaga because that's what's Chosen and that's the basics of my app so now I'm going to go over to code mode to power it what you're seeing here over in code mode is I've got these blocks arranged in different categories and like a typical blockbased programming environment I can just drag these on so this is the on event block so when drop down one is changed I want to change the face so I can drag and drop this if else in what's super neat is that I can transition over to text if it's easier to type so now if the text of drop down one is Lady Gaga then I want to change the images super neat thing is that I can actually drag these blocks straight into text mode here so depending on what the user picks I want to change the image and I can seamlessly just transition back into code mode and say that I want image one to be Lady Gaga if she's Chosen and I want image one to be Taylor otherwise I don't have my Taylor picture yet so I can just add this quickly and choose her and that's my basic app and let's make sure it runs so I pick Taylor Swift she shows up Lady Gaga perfect so I could share this app right now and I would do that by clicking share up here and I could text my friend the link but I can make this app even more interesting applab has built a lightweight persistent data service so that if I want to store data for my app I can so let's make this a bit more interesting and say that I actually want to send out this app to all my friends and make it a survey where they get to vote whether they like Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift better and then I'm going to analyze the results so to do that I'm going to go back to design mode and I'm going to add a submit button so that after you've made your choice you can submit it and because I'm building a mobile app I can easily add new screens so I'm just going to make a very basic uh thanks for voting screen so just going to change the background add some text here change some of the properties super easily just make this a bit bigger and and there okay so now I want to make sure that I actually write to the database when the person hits submit so similar to what I did for the dropdown I'm going to use the on event block and when button one which is my submit button is clicked I'm going to write to the database so here's the data category and I'm going to use the create record block I'm going to make a new table called see pop stars and I'm going to the name of the column is going to be name and then what do I want to actually send that same get text from the dropdown so that'll either be Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift so I can just say get the text from dropdown one and save it to the database in this format I want the column name to be name and that's it so and then when the record is done being created I want to switch to my thank you for your vote screen so I can come down here in my UI controls and set the screen to screen two so let's check this out so go ahead and run I'll pick Taylor Swift and hit submit so I got the thanks for my vote but I can't see yet whether uh whether that actually stored successfully or not but luckily I can take a peek at what is going on in the database so I'm opening up my data here here's my table pop stars and I can view that and I can see that I've got one row for the Taylor Swift uh the Taylor Swift entry that I made I could go back and run my app again and instead submit Lady Gaga and I can go back to my data refresh that and there's my second entry so you can see how all these will accumulate in the same place and I can do any kind of analysis on that data that I want so I've shown you around the different features of applab uh we're really excited about it and it's getting incorporated into our computer science principles class and we hope you enjoy thanks
