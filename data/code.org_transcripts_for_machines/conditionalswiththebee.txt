This is the conditional block. It says IF there is nectar or honey that is equal, less than or greater than a number, then DO something. This is useful when we don't know how much nectar or honey to get, as we see here with this question mark. In this example, we're going to say IF the purple flower has nectar greater than 0, get nectar. That will tell our bee to keep getting nectar as long as it's there. Tadah!
