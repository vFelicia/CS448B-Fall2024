sometimes we want to know if multiple reference variables are pointing to the same thing my sibling and i share a pair of shoes when i'm wearing them they're my shoes when my sibling is wearing them and their shoes were both referring to the same pair of shoes my shoes and their shoes are two aliases for one object an alias is when two reference variables point to the same object let's say we have a su class it has an instant variable for size let's create a shoe object called first shoe and another shoe object called second issue both are solid 10. when we use the equals operator with these two objects it checks if the first two and secondary variables point to the same memory location in this case the expression returns false because first sue and second issue are two different objects since these are objects we can try comparing them using a method remember the string method the object class also has something called the equals method the equals method can be used to compare two objects for equality the equals method in the object class returns true if two reference variables are aliases let's compare first two and seconds we'll call the equals method on first suit then we pass the objects we want to compare to as the argument in this case we will pass the second shift when we compare first suit and second suit using the equals method it will return false first sioux and second two are not aliases because they do not point to the same objects if we give first sue an alias called thirdsu then we can use the equals method to compare the two it will return true because they are two differently for a single object anything is helpful for when we want to know if multiple reference variables point to the same object however this is not helpful for when we want to know if one object's theta is the same as another's but just like the two string method we can override the equals method you
