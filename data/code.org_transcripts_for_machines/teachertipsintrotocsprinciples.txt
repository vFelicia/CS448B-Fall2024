what i love about the computer science principles curriculum and activities is that the course is really just a touch upon course it touches upon it coding ai how the internet works computer science theory like binary numbers and number systems data analysis big data all of these things together make up computer science one of the best things about teaching computer science is seeing their creative side seeing students creative side seeing their passions their interests come to life through their apps and and i've seen in recent years code.org changed their curriculum to give students more of an opportunity to be unique and to showcase um what they are passionate about when they're making their apps and encouraging to make things that will change the world and i like how code.org has laid out the brainstorming the planning process when we're designing an app where they get feedback from others and they focus on what is the purpose of the app what do we want it to do when i think about students going off and getting a job they're all inevitably going to use a computer no matter what field they go into and being able to see the computer is something more than just this magic black box that hopefully does what you want it to but having some control over it some understanding it's going to take them very far and it's going to save them some frustration at the very least code.org focuses greatly on building a classroom culture that is welcoming code.org wants your classroom to be a classroom where students feel comfortable students from all different levels whether they are students with special needs to students who are high achieving students of different ethnicities and genders all students can be welcomed into a computer science classroom and can learn computer science and having something like ap computer science principles as an option and something that has the ap name behind it that can really encourage them and their families to get them to sign up for that is something that i think is really powerful you
