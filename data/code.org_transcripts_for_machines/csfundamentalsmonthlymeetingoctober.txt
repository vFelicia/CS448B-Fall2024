can y'all hear me there on the line i think i've muted everyone actually let's see i'll unmute you can use that a thumbs up you can hear me yeah yeah i'll get you thank you so welcome everybody my name is melissa jones and i'm a community manager here at code.org i'm excited to welcome you to our october monthly meeting for the cs fundamentals curriculum which is our k5 curriculum courses one through four um tonight laura klein unfortunately couldn't join us she had a conflicting meeting but i'm very excited to um share her updates with you um we're also joined by kiki protzman our program manager for cs fundamentals and our special guest maria litvin who is a high school teacher and a k5 affiliate in massachusetts maria has some really exciting and challenging um problems to share with us i think you guys will all be interested in so our goals tonight um first and foremost as usual the goal of these calls is to connect as a community and to help give you information and an opportunity to um foreign bond and to meet other teachers who are teaching the same curriculum as you tonight we're going to explore some opportunities to challenge your k5 students um that maria is going to be sharing with us and then later kiki is going to be discussing strategies for modifying the cs fundamentals curriculum to meet your student needs whether your students are advanced if your students are struggling she's going to help you figure out how to do that we'll have some time at the end for questions concerns and feedback for the group and some exciting announcements about our code so just to get started if this is your first time using blue jeans please be aware that we can um you can see us and you can hear us but we can't see you unless you have your microphone and your um webcam on um so sit back relax enjoy the show if you do have something that you'd like to add there's a chat window right above you that you can go ahead and click on and that's a great place to introduce yourself to put a question for the presenter feedback share a link anything that you'd like to share the chat has a great place to do that then later when we have discussion time you can activate your microphone on your webcam by clicking just below your picture and then we will be able to hear you and see you and when we get to that point of the agenda i will explain more about how to do that before we dive into tonight's agenda i just wanted to call your attention to the fact that code.org recently real uh released rather the results of our 20142015 program evaluation um so for the past year actually longer than a year since the beginning of code.org we've been studying our impact and studying the results of our programs and over the last year 2014 to 2015 we actually saw a huge number of students and teachers that we reached through our efforts with a high degree of satisfaction and some really interesting findings around effectiveness cost per teacher cost per student and scale and reach so i really encourage you if you haven't had a chance to take a look to go to code.org about flash evaluation and take a look at our results and then give us feedback um where are we doing well where can we improve we really value the community and we value your input and then also just to say thank you to all of you who are out there teaching cs fundamentals every day who are using courses one through four leading unplugged lessons stretching yourself outside of your comfort zone we really appreciate the teachers that are using our curriculum and giving us feedback and helping us to make it better what i'm going to do now is introduce you to a phenomenal teacher that we're very excited to have tonight maria lippman maria is a code.org k5 affiliate from andover massachusetts and she's also a high school teacher maria is going to share with you some really interesting ideas for how you can stretch your computer science curriculum in your grades three through five curriculum so marie i'll hand it over to you thank you melissa hi everybody uh i'm maria again as melissa said i teach math and computer science in high school it's phillips academy and dover massachusetts and as a kodoturg affiliate and also a grandma of a couple of kids who are grandkids a sixyearold and nineyearold my husband and i started writing uh computer contest questions for the little kids and the continental math mathematics league is organization that uh has a contest in mathematics and other subjects for over 35 years and they heard all the um information coming from everywhere with code.org and heidi uh explaining and promoting computer science and they asked my husband and me to write the contest for the young kids for computer science um and so that's what we're doing and i wanted to share with you these contest questions uh and uh so you will see and then you will see them they're also available for you to use with your elementary school kids let's go to the next slide so the contest itself is uh consists of three meets one in january one in february one in march each it has six questions for 30 minutes and it's completely unplugged students don't need a computer to do their problems uh and what is interesting that we tried it with students who are have no programming experience and they're able to do it uh but of course students who've done some puzzles or code.work puzzles from studio.org they are doing uh better because they uh already seen different kinds of puzzles and uh they can see patterns better so the teachers receive these questions and answers and solutions are in advance and administered contests close to the specified time one in january one in february and one in march let's take a look at the next slide and the teacher grades the work because they have all the answers and they send the top six answers to uh cml uh and then cml determines uh the best uh the winners for individual meets and also for the whole contest what is interesting is that uh a teacher like you can have all students in grades three to five to participate and have these interesting questions and then uh just take six of these scores that are the best and send those scores and you can mix the a team could be consists of third fourth and fifth graders together but if you have a separate teams one for third graders one for fourth graders one for fifth graders then the third graders don't need to solve as many puzzles and to to consider it you know because they'll be graded against other third graders and they will do better and uh cml sends medals and they have send certificates and it's always very lovely at the end kids are many kids are rewarded for the experience but uh yeah and then uh the the best teams uh have regional and recognition of national recognition yeah let's take a look at the next slide so this question is written in python programming language and even though students don't know the language but when they read it the description then they can figure it out it basically says that take a number from the user and then uh if that number greater than five then print the number that's less than five less than it and otherwise print one and so it's the explanation is given and kids with a can figure that one out that's one example let's take a look at the next the next slide so this one's uh this slider look as you see if you did uh some kudo torque puzzles especially graph paper programming you see or some online puzzles amaze these are kind of similar this one has a it's called pink painter and she's a programmer robot and she moves up down left right and she can paint and so kit as you see in a program that is written there are a couple of question marks and so students starting at the start position have to figure out if they go up and then to the right then they paint and then at some point you see their question marks and they need to figure out what operation goes there what command goes there so it is accessible of course for them take a look at another kind of problem the next one so these problems are interesting um as you see right now it's kind of clear that all cards on the left of the divider have some feature that cards on to the right of the divider don't have and then on the bottom we have five pictures and kids need to figure out which ones of which three out of those on the bottom belong on the left side now you might think that that it's very straightforward because all the left uh pictures have a darkened triangle and the ones on the right don't have it but actually these slides were not reproduced exactly uh and when you go to the the the slides that from pdf file you would see there were also like circles and they were there were more on this picture so it was harder to pick up the pattern but even this one is very nice for the beginner kids to figure out what's going on yep let's take a look at the next slide so um these 18 contest questions there's six in each meets six times three is eighteen are for last year are located as you see where they are at skyler.com uh and uh you can it's they're good to use with kids who for example finish some of your puzzles you don't want them to move ahead in a different stage because you want to do an unplugged lesson so you can give them these enrichment problems and have them solve those uh and and then together go with the rest of the kids to the next uh stage or next unplugged activity with you and here's a link to register for the upcoming year uh and uh yeah so there are two two places to register either directly skylea.com or uh at the dml continental math league yep and for the next puzzle you see i wanted to mention for the next slide we see that born with problems the one with the patterns on the left and on the right this is really the whole series of questions with all kids like and they are of increasing difficulty uh mikhail wangardt was a russian computer scientist and one of the pioneers of ai and machine learning and he was trying to get computer to recognize the patterns and so he started with many of these puzzles and then they were so popular that many other people started writing their own puzzles and people keep adding new puzzles and on the next slide you will see that let's take a look this is uh the first slide that is the first blunder problem and i tried it with my granddaughter who was four and she figured it out pretty quickly and of course we have our students in kindergarten and then the second puzzle was harder and third puzzle harder but they start very nicely very simply and yeah now let's take a look at the next slide in the next slide it says that there's an index of these problems there are almost 300 problems and they will compiled and one after another and you can solve them on a computer and also on an ipad and you can very nicely slide from one to the next the kid with the kids and also you can design your own uh blonder problems as well and with gary and i design one for this year for the upcoming year out of three contests one of them will again have a blunder problem uh yes i think that's pretty much it let's just see i think that's uh just the last thing that's my email if you'd like to email me and uh to answer any questions about either one good problems or about the continental matly contest so if you have questions yeah thank you thank you so much maria it's wonderful to see these ideas for how to push our students um further beyond these fundamentals if you have questions for maria please do put them in the chat pod maria do you know how to um look and see if there are questions there for you um and then after you're watching this video later on and i have questions from maria i'm sure she'd love to hear from you but then pd.co.org next i'm going to hand it over to kiki who's going to continue talking a little bit about how you can differentiate the cs fundamentals curriculum for your students kiki yeah differentiation is a big deal in the classroom and especially in computer science because we get to this place where we uh expect to be in lockstep with curriculum like every kid should be at every place at the same time but when you're doing computer science especially when you're doing computer science online the selfguided tutorial nature allows you to let go of that a little bit so we could go to the next slide and it might be there it just isn't refreshing for me there we go so there are some things that you can do when you're using cs fundamentals to give each of the children in your class a really uh good experience and one of those things is not to hold them back a puzzle at a time so even just allowing a few puzzles worth of flexibility is good uh like if you're walking down the street with a youngster you might be able to say okay you can run ahead but you got to stop at the street stop the street and wait for us to get back to you that's a good technique to use for some of your class if you have kids that want to run ahead let them to a certain extent and then say when you get to this puzzle i want you to start walking around the classroom and seeing if anyone needs help or i want you to start being an advisor in some way so that you can help the other kids that haven't got it yet similarly there will be kids that are further back than the other students and what you have to do as a teacher is figure out how far back you're comfortable letting them be before you send someone over to help them now i'm not necessarily talking about going over and helping them yourself because a student gets more out of figuring out another problem with another student than they do having the teacher go over and solve it for them so you can you can start to get this gap in puzzles that's going to widen and shorten depending on how difficult things are also if you look here uh you actually can't see my screen because you're looking at the slides but if you look at the image at the top you'll see that for every concept we have multiple stages so we have the unplugged lesson that's getting loopy and then we have three following stages of loops now it is possible that you're going to go through all three stages of loops with your class but if you have a student that's really struggling rather than pull the rug out from under them and say okay well you didn't finish this this one let's move on to the next one it's possible to let those struggling students continue with may's loops until you're confident that they get it even if the rest of the class has moved on to artist loops and as a teacher if you don't have time to do all those stages of loops then you can just pick a couple and do those really well versus trying to rush through all of them now you might notice that at the end there are a few levels that are circled in blue and those are assessment levels so even if you only get halfway through the rest of the puzzles you can then skip over to the assessment levels and make sure that the students are getting it some kids may not finish a stage and that's fine there are several puzzles at the end of every stage that are meant to just stretch them and challenge their abilities so if they only get towards get past the stuff that they need to get through to understand the concept that's perfectly okay and then another option is to have some preapproved things for students to do if they get to the end so if your students have gone all the way through the stage you've got five students who are done and there's 20 minutes of class left and you need to figure out something to do with them they've already gone around and walked and tried to help their their friends another thing that you can do is have links that you know ahead of time it's okay for them to go to and whether that is a play lab link so something still within cs fundamentals where they can spread their wings and try some creativity and mess with things that they might not know yet but they'll be able to learn by doing that's perfectly cool or send them over to code.org learn which is where a bunch of the big hits from the hour of code end up so the programs that have had huge success in roping kids in as far as entertainment level we'll put those over in code.org learn and the kids can go through and play with some other types of puzzles and by doing that you allow this flexibility and this uh engagement where the struggling kids don't feel like oh i'm holding everybody up and they're gonna just fast forward me because i can't get it and everybody needs to move along so we get rid of that frustration and then on the other side we get rid of the frustration of oh man i'm already done i'm so bored what do i do and so now you can keep your whole class happy instead of just teaching to that middle third with that in mind um talking about some special puzzles i'm going to go ahead and go to the next slide and give you all a preview of something so this is something that we just decided to put out just for you who are watching this we're not going to be advertising it widely because it's not something that's going to stick around it's not going to become part of our curriculum it's just something special for you for taking your time to to come here and watch the webinar so uh right this is a screenshot of one of our halloween puzzles and uh it's not quite live yet it's still being tested it'll be released tomorrow or the day after and you'll be able to find it at studio.co.org s special series and there are three puzzles in this series and i'm going to quickly take you through them so let me share my screen and let's see if it will let me share firefox here so i'm going to assume you can see this and i'm going to proceed forward as if you can see this uh so here is the special level that i had the screen shot of this is actually the second level and oh i see a chat message so i just want to make sure oh but if i switch over there you'll be able to see that too okay so if so if there is a problem please send me your microphone and go ahead and tell me but you're great we can see you everything's awesome okay thank you so here we go we've got this and this is just asking you to fill up the sky with stars and here we've actually done the majority of the coding for you there's just a few random integer blocks to drop around now you'll notice we don't go through and tell you what all of these are we don't say hey here's how you use this block this is all meant to be selfexploration and it's all meant to be just a good time to play and and doodle around here so we have stars let's put between five and seven points on our star let's make them between 50 and 75 pixels long and then we'll jump forward between oh you know what that might be big let's put that in here how far we jump between each star and then the length of our star and you'll see that it says to repeat this zero times which isn't going to make a very interesting drawing so we can start by repeating it three times and see what happens and we can run that and we get a nice little it's kind of almost drawing a star within a star but it doesn't really do very much so then what happens if we do thanks and then your kids can share these and put them in their their gallery just the same as they can with any other artist drawing so now i'm going to move through and i'm going to do 20 times repeat and it takes a little while to draw stars so i probably won't let it keep going but you'll see that you get a much more interesting drawing by doing this more times and the kids can play with anything they can mess with any of the parameter numbers and it's all free play so there's not going to be a right answer and a wrong answer they can just play with it and whatever they end up with they end up with the first one is a ghost so we have just a very nice simple warm up here and you'll notice we give no starting code so they have to figure out how to make the eyes of the ghost and we give them all of the functions that they need to do that and more so if they wanted to do eyes on the ghost and then give it a pinwheel mouth they're more than welcome to do that and then we end up with an artist level and this just says program the artist to design a face for your jackolantern so you can go through and draw a jackolantern any way you want and then just save it to your gallery share it with your friends let your friends remix it and do more things with it and it's just kind of a fun a way to get your students reenergized as far as artist goes so now i'm gonna try and pop back over here and stop sharing my screen and there we go sorry took me a minute to get myself off view there because i was switching screens around but kiki's super cool so much fun i know that a lot of folks were excited in the chat pod when they saw these levels um again they're not live right now but they will be live tomorrow or the next day and if you follow a teach code on twitter we'll announce when it's live or you can check out our blog the url is uh behind me but it's teacherblog.cod.org um and if you like these let us know um tell us on twitter tell us on the teacher blog you know we have lots of creative ideas and if you use things like this in your classroom we'd love to hear it um great so thanks a lot kiki and any questions or comments or feedback for kiki please feel free to leave in the chat pod i'm just going to move forward with some program updates from laura um and then we will have some time for discussion at the end so um on the theme of differentiation and how you can push yourself and push your students i'm just a reminder that the hour of code is coming we've had almost 50 000 educators around the world sign up this year already to host an hour of code and many of you probably have done hour of code in past years or signed up for this year and this is just a really exciting way to build awareness in your community about computer science get kids excited get teachers and parents and community members excited so really um you know eager to see what you all come up with this year and how you plan your hours of code this year i'm going to just talk you through a couple details that are specific to this year and if you have questions about our code you can definitely ask us on twitter or you can go to hourofco.com and we can answer them there so we've just announced this week that every educator who signs up to host an hour of code is going to receive a 10 gift card to amazon.com itunes or the windows store as a thank you gift so all you have to do is go to hourofcode.com sign up say you're going to host an hour of code and you'll get a 10 thank you gift i hope that everybody has a chance to do that keep in mind also out of everyone that signs up and every organizer that says they're going to host an event one school in each u.s state including washington d.c will win 10 000 worth of technology for their school so these prizes are you know icing on the cake the hour of code is fun enough on its own but it's also nice to know that there's this incentive there um also i'm really excited this year to share with you guys we've been working really hard to develop some new teacher resources we know that there are a lot of folks who've done the hour of code now for two or three years and they're ready to step up their game and take it to another level and we wanted to make that easier for you this year so we've updated our hour of code teacher page with six easy steps to get started so if you or someone in your building has never done it before and you want to make it easy for them the howto guide should be much clearer now we also have a template lesson plan that you can use to create your own hour of code lesson plan and we're actually collecting those this year so if you develop a lesson plan that works in the english class or geography class for hour of code share those and we'd love to be able to share them with their network we have a really cool slide deck that has some best practices from past hour of code teachers you can find that on the teacher resources page um and we're hosting two webinars coming up one in november and one in december a similar format to this kind of a webinar but we'll be presenting the first one's called educator's guide to the hour of code and that will explain how you can get up and running with the hour of code and give you some ideas for what you can do in your classroom um so we'd love to see you on that one the the webinar that we're doing in december is called sneak peek 2015 tutorials and that's when we'll be talking to you about our new and exciting tutorials that we're developing for this year those are going to be available on november 11th so that's them in my hour of code announcements and i wanted to just open it up for questions now before you move on let me check into the chat pod if anyone has a question or comment or something that you would like to share please do put in the chat pod now or you can unmute yourself and share with the group let's see so kim asks is it too late to still register for the hour of code ten thousand dollar prize i don't believe so i think that if you are signed up as an organizer i think you're registered um but i will check it hour of code.com and i'll double check on the deadline for you as well kim i'm pretty sure it's still open for registration are there any other um questions or feedback today our theme was really around differentiation and how you keep the cs fundamentals curriculum exciting for your students so we'd love to hear any strategies you all have for that of course if you have any feedback or ideas we always love to hear it on twitter you can tweet at us at teach code um keep in mind that we're going to be having these monthly meetings on the third tuesday of every month so our next meeting will be in november 17th and um kiki and i will be here along with laura and another special guest to share with you great strategies that you can use in your k5 classroom keep in mind that all of our events are listed at code.org educate slash events and you can register for those that interest you so that you can receive a reminder and also a recording if you missed the event and then also keep in mind as i said we would love to continue this conversation about differentiation and hour of code on twitter you can tweet us at teach code you can also um take a look at our tumblr blog teacherblog.cod.org that's where we're going to publish those halloween puzzles tomorrow if you're looking for them and we also have forums.code.org which is our online professional learning community where you can post questions and get answers from other teachers in the community um so that's all we have for you today i want to thank you all so much for joining us i'm going to be posting this recording shortly for anybody who missed part of the presentation and we hope to see you all soon coming coming months if you have further questions feel free to add them to the chat pod or hit us up on twitter thank you bye everyone thanks kiki thanks mariah
