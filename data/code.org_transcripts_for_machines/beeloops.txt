So a loop is a repetition of activity. So going into a hive to inspect, I look at a frame and then I put it back, so I repeat that same activity multiple times. It's looping around, doing the same activity multiple times. In this level, we want the bee to collect three nectars from the flower. Instead of using three "get nectar" blocks, you're going to use the repeat block to get nectar three times. Hit run and see if you got it right. Nice!
