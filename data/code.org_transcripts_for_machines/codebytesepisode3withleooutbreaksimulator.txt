hi everyone and welcome to code bytes in today's session we'll visit the fictional monster town where a virus outbreak is about to happen we'll be programming and running simulations to understand how the virus spreads and what can be done to slow it down and help all the monsters get healthy again hi my name is leonardo ortiz and i'm vice president of international partnerships at code.org and this is my daughter natalia who's going to be playing as my sidekick and coprogrammer today hello i am 14 years old i am in ninth grade and during the pandemic i have been learning coding using the cs fundamentals express that's cool did you like it yeah it's a lot of fun it's perfect so today is very special because as you may know this episode is one of the many activities that we're doing to celebrate computer science education week which is happening this week and there's a lot of students and teachers all over the world doing an hour of code trying an hour of code some some of them for the very first time in their life so i know that many of you are joining us for different cities uh i would like to see where where you're from we have a map in which we'll see where you're joining us from so wow i expected a lot of different cities in the u.s which we do have we have some people in alaska we have some people from mexico i see someone in venezuela but i'm surprised to see that there are also some of you joining us from europe from africa uh even all the way from india that is amazing uh so that's very impressive and uh well we're both in seattle natalie and i are here in seattle today actually i wanted to be here at the headquarters of code.org in downtown seattle uh just to be with you uh for this episode um there's there's a little bit over one billion times that students have done hours of code uh since we started the hour of code seven years ago but before we get into today's activity i actually want to acknowledge and recognize a female pioneer in the computer science space today is her birthday and by the way it is one of the reasons why we are celebrating computer science education week around this date so we're going to put a poll to see if you know who i'm talking about so we have several options here loblis nova roy mutin grace hopper mary ellen wilkies so we see that there's a lot of people voting for one candidate in particular and then okay let's stop it there i think i think around half of the audience actually knew the answer today is the birthday of grace hopper um for those of you that don't know her i'm actually going to read something here is um admiral grace hoppers uh is her birthday today if you don't know her she was born in 1906 and was a highly respected admiral in the u.s navy and she helped developed a compiler that was a precursor to the widely used programming language called cobol we always make sure to plan computer science education week as i mentioned around her birthday so let's move on natalia today we're going to learn how to code using a tool called sprite lab we're actually going to try and do a simulation the simulation of an outbreak why because we're in the middle of a pandemic so i think it's very appropriate for us to try and and better understand how a pandemic behaves in coding allows us to explore a little bit more about how that happens and and mainly because when you simulate something a simulation allows you to better understand something that happens in the world like in this case a candidate so you can follow us by by in your computer if you just go and write code.org outbreak then you can also do the simulation at the same time as we are going to be doing it so natalia do you want to share the screen with you yeah so natalia is going to be driving she's going to be showing us her screen perfect so if you're doing this in your computers and you typed code.org outbreak this is what you will see uh and natalia why don't you tell us a little bit about what's going on here with monster town i see i see a lot of monsters there yeah mountain town's usually a happy and healthy place and they like to wander around to visit their friends but one day one of the monsters has caught a virus which is a tiny germ that can make monsters sick but the other monsters are not too worried about it they keep visiting their friends but soon more monsters keep catching the virus and so the remaining healthy monsters want to research ways to prevent other monsters from getting sick and so they found that if they wear a mask it is less likely for sick monsters to spread to other healthy monsters perfect well that's a great story and it kind of talks about what happens during a pandemic but if we actually code and we use the learnings of computer science we can actually bring this monster down to life do you want to do that yeah sure let's do it we're going to click continue so that we can get into the levels and this is what we have here in this tool in sprite level you have the workspace which is where we're going to be doing all the coding you have this middle section that says blocks where you have different blocks we're going to be pulling blocks from there to do our simulation and you have the canvas side on the left to the upper left corner where we're going to see what is it that we're creating what do you think about that color natalia do you like it no how about we do okay um something like this okay you like peach perfect so we're gonna have that um we now have that color and the instruction here is that we need to create ten healthy sprites uh in one sprite that is sick so how do you do that well let's look at the tab sprites okay we have we have these blocks that say sprites you need to drag those blocks and add so now we have 10 healthy sprites we're missing the the the sick one perfect so now we have the sprites but sprites are a little bit uh a little bit large don't you think yeah they look too squish well in order if and if you want to change that how do you do it well there's actions see what's in there okay if in those actions you actually can do certain things in our simulation in this case you need to draw drag that block that says size and look it already kind of gave you a size what if you wanted to go like very small and do like 10 10 10 oh yeah i don't think i can see that so let's let's keep it at 50 so that it can actually uh have a little bit of space there now we already have our sprites you have the right size but they're just static like they're not doing anything so you probably want them to do something where do you where would you go to do that let's see what else is in actions oh look look at this okay if you drag that block that has an action there and you put it at the end it's going to say that all sprites are now going to wander so in order to see what is it that we're coding here you need to click run so let's do it oh look they're moving they're moving and so so now they're moving but we're in the middle of an outbreak and and this is where right now we haven't coded an event which is the word of the day that's so let's let's not share the the screen let's go back here perfect so today we're going to learn about events and for those of you that joined yesterday where we coded with a dance party that activity is all about creating events for you to do things dance moves so today right now we've already created some monsters the monsters have the right size they're there but nothing is going on so we need to create an event in an event is when you actually do something you create an action in computer science when you're coding to drive a reaction that's an event you and and you can create an action by by ordering your computer to do something when you do a click in your mouse or when you type a specific uh letter in your keyboard there are many ways in which you can create events but it's basically creating an action so that then that produces a reaction so that's an event um we're gonna we actually have a poll uh so that we can explore this concept a little bit more so let's say it says which of this is an example of an event going to a birthday party singing in the school concert or tapping an icon to open an app so i see there's almost a tie there between two responses getting close but but a little bit over half of you actually uh guessed right you know the the event in this context is tapping an icon to open an app yes for the rest of you that also said going to a party is an event or singing a school concert definitely in real life in the things that we do those are events but when you're talking about computer science an event is when you make the computer do something because you are already inputting something like clicking or identifying something that will happen so let's uh let's let's do another poll let's now do an event kind of like a uh an unplugged let's do an unplugged activity let's do an event here and for that we're gonna need the help of all of you out there um what if we wanna do something uh like arm an arm wave a silly face jazz hands let's all play with this and i i kind of guess what it's going to win so let's see let's see if i'm gonna be right yeah uh most people decided that they want to do a silly phase so let's just try not to can you do a silly phase okay so that's not in itself an event an event is now gonna be when i prompt you to do a silly phase so i'm gonna invite everyone there watching us to do us their best silly face possible every time i clap okay so when i clap you do a silly phase when i clap again you do another silly phase okay let's start perfect so those were three events that we used by clapping and then uh having a reaction to my club so we're going to continue doing events but now in our simulator for that we're going to no this is this is the one we're going to share the screen once again and we're going to put continue so let's see what's going to happen now so what happens in a pandemic uh natalia where when we you wanna you wanted to remove something yeah so just put put clear uh start over again so in a pandemic what happens when let's see that in monster town a a healthy monster comes across a sick monster and they touch each other the healthy monster will be sick the healthy monster gets sick so that's going to be an event and that's what we're going to try to do here so in order for us to produce that event in our simulator then we go to this new block that appeared here and you say when a healthy monster this is what you're seeing there touches a sick monster then you select the custom of that healthy monster is going to change its costume and that's custom is the the name of how in this case the monsters look it's going to change his custom to appear as sick so let's run the simulation and see what happens there so you see that one monster that touched another one got sick now oh there's no one i know it's moving a little bit slow but slowly look wow what happened there so what did you saw there natalia in that simulation well what happened was when the healthy monster got in contact with the sick monster that caused that healthy monster to become sick and when more healthy monsters got sick it was it was harder to control and some of the cool features of running a simulation in this case with sprite lab is that every time we run it the way in which things happen are different so why don't we run it again just to see what happens now oh wow so now for starters we had more sick monsters at the beginning and then very quickly almost all of them got sick so so that's that was one of our events uh in which we saw how the virus is spreading while the monsters are touching each other now in real life during a pandemic what can you do about it is there anything that you can do about it well we could start with um wearing masks to protect ourselves so do you think that's a good idea that the monsters start using masks in our simulation yeah okay so let's generate another event now uh in which let's go to the next level in which we're going to create this other event and yeah we need to start over sometimes when you are using sprite lab and if you're using it several times it saves part of the work that you do and if that's the case then it's good to just click over there and start over like we did right now so you see that now we have these new blocks you see these two blocks that says when healthy monster is clicked so yeah you're gonna put it there so that we can see what you're doing and then what happens what do we need we need an action right yeah an event let's see exactly when no go to actions yeah okay when so the event is when we click that's the event that means that when we click the healthy monster then that produces a change in behavior which in this case is the healthy monster is going to cover the mouth with a face mask we probably should think about doing something with the with the sick monsters as well yeah put masks on them too so they don't spread exactly because we also have discovered that during a pandemic when you put a mask to the monsters that are the people in this case that are sick then you actually can prevent the virus from spreading so what natalia just did is she created two more events that are gonna be when you click on a monster whether it's healthy or unhealthy they're gonna be covered with a base mac mask so that is going to actually require for you to do things what you see here is now we have several events going on when they touch each other they're going to infect each other but when you do a click you're going to be able to prevent that from happening but by putting a mask let's try that see okay so what happened in that in that simulation well i tried to get as many healthy monsters as i can but i also wasn't able to save every single healthy monster from getting infected exactly so you were trying quickly to put masks on the healthy ones and they kind of got spared from the virus but then there was a few of them that you didn't cover and they actually got infected um do you think we could have a better strategy for this is there anything else that we should be trying what if i click the sick monsters first liking the healthy ones yeah let's see let's see what happens if you do that now just put cover a few of the others just in case but let's see let's see what happens well it's not really doing anything to the healthy monsters because the sick monster is wearing masks therefore exactly so that was actually a good strategy in your simulation you discovered that if you target the sick monsters first and you put a mask then you can actually prevent from everyone else to to to get infected you still put a mask in a few others just for for safety but but that's actually a good strategy and and in real life we see that as well you know that's some of the things that we're doing right now uh in the united states and around the world many of us are wearing masks and it's even extra important to wear a mask when you are actually have symptoms in when you are sick so so that's a great way for you to continue doing a simulation natalia what are the what other things we didn't we didn't consider or we haven't done in our simulation well there wasn't the variable of how much time the infected monsters would remain infected well that's a good point because when you're sick you don't stay sick forever right so you may be sick for a few days or for a few weeks so in your simulation you could decide if you want to make the monster sick for an ex a specific amount of time and then they get healthy again what else well could you do in a simulation well we didn't put in the vaccine you could create a vaccine and you could vaccinate some of the monsters and that would be an even stronger way to keep them protected in addition to the mask those are things that a simulation allows you to do so let's let's not stop sharing the screen and and that those are the types of things that all of you can actually do with with sprite lab so the simulation is about trying to figure out uh how to emulate reality in the best way possible and then trying and trying it again so that you can see the different ways in which in which things can happen and as you already saw in our simulation the way that the monsters move and everything are not always in the same way so we talked about vaccines we talk about time i think those are things that you can continue doing uh in sprite life with this outbreak activity we have a few polls uh that are gonna help us also just double check a couple of the concepts that we talked about here today one of them is event so i think we have a poll there or don't we there it is but which of these might be controlled by events so let's say playing the same game three times in a row when someone gets tagged that player becomes it or a baseball team practicing before a tournament wow now the overwhelming majority of you actually selected the right uh answer which is when someone gets tagged then that someone in that game becomes it that is a very clear example of an event we have a second uh poll just to talk about about simulations which is basically what we did here today with sprite lab so how can simulations be helpful in the real world we have three very interesting answers here simulations can help us understand the world around us simulations let us let you test out ideas quickly cheaply and safely and simulations are a way to model complex systems in an interactive way so you know this is a trick question because the the reality is that all three answers are correct almost half of you actually chose answer number one as a correct answer but all of you actually showed the correct answer as well simulations allow us to do all of that it is actually a great way for us to try and model something that we expect could happen in reality and and we're trying to figure out solutions when you have a problem a complex problem you go simulate the problem you try different solutions you model it and then and then you see what happens and after doing it a lot of times you probably have a better idea of what is it that is going to work in real life so that's why simulations are very important so this is all that we're gonna do today uh as an example the idea was to try to show you this brand new activity that we just released you know outbreak is new and you're one of the first ones that see uh this activity and you can play it on your own remember uh code.org outbreak go to our website go to our platform type code.org outbreak and you can spend some time with it i actually recommend that you spend quite some time so that you can run a lot of simulations and repeat the action so that you can see that every time that you do it it's gonna turn out a little bit differently so i want to thank you good job natalia for helping us code here do you have fun yeah it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun right i especially like the monsters and the shapes they're so cool so thank you so much for joining us uh thank you so much for being part of doing an hour of code during computer science education week i invite you to continue doing outbreak and i invite you to explore all the other tutorials that we have in the code.org platform in all the curriculum that we have available for all of you to learn computer science which is a critical critical skill that you will need to be successful throughout all your life thank you oh and don't forget tomorrow we have another episode of code bytes and you if you come and join us you're going to learn how to do apps for good so please join us tomorrow for our next episode of code bytes bye everyone you
