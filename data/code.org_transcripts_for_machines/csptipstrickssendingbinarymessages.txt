in this lesson your students are going to work in pairs to build a physical device for sending messages back and forth these devices will communicate binary information or information that can be represented in two possible ways in order to successfully communicate with their partners students will need to develop three things first a question that has a binary response second a device for sending messages and third a system for communicating over that device so you're gonna have to come up with your question you're gonna have to come up with your device and you're gonna have to come up with your rules and you're gonna document all of those things you're gonna actually build your device because in a lot of cases you might not just want to use a slinky you might want to put stuff together and then we're going to send messages to one another while students are choosing their materials it's really really important that they think about the fact that they're going to have to deal with different situations in terms of physical setup so right now they'll be able to see one another but later on there will be obstacles so they need to be considerate of that fact while they're making this initial selection both partners who build the device have to agree on the rules for how to use it in order to send their messages yeah you want to test it sure let's do it this lesson explores the cs principal's big ideas of creativity and abstraction these physical devices will be built out of miscellaneous supplies like flashlights cups and string slinkies and whistles as students work on their device you should challenge them to handle different conditions for example if students build a device like this one that depends on both partners being able to see each other then it won't work if the two are separated by putting one of them around the corner and out of view as students test their devices under different conditions they'll need to update their rules and the physical system itself in order to deal with the new conditions some students might realize that their devices actually have more than two possible states which is why it becomes really important that they have clear instructions for using the device for example if a group uses cups in string to build a traditional telephone setup then there are way more than two possible conditions of the device one set of rules might have you tug the cord while your partner waits to feel for the tugs and another set of rules for the exact same device could instruct you to tap the cup or pluck the string while your partner listens for the taps or plucks the rules might not always be obvious so make sure your students are really clear about how they expect the devices to be used you should have written down with your partner what your question is and what your two possible responses are and then you should also write down the rules for using your device students should focus here on the fact that the same device can be used to answer any binary question the goal is to have not a purposebuilt tool that's only useful for answering one thing but instead something that can abstract out and standardize different signals for answers a and b this way the meaning of answer a or the meaning of answer b could change but the device is still generally useful for a more complex system we can think about how to combine two possible states of our device in order to represent even more things if we go back to the flashlight example from before then our two states are the light on or the light off but we can represent way more than two things by combining sequences of on and off for devices that truly have two states like a flashlight it can be challenging to send a sequence of the same state over and over again for example if a student wants to send a sequence of five consecutive off states how does the recipient know when one ends in the next one starts this problem is foreshadowing of the binary number system and the binary representation of information the devices simulate a really basic version of the physical system that real electronic and digital gadgets use for communication every day we'll learn a lot more about how those work soon
