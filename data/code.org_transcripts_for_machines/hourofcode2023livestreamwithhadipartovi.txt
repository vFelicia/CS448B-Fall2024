good morning everyone happy hour of code happy Thursday we are almost done with Computer Science Education week thank you for choosing to join us this morning we have something very special in store for you of course we're having a guest to talk to us about computer science artificial intelligence and hour of code this year if you have any questions we'd love to hear from you what's on your mind what would you like to know pick our brains uh please go to bitly school question or scan this QR code my name is Tanya Tanya Parker I work at code.org and I help run the hour of code campaign and I'm going to introduce to you our guest who really needs no introduction but he is a tech entrepreneur served as an early advisor and investor at many of tech startups including Facebook Dropbox Airbnb and Uber and in 2013 he and his twin brother Ali founded code.org to create computer science curriculum for K through 12 students please join me in welcoming code.org founder and CEO Hadi ptoi welcome Hadi thank you for joining us hi there how are you doing well thanks how are you doing I'm great and hi to the classrooms for joining us uh today on the this uh fourth day of the week of the hour of code and to celebrate Computer Science Education week my voice is a little scratchy I don't actually have a cold uh I've just kind of lost my voice for the last few months um from overusing my voice H but otherwise I'm feeling great thank you so much for joining us despite that and continuing to share your voice and your thoughts um so hotti has a short presentation for us to get started with and we'll have uh some time at the end for Q&A so as you're listening along think about what questions you have save that tell them to your teacher so that they can submit us and tell us and if you're in the zoom chat you can also uh chat with us in zoom and send us your questions I'll hand it off to you Hadi sure well I was going to present some slides about a couple things why I started code.org in the hour of code and why it's important to teach computer science in schools uh as part of basically a basic education for students and a little bit about the future of computer science in an age of artificial intelligence uh let me first just make sure you can actually see my slides Tanya can you see my slides okay I'm just going to assume the answer is yes you can I can all right so uh I start most of my presentations with a story in my own personal story but before I do that I want to talk about uh a different story or really a famous quotation by Steve Jobs the founder of Apple computer and the creator of the iPhone uh and and the iPad and the iMac uh and he's been one of my personal Inspirations for when I started Cod and he uh said a really interesting thing that is really the heart of why I started code.org he said any child any person when you grow up and you learn about the world around you you learn of it as a closed world a world that was built before you a world that doesn't change and people kind of tell you not to try to change too many things don't don't push against things too much don't bash into the walls uh and you know as you grow older your entire life changes when you learn one thing and that's when you learn that everything around you was created by people no different than yourself and that you can change things you can influence things you can help write the story of what the world is going to look like in the future and once you learn that it changes everything in terms of your outlook on life and it turns you into a Creator and that really is the heart of not only why I started code.org to unleash human potential to help every student learn how to create and how to influence and change the world it really is the motivation between behind all of Education which is unleashing human potential uh and this connects a lot to my personal story uh this is a photo of myself and my identical twin brother uh when we were about five years old or four years old I'm the one on the left hand side of this photo uh and when this photo was taken uh we were living in tahan Iran in the Middle East and not long after the photo was taken our country broke into a Islamic revolution and a war broke out with our neighboring country of Iraq it was really a terrible uh place and time to grow up as a child during the day we were living in in fear of the morality police at night we would go into the basements with kerosene lamps while they were bombing our neighborhoods uh and you know in the morning we'd wake up and go to the roof to see whose houses were still standing it it was a really really rough time if you see images now of what's going on in the Middle East in Gaza it was not not very different than that but my life changed dramatically when my father and mother brought home a magical gift for us uh they gave us a computer a Commodore 64 and at the time uh I actually have an example of what this looks like this was the nicest computer you could get it was this big and it had 64 kilobytes of ram this is like an actual cometer 64 believe it or not but that wasn't the magical gift the magical because it didn't have any apps it didn't have any games you could almost do nothing with it uh but the gift was a book an introduction to basic programming and coding and so they're living in a time of revolution in war my escape from the world around me was to learn how to code and I realized that with coding you can bring your own dreams to life you can create things you can create games apps uh and that's how I got my start and when my family came to the United States uh you know we were immigrants we had very little money actually we had no money we didn't have a home we didn't have a car H but what I had was a really good understanding of computer science and so I managed to start working at tech companies when I was 15 years old and I basically have had a a multiyear career in Tech working at some of the greatest companies advising some of the most famous companies in the world starting my own startups and then afterwards uh you know starting code.org and so my story is really a story about opportunity and the American dream and part of the reason I started code.org is because the world of opportunity and the future of work is changing and most kids going through the education system and school system and graduating don't have the same chances I did because of school not Preparing People for the future and I want to talk a little bit about what the future is looking like uh and that future is coming very quickly and this is especially relevant for people if you think about the jobs that most Americans end up in if you look at uh people working in stores people driving trucks people working in manufacturing people working in food prep that's roughly half of the jobs in our country uh and meanwhile there are robots that already know how to flip Burgers there are robots that already know how to make salads a lot of food preparation like chopping carrots or or slicing onions is now at the point where robots can do it and that's not just the future it's today there's already cars that know how to drive themselves without a human driver and that's soon going to mean that the job of a truck driver can be done by a robot that's driving the truck in fact not in the future but today there are tractors that can help Farm without an actual farmer here's a tractor that's basically farming the land and nobody's even driving it and speaking of farming there's now robots that know how to pick strawberries there's robots that know how to pick tomatoes uh these are again some of the most common jobs in our country and the food you eat is increasingly not being prepared by humans or or even grown by humans it's being done by robots uh if any of you in school has have used 3D printing another thing that's coming this isn't really in in use at scale is homes that are 3D printed this is an entire house that's being built by a 3D printer there's no humans building this home there's no construction workers it's just a robot laying cement uh and and you know putting a home together now You' think that these types of robotic things are going to change manual work the work that people do with their hands but actually the fastest type of work that's changing is desk work or digital work for for example the work of a radiologist uh you know somebody who looks at xrays to look for diseases uh you know a few years ago algorithms got to the point where they could do a better job than humans at detecting diseases and people said well the algorithm is going to detect the disease but you still need a human to explain what's going on uh and then in the last few months the same folks that created chat GPT created an AI that even explains what going on in the in the Xray so really a lot of the work that the radiologist is doing is being done by Ai and this is going to have this type of impact is going to have great impacts in medicine but also in Creative Fields like in Art here's an example of art that wasn't created by a human it was created by a computer here's art that won a national uh prize but the artist wasn't human it was an AI um there's another type of job that's going to be changing when I was growing up everybody the sort of favorite job among kids was to one day be an astronaut these days if you ask kids the job they most aspire to be it's to become an influencer uh which itself is just a sad story uh but that's not going to be as easy because even being an influencer is changing this here is an influencer on social media who's not a real human being uh he or she is actually a digital creation of AI it's not an actual human it's just an imaginary virtual influencer and increasingly on social media and soon even in in magazines and movies we're going to see people who are not people but they are just virtual and then lastly almost all of desk work is increasingly being impacted by technology if you've used chat GPT or Google's Bard or Microsoft's copilot these generative AI tools can already do things like write a 1,000w essay about the French Revolution or create a presentation or a lesson plan that explains photosynthesis or to write a short story and you tell it what you want in the story and the AI will create the story for you or if you like coding you can tell AI to design the user interface for an app and then to write the code for it uh and there's many many more possibilities and this is technology that's changing all the time and so as you think about what is already available today and what what things are going to look like in the 10 next 10 years there's many questions that this brings up lots of people are asking about Technology's impact on work but since we're talking about education in school there's a more fundamental question young for younger people and for teachers which is what is the role of Education in an age of artificial intelligence what is the job that teachers and schools should do and what should students learn now at code.org we believe that AI artificial intelligence and computer science should be foundational parts of basic education changing what we teach students you know right now every student learns how the digestive system works in biology they learn a bit how about how light bulbs and electricity work every student learns about math and in the future every student or not in the future starting now to prepare for the future every student should also learn what an algorithm is or how the internet works or how artificial intelligence is changing Society and we should learn these things not just to learn how the world works but also because of the thing I said at the very beginning of my talk about helping children unleash their human potential and their creativity and to learn that they can change the world because when you learn computer science you can learn by Elementary School that you can create beautiful art using Code by Middle School you can learn how to create games instead of just playing games on your phone and by high school you can create apps and learning creativity is is really one of the most important aspects of Education um this isn't just sort of an idea it's something that now hundreds of millions of students have been doing uh we've had so many amazing stories about students on code.org like this kid dowy manigot who built an app to help domestic abuse victims call for help or Safi saani who helped when the pandemic started she created an app to find out which restaurants were open or Spencer Applegate uh who lives in a one of the poorest towns in Kentucky and he recreated the billion dooll game of Tetris on code.org or Katie Clemens in Missouri who created an app to help her friends diagnose their own mental health these are just examples of over 100 million students who've used code.org to create but the problem is that most schools don't teach computer science those of you who are joining this call right now you're among the lucky few schools who do teach computer science but this is something that collectively thanks to the passion of millions of teachers we are changing the education system there's now over 80 million students learning on code.org right now and of them almost half are young women half are from black Latino or other underrepresented backgrounds racially or ethnically almost half or lowincome and collectively they've created over over 250 million projects almost a quarter of a billion projects created by the students on code.org um so this is really an amazing Global movement you know there are more students on code.org than there are in the entire United States and to end my presentation I just wanted to say a thank you to all of the teachers all around the world who have helped bring computer science to their classrooms to help us change the world of Education my life would have been incredibly different if I didn't have the basic understanding of computer science and if I think about the all the kids in the world what would the world look like if every student had the same access that I had growing up or that dowy manigat or Sophie SA johni or Spencer Parker or Katie Clemens had what would the world look like uh and to answer that question I have a very short video from students on code.org that I wanted to play for you the world has some big problems but I'm little what can I do even when problems seem big we can tackle them one step at a time our generation can help make a more prosperous Equitable and sustainable world I'm warning to code I'm designing apps that solve local problems I'm programming robots I'm learning computer science to make change happen because with technology we could build robots to clean World oceans we can program drones to detect forest fires quickly we can empow young women with digital skills and tools we can program mobile apps to streamline farming in cor rural areas we can use genan sequencing to diagnose diseases and create personalized medicine to cure them I'm little but don't look at my size look at my potential I can make change happen I can make change happen I can make change happen I can make change happen thank you very much and happy Computer Science Education week thank you so much for sharing that hottie um I just wanted to also invite a few of the attendees here in this call if you are uh interested in coming on camera and having uh become I'm going to promote you as a panelist so that you can ask some of your questions live say hi to hottie here do chat me if you're interested and I will bring you up on screen I'll give you a few minutes to prepare if you'd like um just to get started we had some followup questions on your presentation so um when you mention mentioned the robots that are taking over in farming for example or automated driving uh do you think that AI technology will replace these jobs because there aren't people in these jobs anymore so your question is is AI gonna take away people's jobs or replace jobs um there are some cases where AI is going to replace jobs uh but much more commonly jobs are going to be taken by people who know how to use AI people who know how to use AI are going to take jobs away from people who don't know how to use AI uh artificial intelligence is quickly becoming one of the most powerful tools and giving people superpowers and people who know how to use that superpower are going to be among the most valuable people in the workplace that's part of why uh it's important to to teach this as part of Education Tanya you're on mute and also miss Garner wanted to yes I'm going to I do have a classroom here we're going to show here as a panelist Miss Garner please welcome um hopefully you saw that invitation and we'll see you joining here in a second um another question while she gets set up here so somewhat related to that follow up will robots and artificial intelligence take over the world um will robots and artificial intelligence take over the world hi kids it's great to see you hello um well I would say since the beginning of time technology not the beginning of time but since humans have since the beginning of humans existence on this planet our technology has been taking over the world that if you look at today's world it is very very different than what it looked like before humans were around uh the things we learn how to build are taking over the world cars are everywhere before we had cars nobody imagined these robotic things driving around on Wheels um and you know phones almost everybody every adult uh increasingly has a smartphone that does these amazing things and smartphones you could say are also taking over the world so the technology we build is taking over the world and the newer versions whether it's the things adults create or the things that children like the ones in Miss Garner's class right now what you create when you create technology you can get to change the world that was it taking over the world I don't know about that but we're changing our world that's what humans do thank you Miss gner we have a second grade classroom here in Illinois thank you so much for joining us hi what's your name oh a little bit louder can you say one more time oh nice to meet you do you have a question for hottie her name is Yas me Yas me nice to meet you nice and close honey there you go okay ask our question what you recommend students for students our our age we're starting code we're starting code hi yasm I love your question and by the way my uh son Mazy is in fourth grade so he's only a couple two years older than you at and in fact when I created code.org uh my daughter Sophia was your age uh and so a lot of the things I put inside code.org were because of my own kids and seeing what would they enjoy playing with uh now what would I recommend for a second grader who wants to learn code I I would recommend trying the activities on code.org the ones that I think are the most most fun the Flappy Bird activity if you haven't tried that is one of the most fun things we made we love that everybody give a big thumbs up do you know how Flappy Bird on code.org was created uh Flappy Bird 10 years ago was a game that a a young boy in Vietnam created Flappy Bird and it went viral all around the world everybody was playing this game on their phones and this was like a teenager who had made it uh and he got so overwhelmed that people with people with the popularity of the game that he made that it he got kind of scared and he basically erased it and got rid of it and so for a week everybody in the world was playing Flappy Bird and then it disappeared you couldn't download it anymore it didn't exist uh and my team at c.org had been playing it and we were enjoying it and we said why don't we make a coding activity for every student to make their own Floppy Bird so that everybody could uh make a game just like that boy in Vietnam had made uh and it's something we made in about three or four days a guy named Brent on our team put it together and uh in 10 years it hasn't lost its popularity it's among my favorite things and everybody's favorite things besides Flappy Bird I would suggest you try our dance party activity uh dance party with AI is something we just put out with artificial intelligence and it lets you learn how to code a dance and then you can also dance your own dance after you write the code for it and that's also super fun thank you so much did you say thank you thank you all right we are loving we are loving code.org so much they were so excited when they came in today they said are we gonna play that flat paper game again and I said yes we are so they are super excited and I did show them dance Pary so that's our next job we're gonna do so we're doing exactly what he would he recommends us to do great job everybody do you have someone else in your class with another question thank you yes Meine ask a question come up okay what's your name Naomi hi Naomi do you want to ask your question um do people control the robots right now almost all the robots that that are made are controlled by humans in some way but sometimes they control it every move it makes but more often they use code just like you're learning to code what the robot's going to do and then they hit the Run button and then the robot but then does its thing so for example if you looked at that tractor that was farming there's not a there's not somebody controlling it like you know like a Xbox controller moving around where's the tractor GNA go what they do is they write code for that tractor just like the code you write on code.org they'll say move turn left move forward you know don't don't go into somebody else's farm and the tractor's going around in circles or or in rows whether it's going back and forth or however it wants to go the path that the tractor is taking is coded by somebody so you could say that that person is controlling the robot but they're not controlling it with their hands they're controlling it with their code and that's part of the reason why it's important to learn computer science and coding a great question thank you naie okay um n did you want to ask a question or should I let Mor go why don't you come on up and you can think hi hi what's your name moram hi moram I have a question um do you like Ninja Turtles or or Mario Bros that's a very important question um I don't know whether you're asking whether I personally do it or whether code.org does it uh I haven't done Ninja Turtles but I have done Mario Bros but uh code.org we don't have the ability to bring every type of game or character or movie into our uh learning platform we have to pick the ones that we think are going to be the most fun uh so every year we do something new so we might do that in the future the other thing is we can't just do whoever we want we need to get their permission so for example for us to make a code.org activity with Star Wars we have to go to the people who make Star Wars which is lucasfilm and Lucas film is part of Disney and getting their permission was really really really really hard uh it took one year of asking until we got the permission to use Star Wars uh every time where you have sort of a cool thing from games or movies inside code.org it takes almost a year of asking permission and working with whoever created that game or created that movie just to get it's not just to get the permission they want to make sure that the way we show their game inside code.org feels right it feels like it was made correctly so for example I want to bring the Marvel Universe into code.org but it's really important for the people at Marvel that it feels legit like it feels part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and doesn't feel like you're leaving like the Marvel characters are leaving their universe and doing something that doesn't belong uh so getting permission to do these things is not easy H I don't know whether we'll have Ninja Turtles anytime soon and we do have a um wakanda forever sort of black panther activity on arco.com and Miss Gardner I can send that to you later that's not made by code.org but one of our many uh activity providers who also helped create new tutorial so hey maybe we will do Marvel soon that'd be kind of cool thank you for your question thank you m you're welcome okay next one more yeah let's do a okay beautiful hi hi hi what's your name Nea Neda where are you from Palin that's wonderful what's your question does robot control theirselves that's a great question do robots control themselves that's one of the hardest questions that computer scientists are thinking about whether it's even possible and what does it mean for for robots or code or technology to control itself and what do it you know what that really begs the question of for a robot or technology to control itself it needs to even know that it is itself to have a sense that it exists to be conscious like when you move your hand you know this is my hand nobody's telling you Neta move your hand you decide I want to move my hand and you know that I am me and I want cake or I want to play Super Mario Bros you know you have your own desires your wants your own needs and you can use your hands and your brain to do what you want and that's what gives you control over yourself we have no idea yet how to do that inside code or inside a robot so right now there's no robot or technology that even knows that it exists let alone having wants and needs or the ability to control control itself what the what we can do right now is make robots that look like they're that they know they exist they seem to want to do things and in fact you can talk to to computers and the computer might tell you I know I'm a computer I am alive you know I want to do things but does it actually know that it's a computer or does it is it just telling you something that somebody else coded it to do right now the robots and computers don't even know that they exist and they don't even really know what that means they don't have a sense of desire to do anything they only do what we code them to do uh once the robots know that they exists and actually have their own desires or wants and needs to control things the world is going to be very very different but that uh most people don't think that's going to happen for many many decades so tens 10 20 30 years so you might be 40 years old when that happens or even older wow thank you for your question it was great to meet you we could take one last question who'd like to come up hi what's your name my name is Elias nice to meet you Elias what's your question um so how do robots control themselves Well robots don't control themselves but as I answered when Naomi asked about this programmers Like You by writing code can control robots so next activity you do with Miss Garner coding on code.org imagine that you're writing code to control a robot what you see on the screen might just be a Flappy Bird it might be something else but the same code that you write is how people can code robots people like you writing code are the ones that are controlling the robots wow that's amazing isn't that amazing yeah what do we say thank you Miss Garner's class and thank you students for asking your wonderful questions we're so glad you could join us uh so as hotti mention and it looks like Miss Gardner's class is going to do I'm going to show you if you haven't seen it yet uh go to code.org Dan this is code.org newest hour of code activity that we launched last week than dance party AI Edition so if you've already dance done dance party before in a previous AR of code this one's new we're going to use um artificial intelligence and learn about generative AI to create fancy backgrounds that are generated by the AI bot based on some emojis that you choose um and you get to use songs from some of the top artists of today like mile Cyrus Lady Gaga Little Nas X BTS so hopefully you find a song that you really enjoy make your own dance party with your characters dancing to that song and you get to use AI to create a fun video for your dance so check it out and I'd love to see all of your dance parties if you have permission from your parents or your teacher uh please post on social media tag us with hash hour of code uh and I'd love to see your dance moves let's give a big round of applause to hottie thank you so much for joining us and for sharing your insights and thank you again to miss Garner and all of our viewers for joining us happy hour of code oh hi you're muted one more also thank you to miss Conor and Miss Ryman and the other teachers who signed off in the last minute or so thank you enjoy bye bye
