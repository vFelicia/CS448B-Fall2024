what computer science is it's a way to impact the world I was exposed to computer science courses as early as sixth grade like when I was nine when I was 13. fourth grade I was 11. it was cool from the beginning for them they were showing other classes they were doing this they were showing their friends they were showing their families we Integrated Science with this programming and I saw my scores go up 30 percent it's foundational for any type of work when I grow up I want to be a music writer on the computer why do you want to be when you grow up Olivia and I do programming in astronaut for a newer teacher that hasn't had the experience with it once you see it being used and see the successes that the kids have you wouldn't want to not have it in your class the skills the way of thinking the problem solving pieces that they learn in those classes they'll be able to use in mathematics and science and even the English language arts you guys have a lot everyone else hasn't learned yet we designed the code.org courses to feel like a game you're writing simple code to solve puzzles to get to the next level and these puzzles even use real game characters like Angry Birds and the programming uses visual blocks instead of typing which is how introductory programming is taught at leading universities these days because it's easier for the kids to get started and as a teacher you get a dashboard showing your students progress throughout the course this program got 100 of my students engaged and involved in participating nice work you guys this is so fun at first I was like kids fourth grade coding really are we sure we want to go there the learning is still there the information is not changing our students have changed and we as teachers need to change along with that which challenge are you taking on but if we take on the challenge and do it I can only imagine where our kids are going to be tomorrow have you done it before yes it's cool is it really fun yes we love it and my school's doing it yes I love it I love code.org as an organization and as a curriculum oh my God whoa it has to move three steps let's turn right and then ask to go straight again they're not just doing programming but they're actually using it to express what they've learned in math and reading and our normal curriculum for this side adjacent to this one you need to change that that's the main thing oh yeah just the other piece about learning how to think I mean how do we go wrong here you know I don't know that we do programming is fun and pretty easy you can do anything your mind wants to do I guess I'd like to encourage administrators and teachers to just be open to the idea because I know that initially I was skeptical if it's something engaging and it's something fun for them and it builds these critical thinking problems solving skills then we're only setting them up for success in it we should be using it I feel pretty passionate about making sure that we're equipping our kids with a real tool set when they leave K12 education and that's part of our test is to educate students that you know what computer science is not for them over there or somewhere else that's for you here now
