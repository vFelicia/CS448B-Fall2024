hello and welcome to code bite today we're going to be learning all about making apps for good we're gonna make two apps together both for good causes so this week we're celebrating the hour of code and millions of students are learning basic computer science and the hour of code has actually passed one billion student engagements reaching students in every city and every country in the world my name is hannah walden i'm a curriculum developer at code.org and this is my nephew joining me today leo who's going to be helping us out hi leo hi hi uh thank you great no i'm i'm in 11th grade fantastic all right and we are also joined by you at home so many students that want to learn to code in our huge global classroom even more students are joining in as we're getting started here so let's actually look at the map and see who's with us here today oh wow okay so we've got people all over north america we've got some in alaska in canada is that venezuela down there uh my screen's kind of small can't quite see that uh looks like we've got some over in uh in afghanistan wow we've got people all over the world this is really great i live up in maine which is in the northeast corner of the united states so it's exciting to see all these people who are joining us today so before we get started on our main content uh this week in addition to being computer science education week i guess as a part of computer science education week there's a lot of birthdays that we've been celebrating so yesterday we celebrated grace hopper's birthday and today we are going to celebrate someone else's birthday so i'm going to share my screen now so you can see who we are going to celebrate all right so happy birthday aydah lovelace all right leo based on this picture i just want you to give me kind of a guess what do you what do you think aydah lovelace is famous for any ideas um being pretty yeah i'm looking at this here maybe you know olympic gold in fan holding or something like that uh no actually ada lovelace um she is known for being the first programmer um way back in the 19th century she was born in 1815 and she was the daughter of the poet lord byron and uh byron was kind of known for being uh sort of a wild guy um and so aydah's mother decided that uh she didn't want aydah going down that pathway so she decided that she was going to be tutored in mathematics well aydah uh not only succeeded in mathematics and became a fantastic mathematician um she also retained some of the wild child side which i think is fantastic uh and her um you know she had this outlook on life that uh when she was you know looking at math and science and things like that she called it a poetical science which i think is really cool but anyway the thing that she programmed she was friends with charles babbage and he had this idea for this analytical engine um which was never fully built but it would look like this if it had been built during his time and essentially it was a way to calculate numbers uh different equations and things like that and ada she uh wrote some notes about how this machine was used and uh basically ended up writing the first algorithm the first program that really showed how this machine could be used uh to go even further than just calculating basic equations so we credit ada with being the first programmer and i love her she's fantastic so that is our story about ada lovelace so i'm gonna stop sharing now and leo uh we're gonna talk a little bit about you now um because i think it'd be great if everybody got to know you a little bit better uh so you can can you tell us a little bit more about yourself how old you are some of your interests where you live um i'm 16. i live in durham and i like reading writing and drawing ah all very good indoor activities for pandemic yeah so you live in durham north carolina and uh so when you are able to go outdoors what are the kind of activities you like doing outdoors um i like hiking and like picnics and just spending time with family outside on walks oh that's great because today we're gonna build an app uh that is all related to the outdoors but it has kind of a twist on it it's not just about the outdoors it's about volunteering for the outdoors and every time i've been down in durham to visit you i just noticed that there's a wonderful community there people like to help each other out do you like getting involved in the community there yeah i really like volunteering a lot yeah great all right so uh let's let's build this app together so to kick us off i'm gonna share my screen there we go uh and let's take a look at the basics of this app uh before we build a couple additions to it so this is our domore durum app and we've got two buttons on this screen and if i click on the veggie button this is going to take me to a page with some links to websites that you can volunteer at different community gardens in durham and what i want to show you here is that i can click on the home button and i can go back so i can navigate i'm going to go here to my parks this is what we're going to be building and i can navigate back so there's all different ways i can use my app if i click on the seeds button i can continue on and then i go to the website so let's build this together leo you ready all right so here we are this is app lab and what's so great about app lab is that you can design the look and feel of your app make it just as you want so i've already got the home screen here but like i said we're gonna build the park screen together so you can notice it's just a blank screen here uh so leo um maybe you could guide me here if i want to make some buttons on my screen what would i do uh you would drag out the button element yeah right there so i'm dragging out the button element i can resize it i can make it big i can make it little um and the first button this is going to take us to the eno river association what do you know about the eno river leo um there's a lot of good trails it's along the water there's marshes and it's very um it's very important to people in durham i guess yeah yeah so we want to keep it really nice we want to protect it so there's lots of volunteer opportunities there so we're going to call this the eno button and this is going to take us information about the eno river association uh now leo um looking at this button what do you think about it do you want to change the way it looks at all um don't make it a circle all right let's make it a circle so if we go down to the bottom here i can change the border radius and all i have to do is push these arrows up and down and i can change you can see on the screen but it's changing how much the radius is so let's i'm going to bump this way up uh and kind of drag it around and i've got a circle okay fantastic all right so let's make another button and i can just duplicate this so it looks exactly the same and this button is going to go to durham central park and durham central park also has a lot of ways you can get involved in your community and volunteer so let's just change this to we'll call this the central button durham central park okay all right that's looking okay i'll show you one other thing leo uh when i click on this screen here i can change the background of it so i'm gonna choose an image here and i'll just choose that same bridge from the first picture okay that's looking all right um let's see maybe maybe we should make the borders a little bit thicker what do you think yeah okay so let's go down and we're going to make them a little bit thicker i think 10 looks good and maybe a different color what color do you like um blue okay try out a blue i kind of like that all right i'm going to copy this color and remember that my border width was 10 and do the same thing here so my border width is 10. and there we go okay that's looking pretty pretty good um but actually you know what there's another way that we can change the look and feel for our app we can use themes so those of you at home this is where you're going to get involved you're going to help us pick a theme so a couple different options here we've got lemonade that's how that would look we've got watermelon we've got let's see um crushed velvet and peachy all right let's throw up a poll and see uh what people at home want to do all right seeing some some answers come in here let's give it three more seconds three two one and close the poll all right uh what do we got here leo uh lemonade's the winner lemonade is the winner i do like that nice and clean that looks good all right so uh let's run our app um i click here uh uhoh why is it not working leo i haven't programmed it i haven't told it to do anything so let's let's do that um so i was just in design mode now i'm going to go to code mode it's time to program this app um but let's actually see if people at home know what we need to do so basically what i want to have happen is when i click on this button i want to go to not that one i want to go to this screen so knowing that all of you at home we're going to throw up a poll which block should we use to change the screen when the button is clicked we could use an on event button a set check button show element or set screen let's put the poll up all right answers are coming in all right all right we'll give it two more seconds one two and let's close the poll all right so what do you see here leo what's the top choice uh set screen all right yeah so this is actually kind of a trick question there are two blocks that we need to change the screen we do need the set screen block and then we also need the the second choice here that i see is the most popular second most popular choice which was the on event block so well done everybody nice job all right so let's go here we're going to drag out this on event block now if you have been watching any of the other code break code by episodes um you'll know that we've been talking a lot about events so events trigger when you do something so when we click on this button we're gonna go somewhere so this button is called the park button let's go ahead and change that fantastic okay leo and where are we gonna go when we click the park button uh park screen yeah so we're going to grab this set screen and we're going to go to the park screen let's test it out it works but nothing's working here so now we need to program these buttons so we need to use our on event again and this is the let's go to our park screen and i can hover over to see what it is this is the eno button so we go to the eno button and now we want to go to this website so what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy the url bring it back over here and i'm going to grab all the way down at the bottom of the toolbox there's this really great block called the open block and this will open a website so we don't want to open the code.org website i'm going to paste in the eno river website so that works um and now to do this button we're just going to copy paste there we go um and we just got to change it up so not the eno button which button is that leo that's the looks like the central button and let's grab the url here pull it in okay let's test it out run here central and we're going to our website and it works all right um one quick last thing that we should have done in our design mode when we're on the park screen we should make a home button so we can go back to the home screen so i'm just going to grab home grab a button out here i'm going to call it my home button um and uh let's see this is my home button number two because i have one on the other screen and let's see let's um let's grab an image here to put there i'm gonna choose icons and i can search for pop that in there and there now now i just need to program it do the same thing gonna grab copy paste and now i'm gonna do my home button and that is gonna go to not gonna open something i'm gonna set the screen and go to the home all right we're ready let's test it out here here and i go home here here and i go home all right but this is not as exciting as testing it out on your phone so all of those of you at home or leo you can grab your phones and you can actually scan this qr code that is up on the screen right now and we're gonna see what this app looks like on leo's phone go ahead and pull it up leo you got it uh yep all right i'm gonna stop sharing so we can see all right go ahead and uh click on one of the there we go all right perfect it works exactly as expected so that was our first app great job uh and i hope that was useful now the second app that we're going to make i'm super excited about this one this one's really fun um so i think you know when we think about making apps for good we think about things like volunteer opportunities which is great uh we can also think about ways that we can help our mental health uh so i don't know leo have you ever seen those youtube videos that are pep talk videos that are like you got this you can do this uh you know a little girl standing up in the mirror saying i'm the best i got this i know i can do this yeah yeah i love those they're so great all right so we can make one of those so we're gonna try that out together um and see how this goes so i'm gonna share my screen again and here we go so here's my app i'm gonna click on this little photo button here i'm gonna choose a photo um and pop it up and see what happens leo does that look familiar i wonder who that is that was from the last time you visited me up in maine in the winter kind of a long time ago um but it says today is your day so uh it pops it up on your um on the screen you kind of basically are able to take a selfie um or choose a photo from your file and i'm gonna stop sharing and i'm going to actually show you all what this looks like on my phone so here is my phone you can sort of see it when i twist it a little bit i'm going to click this button i'm going to take a photo so now i'm going to embarrass myself um and i choose to use that one and then it says on there you are amazing all right so now we're gonna build this app and i'm gonna share my screen again so we can do this here we go okay so i've already got the basics laid out but i'm missing one button so this is the button that gets something from my camera leo any idea what button that might be um photo select yeah the one that looks like a camera great choice okay um i'm gonna refresh my screen because it seems like it's not working right now there we go so i'm going to drag this out i'm going to call this the photo select button and now let's program it so here's how this works when my photo button is clicked when it's changed actually that's what happens when you when you tap on it it's changed it's going to get a picture from your camera and put it on the screen to do that we're going to grab um set image url this block and this is going to set the picture right here the picture output and we're not going to put it to the code.org logo we're going to put it to the picture that shows up here and to do that we're going to grab this block get image and we're going to get the image from photo select and that's all we have to do let's test it out so run and click uh let's see all right since i embarrassed you there's me as a kid and your mom all right great picture but there's no encouraging statement we got to get that up on the screen so the last part we need to do now is we need to get set text there it is um and we're gonna get something from our uh list up here but before we do that audience um we've got a couple different things that we're saying here today is amazing today is your day believe in yourself a whole bunch of options but let's see what options you want to include in our list so go ahead and answer the poll let's see our top two options we're gonna give it two more seconds two one and closing the poll all right leah what are the top two uh reach for the stars and you are strong reach for the stars and you are strong all right here we go perfect okay now uh so we're gonna set the text of our text output to one of these items uh and so let's actually jump over here and talk a little bit about what's going on here so here's my list and this is the first the original list before we added stuff on and when you have a list in javascript which is the language we're programming in the list has a name which goes over here and then each item in the list is at a different location so this is location zero because in computer science we start counting at zero so even though we have three items in our list we have only all the way up to location two so this is location zero location one and location two so let's test out our audience now i'm gonna print out the encouragement at location one what will be printed uh so let's throw up the poll which statement do you think is going to print at location one all right and three two one let's close it what's the answer there leo today is your day today is your day and indeed today is your day because great job people at home you got the right answer you are amazings at position zero today your day is at position one and then believe in yourself is that position two so let's use this information to program our app last part of it all right so um what we're going to do here is we're going to use this list block because we want to get something from the list so encouragement and then in between these square brackets we want to put the location of the phrase we want to put in here but we don't want to choose just one one thing from this list we want it to be anything from this list it's totally random so we're going to use a random block and now leo i need your help here now this random block is telling me to pick something between 1 and 0 and 10. but we wanted to pick something between the first item in the list and the last item in the list so what's the location of the first item in the list zero yeah and the last one four four yeah zero one two three four fantastic all right so with that we're gonna run it and we're gonna test it out i'll put my picture in there and it works all right so like i said before this is not as fun uh if you're not doing it on your phone so let's share this out you at home can also try this uh when you try it on your phone you're not going to get my picture you're going to get your picture your selfie picture with an encouraging statement to kind of give you a a boost today so leo go ahead and scan the code you get it all right i'm going to stop sharing all right leo can you show us what you have all right and go ahead and click the button and take a selfie of yourself fantastic all right and show us oh i love it and what does it say you are strong you are strong good job leo you are strong all right and that is it that is our show thank you everybody for joining us today a couple of notes for you all um if you want to learn how to make your own apps you can either watch the recording of this and follow along or you can try out the intro to app lab our code tutorial and that's at code.org app lab and we want to see all the apps that you make for good causes so if you do make an app go ahead and click share and share it on social media and use the hashtag hourofcode or even the hashtag codebytes we'll find it and we love to see all the creative things you make make sure also that you tune in tomorrow for minecraft heroes journey which is going to be a really interesting episode i'm really looking forward to it i think it's going to be a lot of fun and that's it so thanks for helping me out today leo no problem all right bye everyone you
