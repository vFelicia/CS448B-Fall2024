i think it's really important for girls to study computer science i think for a long time the world thought that some things were for boys and some things were for girls and everyone understands now that boys and girls can have equal opportunity if we could just you know support girls and give them that initial encouragement that we can start balancing the skills and then we won't even have to play with the equation because it will just be a natural flow to be able to code gives you the freedom to build anything and that is is just so empowering i like having that power in my own hands to express what's in my imagination using programming just the experience of programming gives you access to a new method of thinking everything becomes the steps that you can take towards a solution and that is just extremely valuable you know it's one thing to use software it's a totally different thing to get to change how the software you use actually works yeah all my favorite memories from computer science are actually programming together with teams i mean i don't think cs is a solo thing i mean nothing is if you want to build something amazing you usually have to do it in a team and cs is no different you all live in a time where expressing yourself learning about different people making a business and a real difference in your communities is all totally possible with computers it's right at your fingertips it's not about being a girl or being a boy it's about being talented computer science needs more time people who are not afraid of being creative and making the world a better place jump into it learn just try and take one class try and take give it one hour it's amazing what you can learn in one hour and that's what's so exciting about hour of code all of you are able to participate from all parts of the country at all ages from all different backgrounds and that's what will create the right opportunities for everyone every girl deserves to take part in creating the technology that will change our world and change who runs it i challenge girls in every single country to learn one hour of code technology touches every part of our lives so if you can change technology you can change the world
