my name's jasmine i'm 26 years old and i currently work at zillow i'm a software development engineer i think what i really like about programming is that it helps me solve problems that i wouldn't be able to solve on my own especially as someone who's dyslexic i like the fact that programming allows me to repeat something over and over again and i don't have to like worry about misspelling stuff a lot so a programming language is a coding language that's used to dictate specific instructions to a computer just like there are thousands of human languages that are used to communicate amongst humans there are hundreds of different programming languages that have been created for humans to communicate with computers the language you use will often depend on what you're trying to do but nearly all programming languages are equivalent in terms of being able to express any algorithm a programming environment is a formal term for a tool which you use to write and run computer programs in this class you'll be learning the programming language javascript this language is widely used to make interactive websites and mobile apps the programming environment you'll be using is called app lab app lab was designed with new javascript programmers in mind although it was made for novices it has many powerful features which makes creating shareable mobile applications fast and easy we will start by learning to program using a virtual robot called the turtle in app lab the turtle looks like this now i know what you're thinking why are we learning to program with a turtle and why does it look nothing like an actual turtle historically the turtle has been one of the more popular ways to learn to program originally it was an actual robot students could program it to move and turn while the robot dragged a pen on the floor this would create simple drawings the original robot was actually domed in shape which made it kind of look like a turtle hence the name as graphics technology improved turtle programming migrated to the computer here the turtle was sometimes depicted as a little turtle but often just an arrow turtle programming is a powerful metaphor for programming in general starting with simple commands you can build up to some very sophisticated behavior the programming and problem solving techniques you'll learn using the turtle will apply every time you're trying to solve a problem of code this applies whether you're building game designing a mobile application or creating a simulation so let's get started initially you'll have to solve problems only with a very small set of commands in fact you'll have to do everything with only move forward turn left pen up and pin down in app lab here's how you add lines of code you can drag blocks from the toolbox and snap them together then click run to see your code in action or if you prefer you can type the commands in yourself either way you write code you can always flip between block mode and text mode in fact you can work in text mode and drag the blocks out to insert more text if you want to practice typing code that's awesome if you make an error you can use the blocks to check the correct way to enter code if you want to get rid of a line of code that's easy too just drag it off the screen or delete the line of text learning a programming language with the turtle is fun and can require a surprising amount of creativity even if you programmed in a similar way before you'll probably find this simple looking turtle can pose some fun and challenging puzzles as we develop our javascript programming skills we'll eventually leave the turtle behind you
