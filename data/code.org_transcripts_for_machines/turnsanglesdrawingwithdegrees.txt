Hey what's up with angles on code.org? In school I learned that you can make an equilateral triangle with just three 60 degree angles. But on Code.org, I need to make turns of 120 degrees. Why is that? When you measure angles in school, you're usually measuring along the inside of the shape. In Code.org the artist turns along the outside of the shape when you draw a line. If the artist makes no turn, he draws a 180 degree angle. If you want an angle in your shape that's less than 180 degrees, then you need to make your artist turn. If you want to make a shape with a 60 degree angle, then your artist needs to turn 120 degrees. That's because 120 plus 60 equals 180. Maybe you want to draw a square or a rectangle. In that case, you're gonna need a 90 degree angle. A 90 degree angle cuts a hundred and eighty degrees right in half, meaning you'll need a 90 degree turn for your 90 degree angle. What do you do if you want your artist to turn around and come back right it came? In that case, you'll want to make a 180 degree turn. That'll flip your artist right around and send it back in the opposite direction. Fun factwhether you turn right by 180 degrees, or left by 180 degrees, you will end up in the exact same place. Today we talked about a bunch of angles that you'll have the opportunity to play with on Code.org, but there are so many more. Hop online and try them for yourself! Have fun coding!
