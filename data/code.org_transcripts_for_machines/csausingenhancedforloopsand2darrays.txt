hi i'm sharanya i'm a software development engineer at aws iot iot is internet of things as the name says it's a network of things where things can communicate with each other without human interaction what if we wanted a simple way to traverse a twodimensional array an enhanced for loop allows us to go through the entire data structure quickly we've already used enhanced for loops with one dimensional areas to iterate through a list of values since 2d arrays are stored as areas of arrays using enhanced for loops is similar to onedimensional areas we just need two loops let's look at an example using a seating chart from a classroom the outer loop represents traversing each row of the 2d array since each row is an array itself we need to make sure we have the correct data type in our enhanced for loop that's why we define row as an error of strings which moves through each row of our 2d seeding chat the inner loop represents traversing each student in our row it needs to use the same data type as our outer array and it needs to traverse through the same variable we used in our outer array this loop uses a student variable to traverse each student in our row as the loop runs it moves through each element of the array let's add some print statements to our loop and see what gets printed we'll add a print statement inside both loops to print each student and we'll add a print statement outside of the first loop to add a new line between each row as the loop runs our outer loop moves through each row of our 2d array and the inner loop moves through each element in the row and each student gets printed to the console enhanced rule loops are a quick and easy way to access every item in a 2d array for instance things like printing or searching but remember we should not use it when we need to find an index modify values or loop through only part of a list for those situations we should just stick with the standard for loop you
