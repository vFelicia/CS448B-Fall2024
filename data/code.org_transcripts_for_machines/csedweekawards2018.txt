ALRIGHT EVERYONE, IF YOU CAN PLEASE JOIN ME IN GIVING A WARM WELCOME TO THE PRESIDENT OF CODE.ORG, ALICE STEINGLASS. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. LET'S GET STARTED. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE HADI PARTOVI THE CEO AND FOUNDER OF CODE.ORG. [ APPLAUSE ] HI, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO THANK THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, THE ALLEN SCHOOL FOR HOSTING US AND EVERYBODY WHO TRAVELED TO MAKE IT HERE TODAY WHETHER IT IS REGIONAL PARTNER AND THE VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO MADE COMMITMENTS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE TUTORIAL REVIEW COMMITTEE AND ALL OF THE OTHERS HERE WITH US TODAY. I WANTED TO THANK THE DONORS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED THE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION MOVEMENT ESPECIALLY MICROSOFT, AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND ALL THE DONOR WHOSE HAVE SUPPORTED THE WORK WE AND THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE ARE HERE TO KICKOFF CS EDUCATION WEEK. IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO WE KICKED OFF THE HOUR OF CODE CAMPAIGN. IN THE FIVE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN 616 MILLION HOURS DONE BY STUDENTS ENGAGING STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND 48% HAVE BEEN YOUNG WOMEN, 30% IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES, MAKING A MASSIVE CHANGE IN TERMS OF BREAKING STEREOTYPES AND INSPIRING STUDENTS TO TRY COMPUTER SCIENCE. THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF TEACHERS AND AMAZING CELEBRITIES. YOU HAVE SEEN MANY MORE CELEBRITIES COME TO JOIN THIS CAMPAIGN WHERE IT IS FOLKS LIKE SIA, MY CLICKER IS NOT WORKING. MC HAMMER, KATY PERRY AND DOZENS OF CELEBRITIES RANGING FROM ALL THESE FACES HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THIS CAMPAIGN. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT HAS NOT BEEN THE CELEBRITIES, BUT THE TEACHERS. THIS STARTED FROM INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS LIKE JUAN LAZANO WHO IS IN THE ROOM WITH US TODAY. AND ENTIRE 1 MILLION TEACHERS HAVE BEGUN TEACHING COMPUTER SCIENCE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS AS OF THIS WEEK. THE TEACHERS HAVE CHANGED THE CURRICULUM AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER TO CHANGE DISTRICT LEVEL POLICIES AND 46 STATES HAVE CHANGED POLICIES TO SPREAD COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MAKE IT PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL 25 COUNTRIES HAVE MADE MOVES TO ADVANCE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION RELEASED THEIR DECLARATION OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND RECOMMENDING INTEGRATING CODING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR SCHOOL DAY CURRICULUM. TODAY WE ARE GOING TO UNVEIL 200 NEW PLEDGES AND COMMITMENTS TO GLOBAL COMPUTER SCIENCE FROM GOVERNMENTS, CITY, STATES, INDIVIDUAL NONPROFITS AND GLOBAL ORGANIZATIONS. BUT FIRST I WANT TO INTRODUCE A WOMEN WHO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION, ONE OF THE MOST VOCAL SUPPORTERS FOR DIVERSITY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ONE OF THE GREATEST PHILANTHROPIST OF OUR LIFETIME, MELINDA GATES. AND JOINING HER I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MICHELLE DELGADO, A SOPHOMORE AT THAI HIGH SCHOOL. TYEE HIGH SCHOOL. COME ON UP, MICHELLE. THIS IS MICHELLE'S FIRST COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE AND SHE HAS ALREADY RISEN TO THE COP OF HER CLASS. MICHELLE WILL ASK MELINDA A FEW QUESTIONS ON HOW SHE GOT STARTED AND HOW TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO TRY CS. WELCOME MICHELLE TO THE STAGE. > FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK I LOVE TO LEARN HOW YOU STARTED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT LEARNING COMPUTING? I WANT MICHELLE TO TELL YOU HER STORY TOO ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED BECAUSE I THINK OUR STORIES ARE RELATED AND I THINK THEY ARE RELATED FOR MANY YOUNG WOMEN FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE. I WENT TO SCHOOL AT AN ALL GIRL'S GIRL'S CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND I HAD AMAZING TEACHERS INCLUDING A MATH TEACHER. HER NAME WAS MS. BAUER AND SHE WAS TEACHING US MATH AND SHE WENT OFF TO A CONFERENCE AND SAW THESE BRAND NEW COMPUTERS. THEY WERE APPLE TWO. SHE SAID TO THE HEAD PRINCIPAL WE HAVE TO GET THE COMPUTERS FOR THE GIRLS SO SHE CONVINCED THE NUN TO PUT A BUDGET FORWARD FOR FIVE COMPUTERS FOR THE ENTIRE SCHOOL OF 600 PLUS AND HE ASKED US IF ANY OF US WANTED TO JOIN HER AND I SAID SURE WHY NOT. I WOULD LEARN THIS NEW THING, THIS BOX. THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS TEACHER WAS SHE TAPPED INTO OUR CREATIVITY AND TAUGHT US PROGRAMMING BY LETTING US DO THINGS WE WERE INTERESTED IN AND SHE WAS GETTING HER FASTERS AT NIGHT AND SHE WAS NOT AFRAID TO LET US GET OUT AHEAD OF HER WHICH WAS INCREDIBLE. THINK OF THE MESSAGE IT GAVE US. I GOT HOOKED AND I KNEW BY THE TIME I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL I WANTED TO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE IN COLLEGE. HOW DID YOU, MICHELLE, TELL EVERYBODY, GET INTERESTED AT TYEE? MICHELLE GOES TO A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL HERE. IT ALL STARTED WHEN I WAS SMALL. I WOULD SEE MY DAD AND HIS COMPUTER, HE WOULD DO WORK OR DO THINGS SO I WOULD ALWAYS BE CURIOUS AND THEN I WENT TO ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL. THERE WASN'T VERY MANY COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES OR THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD. IT WASN'T UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL MY CGI TEACHER ASKED ME DO YOU WANT TO LEARN THE BASICS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I WAS LIKE YES, I WANT TO LEARN MORE. SO I WENT TO HER CLASS AND RIGHT AWAY I LOVED IT. IT IS CHALLENGING BUT I LOVED IT. SO THAT'S HOW I STARTED COMPUTER SCIENCE. YEAH AND MICHELLE IS BEING HUMBLE HERE BUT SHE HAS RIS ON THE TOP OF HER CLASS AND YOU WILL TAKE THE COMPUTER SCIENCE AP, THE PRINCIPAL'S ONE. THERE YOU GO. DID YOU EVER QUESTION YOUR DECISION TO GET INTO TECH? I WOULD SAY YES, DEFINITELY. I THINK LOTS OF WOMEN HAVE THIS SORT OF UNDERLYING DOUBT OF CAN I DO IT AND THAT'S TRUE IN A LOT OF SCIENCES. I QUESTIONED IT TWICE IN A DEEP WAY. I QUESTIONED IT IN COLLEGE BECAUSE THE PROFESSORS WOULD THROW OUT THESE PROBLEMS WE WERE TO WORK ON AND SOLVE AND JUST SO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME I LOVE PROBLEMS AND I LOVE PUZZLES SO TO ME THEY WERE THIS CHALLENGE BUT WHEN YOU GET THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES LIKE IN ANY NEW FIELD IT SEEMS SO OVERWHELMING THAT YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO IT AND I WOULD SIT THERE AND THINK HOW WILL I DO THIS. AFTER MY FRESHMEN YEAR THERE WERE FEW WOMEN IN MY CLASS BUT I FOUND A GUY THAT I LIKED TO CODE WITH. AND WE WOULD, YEAH, I LATER NOW TELL PEOPLE IT'S THIS GUY THAT SET ME UP LATER TO REALIZE I WOULD LIKE BILL. HE WAS VERY WEAKY AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME BUT WE WOULD GEEKY AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME. WE BOTH GO AWAY AND FIGURE OUT PIECES OF IT AND COME BACK TOGETHER AND START CODING AND I STARTED TO FIGURE OUT WITHOUT REALIZING IT THAT I LIKED TO CODE IN PAIRS AND TEAMS. AND BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY JUNIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE THE ASSIGNMENTS WERE GIVEN AS TEAMS AND I ROSE UP TO BE THE LEADER OF TEAMS AND I REALIZED I LIKE TO MANAGE TEAMS. SO I QUESTIONED IT DEEPLY IN COLLEGE. IF I HAD NOT FOUND THAT PERSON TO CODE WITH I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO STAY. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS STUDYING TO GO TO MED SCHOOL. SHE SAID FRESHMEN YEAR IN COLLEGE SHE ALMOST GAVE UP HER DREAM OF GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL BECAUSE CHEMISTRY WAS SO HARD BUT WHEN SHE GOT A TEAM TOGETHER TO WORK ON THE PROBLEMS SHE KNEW SHE COULD GO ON. SO THE IDEA OF A TEAM WHO YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY OTHER MEN AND WOMEN AND YOU HAVE TO PERSIST AND PUSH THROUGH. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO AS TEACHERS IS INSPIRE. THE LAST STORY I WILL TELL WONDERING IF I SHOULD STAY, NOT WONDERING IF I SHOULD STAY IN TECHNOLOGY BUT WHEN I GOT TO MAKE ARE YOU SOFT I WAS USED TO WORKING AROUND LOT OF GUYS BUT THE CULTURE WAS MORE I WILL JUST SAY VERY ROUGH AND TUMBLE AND I KNEW HOW TO DO THAT, I COULD SEE HOW THE GAME WAS AND I KNEW HOW TO PLAY BUT TWO YEARS IN I WAS NOT HAPPY AND I WAS NOT TURNING INTO THE PERSON I WANTED TO BE. I THOUGHT I HAD THIS JOB OFFER FROM MKENZIE. I LOVED CREATING PRODUCT AND THE INNOVATION AND THE PEOPLE I WAS AROUND AT MICROSOFT. SO I DECIDED TO TAKE A TACT FOR MYSELF WHICH WAS I COULD LEAVE OR TRY BEING MYSELF. AND I TRIED BEING MYSELF AND IT WORKED. AND I STARTED ATTRACTING PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO WORK IN THE SAME CULTURE THAT TYEE WANTED TO WANTED TO WORK IN THE SAME CULTURE SO WHEN I LEARNED THAT ABOUT MYSELF I WAS HAPPIER AND I STAYED. ONE THING WE NEED TO DO FOR WOMEN IS SURROUND THEM WITH OTHER LIKE MINDED MEN AND WOMEN AND WE KNOW WOMEN WILL PERSIST IF THEY SEE COLLEAGUES THAT ARE SUPPORTING AND THEY SUPPORT THEM. WOMEN IN ALL FIELDS ARE BETTER OFF IF THEY HAVE WOMEN COLLEAGUES BUT THIS IS A REASON WE ARE STUCK IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IS WOMEN DON'T SEE MANY ROLE MODELS AND THEY DON'T SEE IT BEING WELCOMING AND THEY WONDER WILL THEY HAVE ANOTHER WOMAN ON THEIR TEAM BUT IF YOU PUT MORE WOMEN ON THEIR TIME THEY WERE PERSIST AND THIS IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO GET MORE WOMEN INTO TECH. THAT'S VERY GOOD. SO HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN AND UNDER REPRESENTATIVED MINORITIES TO TRY COMPUTER SCIENCE. I THINK IT IS TEACHERS, THAT REMINDING KIDS ANY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW IT IS HARD AND GIVING THEM THEIR CONFIDENCE TO PERSIST BUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THOUSANDS MORE TEACHERS LIKE YOU I LOVE WHAT NEW YORK CITY IS DOING WHERE THEY HAVE A GOAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR ALL AND BY 2025 THEY WILL HAVE TRAINED ENOUGH TEACHERS, THEY WILL TRAIN 5,000 TEACHERS SO EVERY KID IS EXPOSED TO COMPUTER SCIENCE DURING THERE K12 TIME. WE NEED TO EXPOSE KIDS AND THEN WE NEED TO WORK ON THE TRANSITIONS, THE PATHWAYS INTO COLLEGE. WHEN A YOUNG GIRL GETS INTO COLLEGE SHE WILL SEE THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS AND THEY ARE PRETTY FAR ALONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF CODING ALREADY SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE AT THE ENTRY COURSE MORE WELCOMING AND MAKE THE PROBLEM SET INTERESTING TO GIRLS AND HAVE ASSOCIATE PROFESSORS WHO ARE WOMEN, YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE WOMEN ARE SURROUNDED IN TEAMS. WE ARE SEEING PROGRESS IN A BUNCH OF UNIVERSITIES, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, HARVEY, SEVERAL OTHERS HARVARD, SEVERAL OTHERS SO WE HAVE TO DO MORE AT K12 FOR SURE LIKE CODE. ORG TO MAKE SURE KIDS ARE WELCOME AND MAKE THE TRANSITION INTO COLLEGE GO SMOOTHER AND EASIER FOR WOMEN. THE NUMBER OF WOMEN CS DEGREES WAS 37% WHEN I GRADUATED. WE THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE RISE. YOU LOOK AT LAW AND MEDICINE THEY ARE AT 5050. LAW IS JUST SLIGHTLY SURPASSING MORE WOMEN THAN MEN. AT CS WE ARE AT 19%. FOR A DECADE WE HELD AROUND 18 TO 20% OF CS GRADUATES AS WOMEN. WHEN YOU IN THE CASE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND HOW PERVASIVE IT IS AND THE AMAZING THINGS WE ARE DOING AND WHERE WE ARE GOING, I COULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OF A PHONE IN MY POCKET THAT HAD THAT MUCH COMPUTING POWER. SO THIS IS PERVASIVE. THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST JOBS. THEY ARE SUPER INNOVATIVE. WOMEN HAVE A LOT OF CREATIVITY AND A LOT OF THINGS TO CONTRIBUTE SO WE HAVE TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE WE HAVE TO BEND THE CURVE AND NOT MAKE INCREMENTAL CHANGES, WE HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SO ANY IDEAS FUNNEL THEM TO ME BECAUSE I AM OPEN. WE HAVE GOT TO GET WOMEN INTO THIS FIELD. SO WHAT ROLE CAN COMPANIES PLAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS? I THINK A LOT OF THINGS WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES DO, OFFERING INCREDIBLE INTERNSHIPS IN THE SUMMERS, HELPING TRAIN MORE TEACHERS AND HELPING POINT TOWARDS ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND TEACHERS ALSO NEED SUPPORT. WE KNOW PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU NEED A LEARNING COMMUNITY AROUND YOU WHEN YOU TEACH THE NEW AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPALS CLASS. YOU NEED TOOLS TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO TEACH THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN MAYBE I HAVE TAUGHT COMPUTER SCIENCE BEFORE OR WHAT OTHER TEACHER HAS A GREAT IDEA FOR BRINGING IN MORE YOUNG WOMEN OR UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES. WE HAVE TO CREATE THE LEARNING COMMUNITIES FOR TEACHERS AND I THINK INDUSTRY HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN THAT AS WELL. WE ALL DO. IT IS GOING TO TAKE OTHER TEACHERS AND INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT. IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US TO PUSH THIS FIELD FORWARD. TO WRAP UP ON A FUN NOTE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT A FAVORITE COMPUTER RELATED TELEVISION OR BOOK? WHAT I CALL MIND CANDY NIGHT BILL AND I LOVE TO WATCH SILICON VALLEY AND WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO ON IN THE SERIES IF THE OTHER ONE IS NOT HOME AND TRAVELING BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN WATCHING IT TOGETHER. ALL THE INSIDE JOKES WE LOVE. THANK YOU, MICHELLE. YOU'RE WELCOME. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE HADI BACK ON STAGE AND JAKE BASKIN. THEY WILL PRESENT THE 2018 CS CHAMPIONS AWARD BUT AN AWARD IS NOT AN AWARD UNLESS YOU GET HIGH FIVES FROM A BUNCH OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. SO WE HAVE SOUTH SHORE MIDDLE SCHOOL HERE. YOU GUYS STAND UP. AND THEY ARE FORMING OUR HIGH FIVE TUNNEL. OUR AWARD WINNINGS WILL GIVE A HIGH FIVE FROM THE STUDENTS HERE. SO JAKE KICK US OFF. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO HAVE TEAMED UP WITH CODE. ORG TO RECOGNIZE A SCHOOL, DISTRICT, THAT HAS ACHIEVED SOMETHING REMARKABLE. THEY ARE RESEARCHERS, FUNDRAISERS, MENTORS, CHAMPIONS WHO ARE SHAPING THE FUTURE OF CS EDUCATION. I WILL KICKOFF BY ANNOUNCING THE FIRST FOUR WINNER AND HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE. I WILL INVITE THEM TO JOIN ME ON STAGE AFTER I TOLD YOU MORE ABOUT THAT. JOCELYN MORRENSIC, AFTER HEARING ABOUT THE DISTERITY AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY SHE CREATED GOT TECH RICHMOND TO HELP UNDER SERVED SCHOOLS. THROUGH FUNDRAISERS AND CORPORATE DONATIONS, GOT TECH RICHMOND RAISED $40,000 AND DONATED TECHNOLOGY TO EVERY ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL IN RICHMOND. MORE THAN 2,000 STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY DID NOT BEFORE THANKS TO HER WORK. SHE ORGANIZES AND TEACHES DIGITAL ART ADVOCACY CLASSES AND LEARN TO COOK CLASSES. SHE IS HEADING TO COLLEGE AND GOT TECH RICHMOND IS FAR FROM WINDING DOWN. SHE HAS PLANS TO BUILD IT INTO A COLLEGE WORK GROUP WHERE THE WORK CAN CONTINUE TO GROW. ROBERT DEFILLIPPO WORKED WITH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS AND MANY OF HIS STUDENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH COMMUNICATION AND HE FOUND USING CODE. ORG AND FLIP GRID UNLOCKED A FEW FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH THEM. HE HAS FORMULATED A FEW STRATEGY FOR TEACHING KNOWN AS TEAMS, TEACHING ENGAGING ACADEMICS MEANS SPECIAL. THIS WAS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR HIS AUTISTIC STUDENTS. WHEN CHANEL WHITE STARTED AN AFTER SCHOOL CODING CLUB SHE HAD NO IDEA HOW POPULAR IT WOULD BECOME. WITHIN MONTHS IT INCREASED FROM A HANDFUL OF DEDICATED STUDENTS TO MORE THAN 50. WHITE TEACHERS IN TEXAS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF HER STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME AND NONE OF HER STUDENTS HAD BEEN IN A CS CLASS BEFORE AND HER PROGRAM HAS GROWN FROM AN AFTER SCHOOL TO A CLASS TO AN ENTIRE COMPUTER SCIENCE LAB AND SCIENCE EXPO. WHITE BECAME CERTIFIED IN CS TO SHARE HER KNOWLEDGE WITH OTHER TEACHES AND STUDENTS. SEASIDE HIGH SCHOOL CONCEIVED OF HIS VISION FOR CS EDUCATION. AT THE TIME A NEARBY UNIVERSITY WAS OFFERING SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. SEASIDE NOTICED NONE OF THEIR STUDENTS WERE GOING INTO THIS PROGRAM SO THEY SET OUT TO CHANGE THAT. TODAY SEASIDE HIGH SCHOOL HAS 6135 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CLASS CHARACTERIZE REFLECT THE STUDENT POPULATION, 70% ARE HISPANIC AND 11% ARE BLACK AND 74% QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED MEALS. SEASIDE HOPES TO PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL COLLEGE TO IMPLEMENT A CO ENROLLMENT PROGRAM. PLEASE JOIN ME ON STAGE AND LET'S GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE AND HIGH FIVES FOR THIS GROUP. LET'S GIVE A GOOD ROUND OF VIRTUAL HIGH FIVES TO JOCELYN WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BUT IS TUNING INTO THE LIVE STREAM. THANK YOU, JAKE. I WILL READ HIGH FIVE TUNNEL COME BACK. WE HAVE MORE WINNERS. WE HAVE TWO MORE ROUNDS OF WINNERS. I WILL READ MORE AND MELINDA WILL READ ONE LAST ONE. I WILL ANNOUNCE THE DISTRICT AND ORGANIZATION WINNERS. SO THERE IS TWO MORE I WILL ANNOUNCE AND HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE. THE FIRST IS LINCOLN PUBLIC SCHOOL. THEY HAVE A GOAL OF 5050 BY 2020 MEANING CS CLASSES SHOULD BE COMPRISED OF AN EVEN SPLIT BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS. TEACHERS DISCUSS GOALS AND GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO RECRUIT STUDENTS TO THEIR COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES INCLUDING BRINGING IN GUEST SPEAKER AND FREQUENTLY DISCUSSING FAMOUS PEOPLE AND WOMEN IN CS AND ONE TEACHER HAND WROTE 50 LETTERS INDIVIDUALLY TO THE GIRLS SHE THOUGHT SHOULD TAKE HER CLASS. SO LINCOLN WILL COME ON STAGE. THE OTHER GROUP IS GIRLS COTING WITH GIRLS CODING WITH GIRLS. WHEN ADESOLA SANUSI AND HER MENTOR DEVELOPED A PLAN, THIS PROGRAM WAS SO SUCCESSFUL AFTER SANUSI GRADUATED IT CONTINUED. FOR FIVE YEARS STUDENTS HAVE GROWN AND GONE ON TO BECOME MENTORS AND THEY HAVE 250 PARTICIPANTS. THE CLUB HOPES TO CONTINUE TO INSPIRE GIRLS TO GET INVOLVED IN CS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THEIR OUTREACH TO ELEMENTARY STUDENTS. CAN KENT STEEN FROM LINCOLN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ADESOLA JOIN ME ON STAGE AND CAN Y'ALL JOIN ME IN GIVING A ROUND OF APPLAUSE? NOW WE SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST. MELINDA WILL ANNOUNCE THE AWARDS FOR A VERY SPECIAL AWARD. THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIFETIME LEFT SO WE WILL CALL THIS THE EXPANDING CS OPPORTUNITIES AWARD. IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO ANNOUNCE THIS AWARD. THE COMPUTER SCIENCE EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES AWARD. I AM SO PLEASED TO GIVE THIS AWARD TODAY BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT THE BEGINNING OF COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK BUT IT IS INTERNATIONAL PERSON'S DISABILITY DAY AND I THINK THESE TWO IDEAS COMING TOGETHER IS WHAT THIS AWARD IS ALL ABOUT. RICHARD LADNER AND ANDREA STEFIK PARTNERED TOGETHER TO CREATE ACCESS FOR ALL AND THEIR GOAL WAS TO CREATE ONLINE COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS WHO WERE HELPING STUDENTS WHO HAD DISABILITIES. WHEN ANDREAS LOOKED IN THE MARKET HE AND HIS WIFE SAW THERE WAS NOT MUCH THERE TERMS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, VISUAL OR HEARING DISABILITIES AND THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO THEY STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED QUORUM, IT WAS BORN ACCESSIBLE WHICH I THINK IS REALLY NEAT. THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PRIMARY DESIGN GOAL WHEN IT CAME OUT IN 2009. THEY HAVE TAKEN IT SO MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT. THIS AWARD IS GOING TO RICHARD AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW NINE PEOPLE STRONG, THEY ARE ON VERSION SIX, AND IT IS BEING USED FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF PURPOSES, 300,000 PROGRAMS HAVE NOW BEEN WRITTEN ON QUORUM. RICHARD, STEFIK AND THE QUORUM TEAM, WILL YOU PLEASE JOIN ME ON STAGE. WOW. WE ARE ALL INSPIRED BY THESE WINNERS. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THE AWARDS AND THANK YOU TO THE HIGH FIVE TUNNEL. I WANT TO LOOK AT THE MOMENTUM GOING FORWARD. THIS YEAR WE HAD OVER 30 STATES PASS MORE THAN 60 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO A 2019 WE ALREADY HAD FIVE GOVERNORS PLEDGE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE. BY VIDEO I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON WHO WILL MAKE A SPECIAL PLEDGE TO KICK US OFF. HOLA, HOWDY AND HI. I'M THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND TODAY I AM EXCITED TO KICKOFF COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK. I MADE COMPUTER SCIENCE A PRIORITY SINCE I HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR AND I BELIEVE EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THIS 21ST CENTURY SUBJECT SO THIS YEAR I AM CALLING ON EVERY STUDENT IN OUR STATE TO TRY COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPLETE ONE HOUR OF CODE. THAT'S OVER 1 MILLION HOURS OF CODING. AND AS THE COACHER OF THE GOVERNORS FOR K12 COMPUTER SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THE PLEDGES FROM OTHER GOVERNORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THEY COMMIT TO EXPANDING COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS. LET'S GO CODE. STARTING WITHOUT THE GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA WHO PLEDGED THE STATE OF ALABAMA WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ENABLE EVERY PUBLIC TOMORROW IN ALABAMA TO OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE BY 2022. IN MISSOURI GOVERNOR PARSON PLEDGES THE JOIN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO TEACHERS AND UPDATING TECHNOLOGY. FINALLY GOVERNOR BULLUCS OF MONTANA WILL INVEST $250,000 IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. TO FINISH THE PLEDGES OFF I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE ASA HUTCHINSON, THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. GOOD MORNING. I AM THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. WE HAVE SEEN TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THE ARKANSAS COMPUTER SCIENCE INITIATIVE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ANTHONY OWA AND OUR EDUCATORS ARKANSAS HAS LEAD THE NATION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. WHEN I SIGNED THE LAW THAT REQUIRES ALL HIGH SCHOOLS TO OFFER COURSES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE ENROLLMENT HAS GROWN BY 620%. OF NUMBER OF GIRLS TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE HAS INCREASE BY 1,100%. MY SUPPORT OF THAT INITIATIVE HAS INCLUDED AN ALLOCATION OF $800,000 FOR THE KEIGHT COMPUTER SCIENCE LEAD TEACHER PROGRAM TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. WE ARE ALLOCATING ANOTHER 200,000DOLLARS TO THE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES TEACHERS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO TRAIN FOR THIS IMPORTANT FIELD. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS CO CHAIR OF GOVERNORS FOR CS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INITIATIVES THAT ELEVATE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION ACROSS THE NATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE PLEDGES FROM ACROSS THE WORLD FROM COUNTRIES, DISTRICTS AND ORGANIZATIONS TAKING STEPS PART OF COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK TO EXPAND CS. THE PLEDGES HAVE AN IMPACT ON ALL OF US BUT THE PEOPLE THEY IMPAICT THE MOST ARE THE STUDENTS IMPACT THE MOST ARE THE STUDENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THREE STUDENTS, JOIN ME CHUKUNDI MARTIN SALISBURY, JUNIOR. COME ON UP. CHUKUNDI IS IT A SEVENTH GRADER. COME ON UP FROM SOUTH SHORE MIDDLE SCHOOL WHO HAS HIS OWN CHEERING SECTION. HE IS TAKING CODE. ORG'S COMPUTER SCIENCE DISCOVERY CLASS THIS YEAR AND I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE KAI. HE IS SENIOR AT LYNNWOOD HIGH SCHOOL AS PART OF THE AMAZON TEACHER ENGINEER PROGRAM TO INSPIRE, EDUCATION AND TRAIN STUDENTS TO PURSUE CAREERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THEY WORK WITH UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS AND LASTLY WE HAVE CARA WHO IS A 16YEAROLD STUDENT IN MANSON HIGH SCHOOL IN EASTERN WASHINGTON PART OF THE TEALS CS COURSE. MICROSOFT AND THE TEALS PROGRAM HELP SCHOOLS GROW AND SUSSTAIN COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMS. KIA YOU WANT TO KAI, YOU WANT TO KICK US OFF? MORE THAN 80 SCHOOL DISTRICTS MADE PLEDGES TO EXPAND COMPUTER SCIENCE. FIRST, NEW YORK. THEY PLEDGED TO PROVIDE EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT A CS EDUCATION BY 2025. DETROIT PLEDGES TO HAVE COMPUTER SCIENCE IN 100% OF HIGH SCHOOLS BINE 2019 AND ALL THIRD THROUGH FIVE GRADE CLASSROOMS BY 2021. IT'S NOT JUST THE BIG DISTRICTS, FOR EXAMPLE, YUKON KOYUKUK IN ALASKA SERVING ONLY 1400 FULLTIME STUDENTS, THEY PLEDGED TO IMPLEMENT A NEW COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM IN WHICH ALL 10 OF ITS VILLAGE SCHOOLS WILL HAVE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. THESE 82 DISTRICTS WILL REACH MORE THAN 3,000 SCHOOLS AND 2 MILLION STUDENTS. THAT'S A TON OF STUDENTS. I AM GLAD FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I'M GRATEFUL TO EVERYONE THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF US STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT COMPUTER SCIENCE IS AND HOW TO CODE, AND JUST FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO LEARN THESE PRINCIPALS AND CAN YOU JOIN ME IN GIVING A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS? HELLO. IT'S NOT JUST SCHOOL DISTRICTS, MORE THAN 60 NONPROFIT COMPANIES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE ALSO PLEDGING TO HELP EXPAND COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. I WILL SHARE A COUPLE. MICRO BIT AND CODE VA ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO BRING PHYSICAL COMPUTER TO AREAS IN THE VIRGINIA COUNTRY SIDE BY TRAINING 100 TEACHERS IMPACTING AN ESTIMATED 7,000 STUDENTS BY THE SPRING 2020. AND A PLUS COLLEGE READY PLEDGES THAT IN 2019 THEY WILL SPEND $200,000 AND PREPARE 540 K12 TEACHERS AND 20 SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE CS PROGRAMS IN ALABAMA. 24,000 TEACHERS PLEDGE TO BRING CS TO THEIR SCHOOLS THIS YEAR. CAN I GET ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE? > HI. THIS IS A GLOBAL MOVEMENT. TODAY WE HAVE PLEDGES FROM 20 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THEM ALL BUT IN SLOVAKIA ORGANIZATIONS PLEDGE TO ORGANA TRAININGS IN 40 CITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EQUIPPING 400 TEACHERS WITH KNOWLEDGE TO TEACH CS FUNDAMENTAL COURSES. IN ITALY THEY PLEDGE TO DEVELOP CS EDUCATION INITIATIVES IN MORE THAN 80% OF ITALIAN SCHOOLS. IN GHANA THEY WILL PREPARE 300 TEACHERS TO TEACH CODING TO JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS AND THEY WILL REACH 43,000 ELEMENTARY STUDENTS. IN TOTAL AT LEAST 5,750 TEACHERS WILL BE PREPARED TO TEACH CS TO REACH MORE THAN 400,000 STUDENTS. CAN WE GET ONE MORE HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS? THANK YOU, YOU GUYS DID AWESOME. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, GUYS. WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO READ ALL 200 PLEDGES TODAY BUT THEY ARE ON OUR BLOG SO YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THEM. I KNOW THERE IS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO MADE PLEDGES SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS OR IF YOUR ORGANIZATION MADE ANOTHER PLEDGE TO SUPPORT COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION CAN YOU PLEASE STAND UP? THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY MAKING PLEDGES AND TO EVERYBODY JOINING US ON THE LIVE STREAM WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. IT'S AN AMAZING MOVEMENT IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. TO END TO CELEBRATION IT IS MY PRESSURE TO INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICE OF MICROSOFT, BRAD SMITH. HE MANAGES THE CORPORATE WORK FOR MICROSOFT AND IS A VOCAL ADVOCATE FOR PRO BONO INITIATIVES. HE CHAIRS THE BOARD FOR THE LEADERSHIP COUNSEL ON LEGAL DIVERSITY AND THE NEED OF DEFENSE AND THE WASHINGTON STATE OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AND HE AND MICROSOFT HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN SUPPORTING CS EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS OF ALL AGES. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING BRAD SMITH. GOOD MORNING. IT'S A PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF MICROSOFT BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT EVENT AND THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL WEEK. SO MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FOR SO MANY YEARS AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT AND DO ASK SOMETHING THAT REALLY MATTERS AND CONNECTS THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AND THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE WHAT WE ALL SEE EVERYDAY, THE WORLD IS CHANGING. ALREADY HALF OF THE JOBS THE UNITED STATES REQUIRE THAT SOMEONE GO TO WORK POSSESSING DIGITAL SKILLS. AND THAT NUMBER WILL GROW. IT WILL HIT 77% IN THE NEXT DECADE. AND YET WE ALSO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE. MOST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE THOSE DIGITAL SKILLS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING COMPUTER SCIENCE. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS MOVEMENT THAT WE ARE NOW PART OF AS PART OF THE HOUR OF CODE AND CODE. ORG STARTED JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN YOU REACH THE FIVE YEAR MILESTONE LIKE WE HAVE TODAY, I THINK IT INVOLVES AN OPPORTUNITY, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO STEP BACK AND LOOK BACK BUT ALSO LOOK FORWARD. I REMEMBER FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE HOUR OF CODE WAS JUST A TWINKLE IN THE EYE OF HADI PARTOVI. I KNOW BECAUSE AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW HADI'S HOUSE IS NEXT DOOR TO MY HOUSE. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL WE SHARE A COMMON DRIVEWAY. I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE INTO THE GARAGE AT NIGHT IF HE IS STANDING IN THE WAY. WELL, ACTUALLY I CAN BUT RUNNING HIM OVER IS NOT THE RIGHT PATH. I REMEMBER FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS OUT IN HIS DRIVEWAY AND HE SAID I HAVE AN IDEA. THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WE CAN HELP SOLVE. BECAUSE FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE THEY LOOK AT THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND THEY DON'T APPRECIATE ANYBODY CAN ASPIRE TO BE THE NEXT MELINDA GATES OR THE NEXT JEFF BEZOS OR MARK ZUCKERBURG. WHAT THEY DESERVE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THIS FUNDAMENTAL FIELD AND IT WAS HADI'S GENIUS THAT SAID HERE IS A NEW PATH AND AT THAT TIME FIVE YEARS AGO THERE WERE ONLY NINE STATES OUT OF 50 THAT EVEN ALLOWED A STUDENT WHO TOOK COMPUTER SCIENCE TO HAVE THAT COURSE COUNT TOWARDS THE MATH OR SCIENCE GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. ONLY NINE STATES. AND SO HERE WE ARE, FIVE YEARS LATER, AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE. THAT NUMBER OF NINE STATES HAS GROWN TO 44. JUST IN THE LAST YEAR, 33 STATES HAVE PASSED NEW TYPES OF LAWS TO ADVANCE COMPUTER SCIENCE. NOT JUST MAKING IT COUNT, BUT 19 OF THOSE STATES HAVE PUT NEW FUNDING COMMITMENTS BEHIND THEM. YOU SAW IT HERE, WHETHER ITS ALABAMA OR ARKANSAS OR MISSOURI OR MONTANA OR WASHINGTON, THIS HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S A GREAT THING. BUT THIS MOVEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS. THE FIRST HAS BEEN GETTING PARENTS EXCITED. WHICH ACTUALLY PROVED TO BE RELATIVELY EASY. PARENTS GETS IT. EVERY SURVEY SHOWS 90% OF PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE. OF COURSE IT HAS TO MOVE FROM PARENTS INTO THE SCHOOLS AND THAT REQUIRES NOT JUST THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE SUPPORT OF GOVERNORS, IT REALLY CALLS ON THE PEOPLE WHO MATTER MOST WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. TEACHERS. AND THAT'S WHERE TEACHERS HAVE STEPPED FORWARD ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. THEY HAVE VOLUNTEERED THEIR TIME, THEY HAVE TAKEN ON THE NEED TO LEARN NEW SKILLS. THERE ARE 87,000 TEACHERS THAT HAVE WORKED WITH CODE. ORG OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT IS HOW YOU BUILD A MOVEMENT THAT YOU CAN SUSSTAIN. AND OF COURSE ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT STUDENTS THEMSELVES AND IN THE WORLD OF CHANGE CODE. ORG IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN. WHEN YOU CONSIDER OVER 650 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THE HOUR OF CODE, THAT IS SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY AND WE ARE VERY PROUD AT MICROSOFT THAT WE JUST PASSED THE POINT WHERE 100 MILLION OF THOSE STUDENTS TOOK THE HOUR OF CODE SESSION ON MINE CRAFT, ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE ARE EXCITED. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, ALL OF US HAVE, BY WORKING TOGETHER. I THINK WE FIRST HAD TO LEARN HOW TO REACH PEOPLE, HOW TO TRAIN TEACHES, HOW TO TRAIN TEACHERS AT A LOWER COST AND A FACTOR REACH. WE HAVE FATHER REACH. WE ALSO LEARNED THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT NUMBERS BUT IT'S ABOUT DIVERSITY BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS FUTURE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THESE JOBS THAT INVOLVE DIGITAL SKILLS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET FILLED IF THERE ARE PEOPLE TRAINED TO FILL THEM, THEY PAY BETTER. AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THOSE JOBS ARE JOBS THAT CAN BE PURSUED BY EVERYBODY. THAT'S WHY IT SO IMPORTANT ASTHMA LINDA WAS SAYING AS MELINDA WAS SAYING WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO DO THAT. IT TAKES A VILLAGE OF DIFFERENT NONPROFIT GROUPS AND WE AT MICROSOFT ARE EXCITED BY THE RANGE OF NONPROFIT GROUPS WE SUPPORT LIKE GIRLS WHO CODE AND DIGI GIRLS AND BLACK GIRL CODES AND TECH CHICA AND OTHERS. THEY ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT. THE OTHER THING WE LEARN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DIVERSITY, WHEN WE REACH GIRLS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IS THERE IS NO ORGANIZATION THAT WILL REACH MORE DIVERSE PEOPLE THAN CODE. ORG BECAUSE CODE. ORG FOCUSES ON DIVERSITY AT A SCALE THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMAGINE. 15 MILLION GIRLS ARE INVOLVED IN CODE. ORG RELATED COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES THIS YEAR, THIS WEEK IN K12 CLASSES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THE VILLAGE NEEDS TO EXTEND BEYOND THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY TO THE TECH SECTOR AS WELL. THERE IS SO MANY DAYS WHEN PEOPLE GUT UP THE MORN GET UP IN THE MORNING AND THEY COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THIS EFFORT IS THAT IT BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER, WHETHER ITS AMAZON AND MICROSOFT OR GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK WE ALL SIT AROUND THE TABLE TOGETHER. WE DONATE MONEY TOGETHER AND WE WORK TODAY AND WITH HADI AND OTHER GROUPS AND THAT IS WHAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE FOR US TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS WORK WILL TAKE MORE THAN ANOTHER FIVE YEARS, IT MAY TAKE ANOTHER DECADE AND IN SOME COUNTRIES IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN THAT BUT THE FUTURE COURSE IS CLEAR AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH, WE MASTERSERED SO MANY TECHNIQUES, NOW WE NEED TO KEEP DOING IT AND EXPANDING FARTHER EACH AND EVERY YEAR. FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HADI WAS STANDING IN OUR DRIVEWAY I AGREED TOGETHER WITH OTHERS MICROSOFT WOULD BECOME THE FIRST FUNDER AND ONE OF THE FIRST FOUNDERS OF CODE. ORG. SO IN THE BASIS OF THAT WE COMMITTED $25 MILLION. WE GOT INVOLVED. WE CONNECTED CODE. ORG WITH OTHER EXCITING WORK WE DO. BUT WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZED THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO FOR FIVE YEARS AND SIMPLY STOP. IN FACT NOW IS A MORE EXCITING TIME THAN EVER BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT THE CHALLENGES REMAIN AND THIS MORNING WE HAVE BEEN EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE WE ARE PUTTING ANOTHER $10 MILLION INTO THE FUEL TANK OF CODE. ORG. THAT'S EXCITING BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE MONEY TO DO THIS WORK. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS FOR EVERY PERSON WHO WORKS FOR CODE. ORG AND FOR EVERYBODY WHO WORKS AT A TECH COMPANY, FOR EVERYBODY LIKE MELINDA WHO LEADS OR WORKS AT AN IMPORTANT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION, WE WILL NEED TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE IS WE ARE NOT THE ONES MATTER IS, WE ARE NOT THE ONES WHO WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT, IT'S THE TEACHERS OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD THAT WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE STUDENTS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE TEACHERS. SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO SAY THE TEACHERS OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD CAN COUNT ON OUR SUPPORT BUT WE IN TURN ARE LOOKING TO YOU AND TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TAKEN US FORWARD IN THE PAST, THEY ARE THE UNWITHS WHO WILL TAKE US FORWARD AGAIN AND WITH THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WILL TAKE US FORWARD AGAIN AND WITH TEACHER AFTER TEACHER, SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL AND STATE AFTER STATE AND COUNTRY AFTER TOGETHER WE WILL CREATE THE FOUNDATION THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEOPLE DESERVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, BRAD. AND I WANT TO ONE LAST TIME BEFORE WE END, THANK ALL OF THE DONORS WHO MADE THIS POSSIBLE.
