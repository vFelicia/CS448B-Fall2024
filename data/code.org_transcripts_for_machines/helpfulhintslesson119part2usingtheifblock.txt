as you can see i've already coded the program to move forward to the end of the path once we're there we need to figure out how to tell if there's a flower or a honeycomb for that we're going to use the if block if it flower you'll do what's in this top spot what should that be that's right get nectar but if you're not at a flower that means you're at a honeycomb so what should you do that's right make honey now you've got the perfect solution no matter what is hidden in the clouds happy coding
