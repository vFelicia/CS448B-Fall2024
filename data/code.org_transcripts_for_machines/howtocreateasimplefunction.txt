You've already learned to use and edit functions as a part of an efficient program. Now, let's learn how to create and use a function from scratch. To do this, look for the category called functions in the toolbox. Here, you'll see a block called "do something". Drag that block out into your workspace and rename it to something new that better describes what your function will do. I'm calling this one "make a square". From here, you can drag blocks into the function to specify what you want to happen when the function is used. With our function created, you can see that a new make a square block appears under the functions label in the toolbox, so that we can actually use, or "call", our created function from our program. This is an important step that's easy to forget. Okay, time to continue on and get creative with your own functions!
