how did you get so interested to make a whole company um that's a great question and it's so great to see the classroom from Maine in elementary school hi everybody so how did I decide to start a company at code.org didn't start out as a big sort of effort to start a company add it started out really just as a hobby frankly I just thought people should learn computer science and this is something that should be done in every school but before making into a company I decided I'd just like a video and say this is important and that video ended up being very very popular at at least for somebody who had never done some type this before that video got seen by 13 million people and 10,000 teachers said we want this in our classrooms and at the time I didn't have a company I just had a video but once 10,000 teachers wanted it that really is what inspired me to start what really is today's code or I've decided if 10,000 teachers want this in their classrooms somebody should spend the time to make the right courses and to help bring something to the teachers so the teachers who decided to to bring computer sizes their classrooms was really what inspired me to start code argh all right Kim do can you ask a question from your classroom yes hi hi no mirrors gone okay so your name hello I'm normal hi MA okay I'm in fourth grade what state to relive it then i live in the united states specifically new jersey okay my mom which of the puzzles are you most proud of um you know we've made so many different tutorials and activities at code.org is it's hard to pick which ones are my favorites I was awesome to that are really like David's one is the Star Wars tutorial that we released last year that the reason I like that so much as the star wars was one of my favorite things growing up and actually when I was growing up I didn't have access to watch the movies because western movies weren't even available where I was living in Middle East but I i had read books about the movies and i was so excited when i came to america to actually watch these movies that I'd read about and so now 30 years later getting a chance to build a tutorial with the team that made Star Wars to you know drive around r2d2 with the code you wrote was one of my favorite things to make and it's really fun to play my second other really favorite thing we've built is a tool called apt lab and that's designed for slightly older kids who've already started learning some coding all but if you get good from doing the iris code i highly recommend checking out applab it let's see Miss relapse and put on your phone and make all sorts of things with its pad so it's not really a puzzle or that doesn't feel as much like a game it's like the course but it's really shows off with optical coating and being able to make whatever you want to make all right add next classroom and can you unmute yourself yes and by the way I want to apologize to the folks streaming on youtube I had a little bit of trouble starting the broadcaster's now about 50 different classrooms that are watching us but they can't ask questions at so thank you for for bearing with me patiently while we got this started all right go ahead hi I'm Audrey and I'm from his manifest classroom and from elementary school and we were wondering if you were familiar with Ada Lovelace yes I am familiar with Ada Lovelace and there's a really interesting story about this M Ada Lovelace is one of the very first computer programmers and what's interesting about her first of all is that for birthdays I think in two days so add I mean she's long past but today we're celebrating the birthday of grace hopper who is one of the most famous computer scientists from the 1940s Ada Lovelace lived in the 1800s and she is one of the first computer programmers wrote a computer program before computers existed and the reason that's relevant is because computers programming and computer science isn't just about making apps and technology is also about problem solving and and AB she was basically creating algorithms and writing code without an actual computer she just had the idea of what a computer could do and she was writing the code for that and she's one of the most famous computer scientists of all time I also personally think it's cool that the first known computer programmer was a woman because as you may or may not know today most computer programmers among adults are men and that's something code.org and the hour of code is totally going to change you know if you look at who's coding in elementary schools it's almost 5050 boys and girls because girls can do it just as well as boys and I hope you decide to go coding beyond just this classroom at when you get older in middle school in high school do you think you would have been drenched do I think what you think you would have been friends with Ada Lovelace I think I would have been friends of Ada Lovelace if I was alive maybe I might have been em or if she was alive right now I definitely would want to be friends with her thank you all right Amy I'm meeting your classroom Amy actually you need to unmute its to ask a question okay my name is Valerie and I'm from Falmouth Elementary School in fifth grade my question is how many hours a day do you code how many hours of day two I code I don't code every day or in ours because you know right now I run a company now that is doing this work so you know the coding that I do is more effectively trying our own tutorials to make sure that they're they're good enough and making sure that they work the way I'd like them to but the actual website we have I'm not the chief coder we actually have a team of people there's actually 25 people at code.org that are either designing curriculum and courses or they're building the website and actually implementing things like that you know the minecraft tutorial it that you may have played or the our apt lab courses or everything else on korg but you know i started coding when i was 10 and I've never stopped so it's one of my favorite things to do but I unfortunate i'll do it all the time I've made a lot of apps with our little applab tool though and I love playing with all the hour of code tutorials I just made it my own he's the minecraft designer recently have you guys tried the new minecraft designer that came out this just as past few weeks my favorite thing about that is that you can change what the different characters can do so you can make sheep and chicken that go chase after zombies so make sure if you try to use that you you use you know one of the best things about coding is that you can change the rules you know in the real world there's all sorts of rules when you're coding you can kind of design whatever you want and make up your own rules and that's part of what we want to do with the minecraft designer which is to let you you know do whatever you want with in Minecraft the Sheep can not have wool you can you know shear the sheep and instead get diamonds out of them and the chickens can lay gold and they're zombies and creepers can attack each other and you can do whatever you want with it thank you Amy alright Justin the ad is your classroom have a question yes yes how do you do on decade okay those are the computers you can see them out there hi dad um sorry guys from we're from stuff sorry I didn't hear what you said oh yes I it should be worse it like it's like on your laptop right so I can hear you now can you just say again where you from sorry we don't okay we're from the South Florida like Broward County the question was about like were there any hiccups in like making code organ the hour of code so big in like you know so the spread of the hour of code has been just beyond my wildest dreams I should first say so you know when it started at the idea we first launched with was basically saying let's see if we can get 10 million students to try an hour of code and that was just a ridiculous goal to upset for an organization that was basically weekly we were five people and said we can get 10 million people to do this and the reason it got so big is just because it's such a good idea and so it's an idea that has been spread because teachers parents celebrities politicians athletes actors tech companies everybody likes the idea and that that alone has make it spread to the point that we started pushing for 10 million we've had at least 100 million students do the hour of code by far the biggest hiccups we've had is making the website be able to handle all the coding that happens in fact this is the first year that the code.org website has had no technical issues with the amount of sort of traffic we get each year the hour of code is bigger than the year before and it's a struggle to estimate how much we're going to need to you know how much how much visitors and how many users we need to be ready for you know it's hard to run a website that has a lot of people visiting it but it's especially hard when they're not just visiting it for to look at one web page what to look at 30 different web pages in a row over the course of an hour you know sort peak moments will have many hundreds of thousands of people on their exact same page using it so we had to do a number of things we had to disable saving your progress if you have a login just so we don't so that piece of our website doesn't need to stay up so if people can see the pages now making that work has been by father to gets hiccup other than that the hour of code is just in fact my job is a dream job getting to come up with this idea that is being used in countries most people have never even heard of and in cities I've never heard of her visited knowing that people everywhere are doing it it's literally the coolest thing in the world to have an idea that you have spread that far and wide and it's become literally part of the education system in so many countries and the really the message from that I'd say is that if you have a good idea it can get really big so I highly urge you to not be not limit your dreams and if you have dreams of doing something big coding in computer science or by far the best way to get something that spreads across the world there's no other field in which you can come up with an idea build something and then three years later see a hundred million people using it and all the largest tech companies started that way you know we're not a billiondollar tech company but we're that one of the largest education companies and we're only three years old and about 60 people and so it's incredible the amount of world change you can have with a small number of people with a good idea but also with computer science thanks for your question take them alright last question Shane do you want to ask can you see you can you see me yes I can see here hi Michael hi I'm Michael here at mira loma middle school I'm an eighth grader in California and my question is do you think mainstreaming coding will affect people's used on computer science yeah computers I just so much more mainstream now than it used to be at you know when I was in school computer science was the geekiest thing in the world you wouldn't want to go around telling anybody that you a lot of code basically you know to be cool you needed to play sports and to just say that you coded was the most uncool thing you could imagine and nobody really wanted to know you know you just it was not the best way to be sort of making friends and being popular these days computer science is quite cool the President of the United States has worn a coat or hat and has written a line of code just that earlier this week that Prime Minister of Canada did it I assume you guys are I hope you guys have seen the video that we launched just a few days ago with people raging from Kobe Bryant to Serena Williams to name our to marcelo sergio ramos draymond Green Carmelo Anthony Alana beard suit to bird all these athletes coding and saying it's important so I'm pretty sure we've made coding in computer science mainstream already at really the one question is can we add can we get the education system to teach it it's now the point that everybody wants this to be taught and everybody wants it to be learned but it's hard to change schools America's schools and the world schools have existed for hundreds of years teaching the same thing but our world has really changed with computers and software and our education system hasn't changed quickly enough that starts with the hour of code but we need schools to be teaching hundreds of hours of code just like they teach math and history and science and that's going to be taking a longer time but I'm sure we can do it um one last question mrs. e from Tolton I guess I didn't call on you and that's a yes thank you so much hello my name is Marcus Moreland I'm from Chicago and this is Gus is Delta Kappa and I was accent ah how old would you you started come at right sort of the curtain hora doridori code that would oh right fortyyearold right now actually I think we're in for the board or a few weeks ago add em code.org started about three years ago so I was add I was between 40 and 41 when I started Korg had code.org seems like a really big thing and it is the fact that you know 100 million students have used our courses had but it's a really young company it's three years old as a company and there's about you know it started out the first hour of code there was only 13 of us and we kicked off this thing that reached 20 million students there's now 60 of us and we do a lot lot more than the hour of code we're training teachers in every major city in the country we're helping changing laws at the state level and we're creating the most popular courses used in computer science worldwide but the whole thing is only three years old and only 60 people have and you know it's it's I guess it's been amazing to have something that reaches that far and wide and I need to get going but i want to say some closing words expressed especially for the Oh somebody just asked me if I could take a YouTube question at so you hold on just one second i'll take one YouTube question when you ask what's the question give me one second to get a question from the YouTube audience all right I have a question from Heather Womack does everything electric have to have code and this is from first and second graders courses for mrs. Womack's classroom and this is from Lago Vista Elementary School in Lago Vista Texas does everything electric have to have code no it doesn't everything electric needs to have electricity so light bulbs don't have code you know fans don't have code today most refrigerators don't have code but really anything that wants to be smart and by when I say smart I mean you give it some information it does something differently depending on the information can become more smart with code so for example light bulbs can become more smart with code so a light bulb can turn on when it knows that there's somebody in the room and it can turn off when there's nobody in the room or a fan can turn on when it knows that you're there and that it's hot out or a refrigerator can tell you when you're out of eggs and that you need to buy more eggs so it's not that everything electric should have code it's more that everything electric can have code and you can make it smarter and have it do more for you all right I'm going to get going I just want to say thank you so much to all of the teachers worldwide and especially in the United States for helping bring the hour of code to so many classrooms it's been an amazing week and also at just the hour of code is just the start we've reached 300 million hours done across the entire globe but we need every school worldwide to teach computer science beyond one hour every one of you doing this as students please make sure to go tell your parents today that you learned some code in class most of your parents never got a chance to do this when they were in school tell them what it's about and ask your school to teach more computer science beyond just one hour thank you so much especially to the teachers give a round of applause to your teachers folks thank you baba
