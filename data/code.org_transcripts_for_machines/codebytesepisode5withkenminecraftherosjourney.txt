hi everybody uh welcome to code bytes um we're really excited to have you all for the last episode of our week our computer science education week um today we're going to be we're working with minecraft to learn some more about coding we're really excited to do that just want to introduce ourselves first and kind of see who all is here so first of all i'm ken you can see our names above our heads i'm a curriculum developer code.org and this is owen and this is oliver and just let's hear a little bit quick from you guys um owen how old are you and what grade are you in i'm in first grade and i'm seven years old awesome and oliver i'm in third grade and i'm i'm in i am eight years old but i'm almost nine awesome and what school do you guys go to glenwood gatosk great and we're joining you guys from you all from lake stevens washington just north a little bit north of seattle so we're really excited to be with you these two are big fans of minecraft so they're going to be a big help in helping us all learn today we're yeah we're really excited to be joined by all of you um this hour of code movement has just recently passed you know one billion hours of code completed um so there's you know lots of people joining as we speak and people across the world in every single country and every single city have been doing hours of code so if you're joining um it's great to have you and so we can see here on the screen where we have people joining with us right now um looks like we have most people joining from the united states we have a few people internationally looks like someone from india maybe someone from venezuela um we're up in like i said in washington we can see quite a few people up there and there's some people looks like from california that's where i'm originally from so welcome to all of you i'm really excited to have you here um and and to get uh to to get going so um we're gonna do three main things today um yes the first thing is that we're gonna learn to code using minecraft and we're gonna solve some puzzles and so the first first part of that is we're gonna solve some puzzles involving um yes a character called the agent and used to explain that a little bit we're going to use loops to help um clear a path using some pressure plates to help us gather items and then the last thing that we'll do to help us get through doors awesome and then the last thing that we'll do is uh look at minecraft education edition which is basically like the real minecraft game but with a few different editions so if you would like to follow along with us at home as we go through we're going to start sharing our screen just a second but if you want to follow along you can go to this address right here it's code.org minecraft and we're going to be working on the hero's journey activity as we go through so if you'd like to join along go ahead or if you can just follow what's going on on the screen that is totally fine so we're gonna start sharing our screen here so we can you can see what we're working on and as we walk you through this and we're actually gonna need your all help right off the start so let me just share to make sure that that's all set so you should all be able to see my screen now and the first thing that we need to do in uh starting our heroes journey is to choose our character so we need to hear from all of you which character should we play as steve or alex so go ahead and type in your vote take another three seconds to type it in three two one and we'll close the poll so owen who is the winner steve okay so we'll pick steve steve again okay so one second over here let me just get that great yeah there you go awesome so you guys before we get going here's our first level so we've picked steve as our character just want to orient you to what we're seeing on our screen here on the left hand side you can see the kind of the gameplay space so this is where you see that our character steve you see the agent and when we start running the code you'll be able to move around so actually oliver can you hit run now and then see where we go we don't get anything i can't break this with my fists i can't just walk through here like i'm a ghost um that's a challenge i can't break anything so i can't and agent did do anything great so how to code him to do something exactly so let's hit reset thanks oliver that's great and then like oliver just said right we need to we need to code the agent to help us out because right now we can't get to the object that we're trying to get to in this level we're trying to get to a chest and it's down in the right hand corner so we're stuck in we've all been stuck in our houses way too much over the last over this pandemic so we need to get out of the house um the middle part right here you can see where there's some blocks you can choose from that's where all the code blocks are here and so far we only have one block and here's the walk space but we cannot drag this block um the orange block yeah when one we cannot drag it around but we can drag around the blue block yeah we can drag around these this great point so there's some blocks that we can drag and there's some that we can't the ones in under where it says blocks in our toolbox those are the ones that we can drag out into our workspace so let's try this oliver let's try to help the agent um step on that pressure plate so we can get to the chest do you think it would help if we did it twice let's try that yeah this one oh then they just trapped me in again so what did you notice last time so that he went right he just walked on the pressure plate and went off the pressure plate like if i was just able to hurry fast enough i would have been able to get out well let's make it so that we can get out no matter what what do you guys think like i can just wait there for hours so i see that he wouldn't so two he'd move on to this right here and that's two spaces so maybe if you take away one then it look yeah now i can go get the chest great so we're off and running we've got we got the agent on the pressure plate that allowed steve to get the chances to move forwards a lot and some levels we might need to use the like what are these other commands that you see now so now we have sunglasses we have a repeat block we have we have a tone right block and all the time and then what we have click the two and see what happens and we click and we know that you get click it if you see an arrow right here then that means if you click it you have multiple options like you can make it do it three times two times what do you think i think we should do two two hold on guys just one second so that ex i'm glad you guys brought that up but that's an example of what in computer science we call a loop so it's called a repeat block here but it's called the loop computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over and over again without getting bored right they didn't get bored they could just get bored from doing it things over and over again and in the earlier minecraft they had to usually a repeat loop to be able to keep chickens moving around the whole world right so they can do that without getting bored so we can we can utilize that power when we write our code but in this time in this case for the agent all right so we can't get to what we need to get without the agent so we need to hit reset and do some coding so let's get started on that oliver i make my buttons so let's say reset he said he said okay and then how we're gonna code the agent to help us get the map so we want to move him right here but like what we saw on the last level when we wanted him to get onto a pressure plate right in front of him we did move forward two times into this kind of area so maybe we should go for two times in this level and it will get us to the pressure plate and then i just want to share the street for no reason i don't know why i just wanted to gather that a little extra on our way into it yeah i wonder if i can yeah anything work so in that case right oliver you brought up that we could have done two move forward blocks kind of like we showed the beginning of the first level but in this case we use the repeat block to make it a little bit easier okay so now same thing here we've got a pressure plates that we need to get to a compass let's do let's get to the pressure put to the compass first and then you can show us your strategy okay so what do you notice that's different about the repeat block this time it is it's on the number four okay so maybe that is our answer we just don't know it let's see maybe let's try and see if we don't have to cheat okay so i can show you my strategy what i'll do i could instead of like having to discount how many i'm putting there i'll just go like this with my character one two three four and then i'll figure out that's four ah if we press one before we put anything we've figured out that that's thing oh really nice strategy owen so you can use your character to help you with the code because you can do a little investigating beforehand that's a great great point hopefully that's helpful to all of you watching should we go get the compass hmm i i see a diamond right here i wonder what happens if you collect are diamonds good in minecraft yes yeah they are good you can make yeah they're all kind of awesome we should probably try to get that then yeah we should probably try and get it so that what that means actually but this pressure plate you we should do is redstone go so maybe on you should maybe follow that led stone yeah so let's see the redstone path okay so now you can see when he is behind the tree oh it's also going under this block it's going here too okay so we need to get to that other pressure plate is that right yes i can't just stand here and then he goes okay he can't collect so we need some help from you all at home right we've written some code where we could get to the compass but we need to get um over to the other pressure points so here on our screen you can see four different options um you can see them on your poll too what should we write as our next bit of code after our first bit that we already have written to help us get over to the diamond uh to the pressure plate that will help us get the diamond all right so if you're voted uh this one takes a little bit more time so we'll give you kind of five more seconds you've got turn right and then move turn left and then move move and then turn left move and then turn right okay hmm okay so it looks like we've got a winner and the winner there's there's two close two very close winners so well maybe we'll try the real winner and then if we can see this happens in second place so the winner was turn right then move forward four times so let's go back to the code oliver yep and you can hear what one second we just closed i think we should close that so it says so we want to do turn right on the right and then move forward four times that's okay you just change that around so that was the winning vote so let's see what happens uhhuh we should probably see okay turn right it was like hmm so where did the where did the agent end up over here instead of over here huh needs to go got it so i noticed that the second so that's totally fine as we tried something right and we figured out if it worked just like we did in the first level so this is what's called debugging right we're gonna figure out a bug in our code what do you the second place option was to change it from turn right to turn left so let's try that i don't even need to pull one over here i can just change that let's try oh oh yes now we get the diamond plus we get to get the compass and then if you get this thing then you complete the level that's how it wait let's see what it says here congratulations you found the diamond path awesome once we get to the end then we can go all the way back and fix all the messups to try and get all the diamonds and all the blows so you're saying if we went back if we had gone past this one we could have come back and come back to the diamond later if we felt like we wanted more of a challenge if we go back to one so let's let people at home do that if they want but we'll keep going on to number four five and six then we've seen the diamond on number three okay so now the diamonds out there so it's going to be hard to resist sometimes yeah sometimes it would like it would pop up character cannot walk over cannot go cannot swim but the agent can hover over okay so the agent has some abilities that we that we as the character don't have right um so great that's good to know so let's do one of these um and what do we need to do we need to get to that uh bucket let's try and bucket this pressure plate okay so we need to get all the way out there i kind of want to get the down again hmm all right so let's see if we can get to let's see first to get that one thing how much blocks were in front of the agent it was seven if you come to the pressure place so i put a repeat loop that's seven times that would repeat it seven times great so now i just need to find out what block is it so my strategy does not work on water you cannot like count with the camera but you can if you press this button we can do the strategy that you said if there was no water but in this case we kind of need to use the mouse to count the number of squares so let's put a move forward block in there and see what happens i cannot do a dance party so if you were part of the dance party episode earlier this week this might look familiar but it's not really going to help us solve our puzzle it's just kind of fun we're trying to dance right now we're trying to walk all right so let's try that again i i have something else this is a dance this is good oliver you i think you could you could become a choreographer with this with choreography uh you know teaching the agent all right so let's reset this clear this code and so good just to remember if you ever need to get rid of code you can just drag it like all others doing it in the trash the tone left or turn right is what we need and we have one more block right so i wonder what would happen if we put something like right here and it's like in the middle of nowhere there's no closure and what would happen like is that gonna work say forgot it starts it starts to have another block inside to walk make sure that oh it does not lock properly inside the container all right so let's just do the basic one here it says unused code thank you guys let's just do this basic one to get through it and then we're going to jump ahead to bubble stick so let's hit reset and run a7 thank you agent needed that bucket yep needed that diamonds well maybe everyone to get home and go back and figure out how to get the diamond when they try it on their own so let's just actually jump ahead to number six oliver okay because in this case it involves water too we need to get across the water so we need to actually build a brick so it's kind of cool to kill to build glitches that's really cool i like it we also let's try and get the diamond in this level i think well so yeah let's go ahead just go ahead and do it over what do you think what we should do first so first we should count what's in front of the agent can we know how much times to make him move forward which is gonna be one two three great so let's do that after that so let's change this to a three what what kind of material are we gonna use at this time and what material are we gonna build it out of sand across planks bridge planks oak ring planks spruce planks great so we need a url's help at home what should we build our bridge out of go ahead and take five seconds to type in your answer i hope she and the winner yeah me too okay what was the winner i use that all the time in minecraft cool a lot and it's kind of the same color you can go and close that that's great yep good job all right so we'll make it out of oakland already on old planes but if we do this nothing's gonna happen yeah what is he doing what is he doing there must be another block we need so sometimes we actually have to put more than one block inside of a repeater we need a full move from one foot what we should do after the split i think we should do it after the build let's okay let's try that okay so please oh enough times i don't want to get a two blocks that's not gonna do all right that's not gonna do it let's try the other one like it was before before you changed it awesome okay so oliver i know you want to get the diamond but we're kind of running long time so we do need to move on so let's just go get there and then we're actually going to switch our screens here for a second so let me just take over for one second hopefully all of you at home either if you're following along now that's great and if you um want to check it out later we'll show you how to do that when you get to the end of this tutorial excuse me um you're going to be you're going to see that there's 12 levels and at the end of the level this is a free play level so me and oliver have done some work these two have made their own free play level but if you notice one second oliver if you notice in the toolbox right um would you show the toolbox they're all over just get rid of that repeat uh just get rid of that repeat um menu just click on the six there you go so you've got a lot more options here right you've got destroying blocks you've got rails um so great point owen says as you go through the rest of the levels you'll see that there's more blocks that get that you get to use and then this is the chance to use them all and there's also some functions you can do and these please control when you want to use the functions if you use a functional stuff so let's just click run and see what you guys have made and then everyone at home we hope you all again we challenge you to see how far you can take your own creativity your own imagination to make your own level i know i'm just writing so what i noticed right is that you actually you can go beyond what's shown the first time right and you can see a lot more cool so we've built some rails all the way to this other house and then he's going back because one time it messed up i hope that's not the house we were stuck in on level one no it's not because this has a garden i don't wanna get stuck in there again so oh cool we've got a rail coming across here it's gonna make a bridge right go oh no awesome right up there not yet so these two are still in process of working on it and they'll continue to work on it again we hope that everyone at home can do the same thing we're going to show you one more thing here so i'm just going to stop that we're going to show you one more thing which is um the like i said the education version of minecraft um and this is something that you can download and use without an account and uh we have to use our account actually tell me well enough not to do these activities right tell me a little bit about what you guys have noticed when you've played this um version so what have you guys noticed about this different kind of things that you can do so what do we do right and so tell us a little bit about this story that we're in so we're trying to make like the illidar town and the villager town being night and help each other and those like different quizzes and the more like levels you complete with code bigger your tree grows and so far we haven't done any levels maybe to the middle of villager town awesome great and so just while you guys go find uh somebody to talk to i'm just gonna explain a little bit this is called the tale of two cities and villages two villages oh you always correct me on that that's what it turns into tale of two villages and this is connects to uh the theme of kind of cs for good which is what like oliver know when we're saying they can help these two villagers have been apart for a long time and they are kind of afraid of each other they don't really know each other because they've just been a par for so long so you with code and using the agent can help kind of uh help the these villagers and these illegibles get to know each other and help each other so let's go talk to the fishermen okay let's oh hi friends fishing is something we've never been good at the aerodromes from next town over offering to help us to learn how but they say we need a doc first great can you help us build a dock at the edge of the show we just need the outline see if you can build it's six blocks long and four blocks wide great so let's click start activity we don't actually have time to do this but can i if you guys just show them the what it looks like to code the agent in uh no no what are we doing you're giving it to him all right can you show what it looks like to code the agent in this setting so let's see now now i have so low so what are some things that are similar to this what we just did and what are some things that are different that they're made of blocks so there's both blocks just like we have before it looks kind of exact same as mine that's the only minecraft i play right and it looks kind of like the minecraft so it's kind of a combination of for all of you played minecraft before and enjoyed it um right there's the there's the game itself but then you can also use the coding skills that you've practiced that we just practiced to help solve these problems so we're going to stop sharing right there okay the last thing i'll say is again here if you want to keep doing all of these activities go to code.org minecraft to check out these activities all the ones that you saw and more today how i find it is just by typing in minecraft coding that's how i type in to find it and share whatever you create with us using these two hashtags hour of code and code bytes and that's our show for today thank you all so much for tuning in we hope you had a great computer science education week and uh should we do our diamonds chat to send this out all right diamonds on three one two three diamonds bye everybody bye you
