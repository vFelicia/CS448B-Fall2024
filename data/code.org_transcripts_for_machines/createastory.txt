So far you've been making an animation or a story that does the exact same thing every time you run it. Now you can make an interactive game that you can actually play. There are some new blocks to try out. There's the "when arrow" block and the "move actor" block. You can put these blocks together to move the actors around with the arrow keys. And there are some blocks that do stuff when actors collide or are clicked. Check them out and have fun!
