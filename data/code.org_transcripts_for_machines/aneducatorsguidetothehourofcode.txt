wonderful well thank you everyone for joining us this evening tonight's webinar is called an Educator's Guide to the hour of code we have over a thousand people registered for the webinar tonight and so far over 200 have dialed into the call um all of you who are joining us this evening have come in automatically into the blue jeans platform on mute so you can see me you can see Laura and Alice you can see our slides but we cannot see and we cannot hear you so by um all means please get comfortable relax we got about an hour to talk about computer science together should be a great evening but just keep in mind that the only way we can communicate with you is through the chat pod which is on the side of your screen it looks somewhat like a little quotation bubble from a comic book so if you have a question a comment feedback or just want to say hello use that chat pod to go ahead and do that throughout the meeting um later on in the meeting we are going to have a Q&A discussion and at that time we will use the chat but we're also going to use the hand feature so on the side of your screen you should also see a little hand icon if you click on that that allows me as the moderator to activate your microphone and webcam for you so that you can interact with us and speak to us and we'll do that about halfway through the meeting um but for now let's just focus on using the chat pod um and I'll let you know when it's time to to raise your hand if you have a question we go to the next slide Laura thank you so um this event and Educators guide to hour of code is the third in a series of monthly webinars we've been hosting this fall here at code.org um previously we had a Q&A with our founder Hadi ptoi and um the last meeting that we had was a a sharing out of our evaluation program results but for the next two meetings that we're going to be having the one tonight and the one on December 2nd we're going to be focusing on the hour of cod so we're really glad that you're here to join us and um hope that you've brought your questions and your comments and your um best practices to share so tonight's presenters are um two of my favorite people at code.org just not just saying that because they're here tonight but it's actually true um Laura Klein is the manager of the hour of code program she's been working on hour of code since the very beginning um and uh has a lot of great insight to share with you I think you guys will love hearing from Laura and then Alice Stein glass is code.org is Vice President of product and marketing um and Alice has just been a really huge influence on hour of code this year I think that um a lot of the stuff she has to share will also be super interesting to you go to the next slide so basically we're going to go through this evening a set of best practices that we've gathered from successful hour of code Educators who we've interacted with throughout the past two or three years um and share with you what we've learned what are these teachers doing that makes hour of code work in their classroom after we share what we've learned we're going to have about 20 or 30 minutes for you to ask us questions and to get the help and support you need to be successful when we get to the question portion of the meeting I'll explain to you how to ask how to ask questions um but during the whole beginning as I mentioned please do feel free to use that chat icon on your side um and we will address questions as we go I heard a little Echo no you heard a siren outside our windows so I heard a siren outside the window the hour of code is on fire people and the fire department all right so I'm gonna hand it over to Laura and Alice um and I will go on mute and um close my webcam also just to say bandwidth ladies if you need me Hing me thank you great well let's get let's Dive Right In and get started I'm Alice and U we're going to go through how to teach the hour of code and a lot of your questions about how to make it successful at this point we've had over 100 million sorry students what's more than that well that's that's out of date um we need to update our slides there's more every day um we've had over a 100 million students across the globe um who have done the hour of code and been exposed to computer science um and right now we have about aund and almost 110,000 Educators who have signed up to organize a hour of code with their classrooms this year so we're really excited about the scope of this um it's really important because for a lot of these students this is their first chance ever seen uh computer science they have no idea what it is um or it's you know an opportunity to do something that they don't normally get to do in their school and so that's something that we really hope with the hour of code it gives them a chance to see what it's about there we go so what we're going to do is we're going to run through the six steps of teaching hour of code um we're going to talk about how you can plan how you can promote your hour of code within your school and outside your school how to prepare for the hour of code and when we do that we're going to go through um how to choose a tutorial how to make sure it's the right tutorial for your class what you need in terms of classroom supplies to make the hour of code successful um then we're going to walk through what you should actually do on the day of the hour of code starting by inspiring your students with video and a quick uh and we'll talk about how to do that um then we'll show you what's going to happen when they're coding and finally um celebrating because you've done it and uh hopefully we'll get all through all of that in the next 20 to 30 minutes and then leave lots of time for your questions afterward um so to kick it off we've got Lura to tell us how to plan our hour of code thank you Alice uh so the first thing to do is think about planning the hour of code is make sure you sign up your event on the hourofcode.com so not only when sign up your event you will be eligible to receive um cool all organizer prizes uh but you also will be added to a map so everyone can see and find you doing the hour of code after you signed up your event you want to start envisioning the experience you want your students to have start to finish you are you doing this in the computer lab are you doing it in the cafeteria are they doing it in groups or are they doing it one on one to one um and and that's uh then the next way to start your hour code after you decide what you want to do tell other teachers to get involved so we have a ton of resources at uh our code.com resources where you can download posters and social media blurs and stats that you can share but also encourage other teachers at your school to do it and you can also encourage uh your whole District to do it so we've heard from so many teachers all over the country that they've been able to sign up their whole District to participate that's especially cool if you're a computer science teacher say and there are a lot of teachers at your school who aren't computer science teachers they might be afraid to do it or afraid to try it and so you know helping other teachers at your school get started um can be a great thing to do and if there's a computer science program at your school with computer science students have them recruit other students to get involved and learn that week too and they can be the experts there uh getting everybody on on board and comfortable okay so at this point you've got your you've got your class or your school everybody's signed up you're ready to go you're in the thing how do you actually prepare for the hour of code and what do you need to do to get ready so let's walk through that the first thing you need to do is pick a tutorial and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to share my screen um and let me go right here share screen uh share okay uh so hopefully this is Melissa's switching over to me so you can see this great um so let Chrome okay so let's look at so here is um the place to go this is linked from hour of code if you click try it it's linked on the main page of code.org if you click try it um or you can just write down the URL here code.org learn um and if you look here what you'll see is all of the tutorials um that we' picked for this year at the top are our two feature tutorials for the year um and these are ones that we just developed for this year this is particularly useful if you did the hour of code last year or if your students did the hour of code last year with another class neither of these tutorials have done yet so you'll know that all the students are seen them for the first time we have two tutorials here one is a Minecraft tutorial the other is a Star Wars tutorial and I'm going to go into those in more depth in a minute um but before I do that a lot of you have been asking about kindergarteners and young kids both of these tutorials are designed for kids ages uh we say roughly six plus um but they should be able to read a little bit um I have tried it we've tested it with kids who were sort of early readers and not you know not strong readers yet and they can kind of get through it on their own if you're if you have a question you know your kids's best so you can try just trying out the tutorial and see if you think it's the right age for them um but if you do have younger kids if you have kindergarteners prereaders I'd recommend looking a little bit lower here um we have these other categories um of tutorials so under tutorials for beginners if I click this right arrow you'll see some other tutorials that are really designed for beginners and for each of these you can see what um you can see what ages we recommend them for so for example this Tinker one is PES 5 through 133 and you can also see what devices it's going to run on so this one runs on Modern web browsers if you look at uh the tutorials that we've created the Minecraft one um and the Star Wars one and some other ones we had last year um those will all run on any device you have on a Mac on a PC on any browser on Chrome on Safari they'll run on iPads they'll run on iPhones they'll run on Android devices Windows devices you name it um some of these other tutorials uh they do have specific U things they're looking for this is scratch it's a fantastic tutorial it's for ages eight plus um but because there's been a bunch of questions about prereaders I'm going to go to um a couple of our prereader ones um where is the what was our top recommended one for prereaders you have it uh the fos is a great one uh for prereaders it's under the apps and devices or I'm sorry under tutorials this is looks like we're Frozen apps screen is frozen up there yeah this one's great for prereaders um so oh my okay so um this was under tutorial apps for phones and tablets um it's called the Foos and it says prereaders welcome we've called it out in the heading because it's really great for prereaders um so if you are one of the people who been asking us about you know I've got younger kids prereaders this would be one that I would recommend trying and the great part about the food is they've uh recently launched a web browser version of this so we actually will be adding it up uh to the beginners uh category so you'll actually don't need uh phones or tablets to do this one at all and it's excellent yeah it's really awesome uh so let me the other questions I had were you know do I need to have experience you know coding you don't need any experience coding you can go into this without any experience but I'm just going to show you what they look like um so I'll start with the Minecraft one and the Star Wars one so if uh let me go to my link here um so when you click on the Minecraft one it opens up this page page um at the top you've got your Minecraft tutorial um and we've created short URLs for all of these so if you just want to write them on the board for your kids to type in um code.org MC will take you to the Minecraft tutorial you can also of course bookmark that on the pages for them to make it even easier especially if you have young kids uh below it we've also linked these inspirational videos and I'm going to talk more about that later but that's a great way to kick off your classes with one of the inspirational videos then once you click try now it will launch you right into the Minecraft tutorial and at this point point it's selfdriven these are designed so that you don't need to be um leading the whole class through it the class can lead themselves through it so as a student I come in I can pick whether I want to be Alex or Steve um I'm gonna pick Alex because I think she is cool and has a ponytails let's select Alex um and it'll walk through each of the instructions so add a second move forward command to reach the sheet um and here I can see and then it'll tell me I need to hit run to try my program um I'm going to go ahead and add that move forward command here right here and the part I skipped here was was also an instructional video that played um I don't want to play that over the blue jeans because it doesn't work well over blue jeans but um if you're if you want to try out the tutorial yourself you'll see that there's an instructional video where um in this case Yen who is the lead developer of Minecraft will walk the students through exactly how to do this and show them what they're doing so just to get them started um I click run and I beat that level and move on to the next one and it builds up very very slowly um deliberately so we introduce one concept at a time that first level all we're doing is introducing how to use the UI and then as I go further it'll introduce more Concepts like now I'm learning that I can um use this destroy block to chop down the tree later we'll teach loops and if statements and a few other Concepts Alice what's a UI oh user interface um so yes we will for us left Tex Sal out there um and and um and as you look at it you know one of the other things we do is we try to if the kids don't get it um there are these hints that will help them out so you know here I did not get it I can click C hint and it'll show me that I might want to try using the destroy block um block so that's something that you know you can you can just let your kids go through this they will do it on their own if they have any questions we encourage them to do something called try three uh sorry ask ask three than me um which is basically ask a friend and that's great for a couple reasons one um it really you know as you all know because your teachers but asking somebody else not only um you know helps me but also helps that student because they have to explain it to me um we also encourage pair programming and that's really great um we found it also helps uh girls be more interested in computer science when they're working with other girls or working with other boys either either one um and so prepare programing you put two people at a computer together and that also gives them somebody else that they can work with and if they get stuck they can ask each other they can ask the person next to them um and that's all a fantastic way to to help them through these tutorials the Minecraft tutorial if you've done our tutorials before is similar to The Angry Birds tutorial the original hour of code tutorial we produced in terms of the kinds of concept it's teaches so at first it's going to teach me how to take a concept like how do I get over to that tree and break it down into a series of steps or um as we go further you know I learn how to build a house um and I I learn how you know in this case the level I just loaded is the is the level for chopping down trees so I start to learn how would I you know walk over to one tree chop it down turn left walk over to another tree and chop it down and how do I um how do I do all of those steps together and how do I put those in sequence and then we teach Loops um and the students learn how to use a loop in a computer to be able to let the computer do many things over and over again um and they use that to do you know big things like build an entire house um and then they learn about if statements at the end it's not important that you're finished students finish the tutorial um and I usually tell them that up front um because sometimes they feel like oh I really have to get to the end they don't it's totally fine um if your students go at different Paces so some students can zip through to the end and if they do there's a free play level at the end um and they can just keep free playing for as long as they want or um I'm G to skip the video right now this is the free play level an extra big level where it's like nine times the size and they can go everywhere and build stuff um or they can go on if you want to let them do a different tutorial they can start another tutorial afterwards and for students who don't finish that's also completely fine so you know having students who get to level seven or level six um that's great and at any point when you're done with your hour they can just go ahead and click straight to I'm finished with my hour of code um and you can do that whether or not you get to the end um and they can still get their certificate and we'll talk a little bit more about um certificates in a minute so um I also want to show you the Star Wars tutorial so uh we have a new tutorial this year for Star Wars and there actually two versions of this tutorial we have a blocks version and a JavaScript version the difficulty of them is almost the same the big difference is you type in the JavaScript version so if you have a group of kids who um are uh can't type yet you should definitely do the blocks version if you have a group of kids who can type and are a little older and maybe feel cooler if they're typing you know like it's it's a real code and it's exciting to type the JavaScript one is great because it gives them the flexibility to use blocks if they're not super comfortable with typing or if you have a mixed class where some want to use blocks and some want to type um but it also gives them the flexibility to turn turn into um to switch over to the to the typing mode so here are the um this is what the block version looks like again so you know here I am on bb8 um and it's very the beginning is very similar I'm you know moving down and around I'm gathering these things using these blocks that are um the block version and then this is the uh JavaScript version um and again it uses blocks that I can drag but instead of being simple English where it says you know move space right it's actually the real Java script command so move right one word with the parentheses and the semicolon at the end and at any point the students can switch into text mode and type something like move left um in you know typing so it feels you know a little bit more like real JavaScript here uh in this tutorial we don't teach we teach a different set of Concepts than in the Minecraft tutorial we instead of teaching loops and if statements we focus on events and you can play through it it's fun they make their own game at the end um and we've had you know my uh my son made a game where there were all these you know Storm Troopers coming after him and then you tried to get these like flying winged things called minox and um and the more you got the more appeared and it's super fun and they can create that um because these tutorials teach different concepts it's also completely fine if a student finishes early to have them do both tutorials like they're designed to be compliments of each other or they can help other students or they can help other students which is also great so um I think that was the whole demo we're going to do right now you can definitely try these out on your own um I just wanted to do a quick demo here so let's go back to our slides oh um okay I need to exit here screen sharing stop screen sharing and we're back to the slides we're doing it okay so once you've picked your tutorial um and you've said you know just try it out see if it seems age appropriate for your kid kids um the next thing to do is try it out on your device you know it should just work but you just want to make sure that you know I don't you know if you if you have iPads in your room if you have Android tablets in your room you want to make sure that the tutorial you picked is compatible with the device you've picked and they should all be listed up front um but for example if you looked at the JavaScript tutorial I just showed you because it involves some typing it wouldn't work on a tablet you would want to use the blocks version if you were on a tablet um it's good to test it out in advance yeah it's good to try it out before you have a whole classroom with 30 students trying it out better to try it out when it's just you um if you um if you don't have enough devices you can use pair programming although I prefer using it even if you do have enough devices I think you know it's just a lot more fun but um definitely if you don't have enough devices you should do it um and if you have low bandwidth you might want to download all of the videos up front and we've got some instructions for how to do that another thing that you can do in advance print out the um the certificates for your class um you can also you know give it to them after the class but um if you go to there's a link in the howto guide where it shows you a link to print out all the certificates and what I've done in the past is just enter all of the students names up front there's a sort of copy and paste all your student names in it'll generate all the certificates for everyone in your class to say they've done an hour of code you can print them all out in advance and then when the class is over you can hand them all their certificates um and the kids really love taking them home and then also their parents can see that the you know sort of an achievement that they did that hour of code um I've also seen teachers hang them up in the classroom as another way to you know celebrate it Cate yeah so now we're ready to actually do the hour of code um and the first thing you want to do when you kick off the hour of code um is just tell the students what they're doing that day um and this doesn't take very long most of it's just putting them in front of the computer and letting them do the hour of code um but what I like to do is you know just five minutes at the beginning um if younger kids gather them on the rug if their older kids leave them in their you know in their seats um and tell them a little bit about what computer science is and play a video to inspire them so kids often have this misperception that computer science is you know something that like a boring old guy does in their basement yeah totally you got it um and they don't see it as something that they can do especially if they're a girl or if they're you know AfricanAmerican Or Hispanic it just doesn't feel like something they would do or it doesn't feel like it applies to their life and today it's something where you know if you make a movie like Anna and Elsa right you use computer science to make the movie you know we use computer science in space in medicine in agriculture in all every basically every field you go into um there ways to connect it to computer science and helping them see that is part of the reason we do the hour of code so they see why hour you know coding is interesting um and so we've created a bunch of videos if you don't know how to like if you don't know much about computer science yourself uh it could be hard to explain all of this so we've created a bunch of videos to make it easy um there are these are all on code.org educate Inspire and um you can just pick any one of these um we the first one on the list if your students have done this before is brand new for this year so if you want one that's brand new they haven't seen before um in particular is about women and girls getting women into computer science so um you know to inspire the girls in your class to see that something that girls can do um and then there's some the rest of these are things that are for everybody um you know and the last one there that we have there is um Barack Obama encouraging the kids to do computer science which can be fun so um you play the video um and then you can do something inspiring or you don't know much about computer science and you want someone to come to your class and help Inspire the class we have thousands of volunteers um who work at tech companies or computer science university students um and they are happy to come to your class and help out with the hour of code um we uh they're all listed here we have this page it's linked on the howto page on the code.org if you want to reach out to one of these people um it's up to you to do the screening that your school requires we have not bedded any of these people um they have just signed up volunteering and saying that they you know they they have links to their Facebook profiles or their LinkedIn profiles um you know they work at tech companies we have not vetted any of that um but I assume most of them are you know real tech people that you could work with um you will need a little time to coordinate with them and most of them have said they would volunteer for one uh hour of code so if you want to reach out to one of these people I'd really encourage you to do it soon so that you can find somebody who's near you um and you can get it set up with enough time to get going before your class starts and even if there isn't somebody near you a lot of them um because you know a lot are based in Seattle because of Microsoft or in the Bay Area because of all the tech startups uh a lot of them will be willing to Skype into the classroom or video chat into the classroom uh to inspire your students as well yeah and that might be easier to set up too because you don't have to go through any like background checks that your school requires or anything else because you could just Skype into them um and they can you know what I would do if you if you connect with one those people is just let them talk for like five to 10 minutes maybe answer some questions from the students about what computer science is and what they do with computer science and then you let your kids code and we already showed that part just put them in front of the computers let them go to the right tutorial and um that should you know you can do it anywhere from 30 minutes if that's what you've got to an hour and they're designed to be flexible in terms of how long it takes and um while they're doing that you know you can have them help each other out you can do it in front of the room you can do it in their own classes um and basically your job is just to be the guide on the side so help them if they have questions um this is a picture this is a way to do pair programming I actually prefer it when you just have one computer and two students actually sharing the same computer I find that that just forces them to talk more if they're on their own computers they may sort of diverge in terms of what they're working on and we have a great video linked from the how to page on what pair programming actually looks like that we made yeah um there's also a number of unplugg lessons so if you don't have computers for your classroom um or your kids are just you know younger um it can be more fun to get them up walking around running around than putting them in front of computers I've done the unplugg lessons with threeyear olds fouryearolds 5year olds um I really I actually I personally like them I like for they really young kids yeah um for the older kids I've also I've done them with third graders and they're fun even with third graders um but if you do have a a young class and you know your class is not the type who you know would sit and read a book for a long time they like want to get up and run um this is a really fun way to do a computer science activi it's interactive and they can work with each other there's a whole series of these on the list of tutorials and you can find one that's great for your class and take pictures after everybody's excitement in the moment uh and also you can invite uh politicians uh local tech industry people all to come and try the hour of code with you yeah that's really the politicians a lot of them love the opportunity to do this this is a great opportunity for them um and it's also really cool for your school to get to see like the governor or the mayor or you know some local politician coming and joining them for this or you can even have them teach the principal how to code yeah nice um so after they do their hour of code you want to celebrate their big accomplishment and achievement so like Alice said you can go to code.org certificates and prepopulate all your students names uh that way you can give them uh certificates at the end and we see these pictures all come in through our social media uh throughout the week and we love love love seeing them um our developers who have worked so hard on the tutorials love to see how excited and happy students are uh doing that these are just more pictures of student of uh that have been shared with us and if you U hashtag it hour of code and do code.org we're guaranteed to see it we've also seen teachers build a wall of Honor with all the certificates so most importantly as you're doing the hour of code show us your hour code share us what you're doing uh your stories maybe you have something new that we haven't talked about today we want to know about it so we can tell teachers next year um so just hasht it hourofcode code.org it's also really helps encourage other teachers at your school when they see you do it um it's a great you know some people who might not thought they could try it might try it because you did it and it worked with their class your class so that's it six easy steps yeah we're right on time we said we f Mission what time is it 25 minutes um so lots of time for your questions you guys did great you blasted through it and as a matter of fact I think one of the most common questions I got was is this session being recorded yes it is ladies and gentlemen if you registered for the event you will get a link to this recording so don't panic if you didn't catch everything that Alice and Laura covered uh in that lightning round so much great information ladies thank you so much um the other thing that we're going to do after the event is over um when we email you that link to the recording we're also going to email you a link to these slides and these best practices so don't feel like you need to take notes on everything apologize should just said that in advance um so we did have a request for a demo um and then there's a couple other questions so I'll tell you what we would like demoed and then you guys can answer a few other quick ones in the meantime um some folks were asking if they want to track student progress um for hour of code what do they need to do um Kate and I were talking about um how it needs to be a code datw work tutorial and you would need to create a code Studio account is that something that we could show on the screen maybe for folks who are struggling yeah absolutely definitely I'm gonna start sharing that why don't you ask another question and Laura will answer it while I get that set up sure so one of the first questions that we got was you know how is a teacher how can a teacher best decide which tutorial to use in their classroom um are some more appropriate for other for ages than others um what if some students have more experience coding than others what what do we recommend for teachers as they're trying to figure figure out which tutorial is for them so definitely it comes down uh to to age uh and experience if your students um aren't readers you definitely want to do something like Foos or Hopscotch or codable or are they offline are they unplugged unug we have mentioned that earlier yeah the unplugged are great yeah um and then there's also if your students are more in high school and want to feel more adult like they're really writing code our Star Wars tutorial is great because they can do the JavaScript version of it and we have a whole series of JavaScript tutorials from code HS code academy Con Academy those are all better for uh older students or more advanced students uh the beginner tutorials are pretty much great for anybody to start I mean my mom did The Angry Birds tutorial and loved it yeah she's like 60 um yeah and you know for older students um I think KH Academy has got a great tutorial if you're in high school and you're you know want to do less something a little more more advanced um why don't we we'll come back to that again let's go I've got this up on the screen sharing so I don't want people to just stare at my screen um without having somebody talking so um let me talk a little bit about the question about student accounts in progress so um the first thing to mention is that we okay so here I'm GNA show this up here um so we've designed it so that you don't need to create any um you don't need to create an account the students don't need to create an account you can monitor their progress and to see what they're up to um without any accounts just by walking around the room and so if you look up here I'm going to go so you can see just at a glance at the very top of the screen you can see I'm on puzzle one um and we actually put that on the top of the screen deliberately so that when you're just walking around you're sort of looking over the kids heads you can easily see where every student is um in the class so let me I'm just gonna finish this one level I'm G to go move right again and hit run go P okay I did it I moved on to puzzle two um and what you see here is I've got a Green Dot right here showing that I finished level one um and you see the big number two so I can tell that I'm on puzzle two um this is really helpful as you walk around the room because I can see at a glance you know this kid's on puzzle two this student's on puzzle seven I can sort of see who's falling behind who's ahead um I don't have to log in I don't have to go to any Dash boards I don't have to look at anything live real time in the room as you're doing it if you see a student who's really struggling or falling behind you might ask another student to help them or you might help them um try to catch up a little bit um or just see you know why they're stuck the other thing you can see is if a student skips and this happens you guys all have students you know what this looks like so this kid saw that his friend was on level seven and level seven looked like a lot of fun um and so he just decided to skip right straight to level seven so now when I look over this kid's shoulder I see that they finished level one because it's green there was a whole pile of white dots that they did not do and they went right to level seven um and so that also gives me like you know indication of what's going on and I can see all that progress so that's actually what I recommend doing real time in the classroom um for just the hour of code um there's no reason to set up an account there's no reason to set up student accounts um this just makes it really easy to just you just put the kids on the URL and watch it and it's great now if you do want to go a little further if you're thinking about more classes or if you just want to have a record for later to look at to see what the students do you can create an and to do that what you want to do um is in this upper right if I wasn't logged in um which I just did so I'm G to sign out again for a minute just so you can see this um so when you come to our um site on any of the pages you'll see the signin button on the top right um so go ahead and click that and if you can either um sign in or if you haven't signed up yet you can click sign up to create an account um I actually have an account so I'm going to go ahead and enter it here I have have many many accounts this is my teacher account um and this op stuff you won't see because that's just because I'm uh I work here so I see that stuff um so over here on teacher homepage um on your teacher homepage which is where you'll go straight when you log it's the first place you're going to see when you log in on the top left there's a student accounts and progress box uh and if I click there um what I can do is I can set up a section um so let's set up a new section um let's call it um period one I already have period one on here um what should I call it Laura coding is fun coding is fun if you have multiple classes you could put it in here um you can choose a login type I um for um for most students for younger students I definitely like either the word or picture login types you can do email but it's more complicated because they all have to put their emails in and then you have to you know send it and then there's no like it's just it's more complicated word will be the fastest easiest way to get in um so I have a bunch of third graders I can ch choose what course I want to assign it in this case what I want to do is I'm going to put them on the Star Wars thing that we just saw um and you could also use the same UI if you want to go on and teach um some of our we have 20 hour courses that are available for k35 so this is fun and you like it and you want to keep going um you can use the same UI to teach one of those courses um and I hit save and now I've got this um new class and I can click on it or click manage students and enter some students I'm gonna zip ahead you guys can um there's also a thing here so you can see it I'm just going to zip into one of the courses I already have set up so you can see this if I look at um period one which is a course I already set up oh wait that was a test course with nobody in it hold on let me find one where I actually have students in it um okay this is the problem with doing all my testing here um period three might have students bu progress no sorry um period two third times the charm oh yeah real progress okay um so here we can see um if you do have it set up and I were on a i on just uh one of the hour code tutorials what I could see later after the class if I wanted to come back and look at it is I could take a look at all of my students in the class and I could see which which stages they'd all done so I could see Owen finished all 15 or sorry which levels Ryan finished all 15 Orlando um got to level eight Tila got to level LEL six then skipped ahead to eight and nine and Aina did up to level seven so if you want to save this information or you just want to have it later um that is how you would go ahead and do that um but again real time in the classroom just to do an hour of code completely unnecessary I don't recommend it I've never when I do hour of code I don't use any of this I just have the kids go ahead and do it without logging in so that is that question and thanks for showing it Alice I think that really made it clear for folks to actually have the demo so thank you um so we got a lot of other questions coming up I think that's probably the last demo we'll have if you want to stop sharing your screen um so back to the question of how do you choose a tutorial we had a lot of questions about how do you know what's age appropriate um and then also devices how do you know whether something's going to work on an iPad or Chrome versus n Explorer what do we suggest so all of the tutorials have it listed yeah it all has it listed and then code.org tutorials uh we we make them work on iPads iPhones everything Windows there yeah yeah we work on all os's all web browsers yeah so if you're not sure use code.org tutorial uh but all the other tutorials do have what they're uh compatible with written in the description yeah Y and I would just add on a lot of those descriptions there's a little link that says for teachers and if you click on that you can often find a lesson plan or some description of what concepts are covered in the tutorial teaching suggestions and then also how to modify it for grade levels and ability levels I know all of our tutorials at code.org have that and a number of our partners do as well um so as an educator it's really tiny print but look for that um that's one of the reasons why we suggest spending just a little bit of time before your hour of code playing around and being smart about what tutorials you select um as opposed to having your kids go Hog Wild but that could also be fun so I'm not against that all right so another question I know Alice would love to answer this one we've gotten about five or six people ask us are we ready for the number of people who are going to be hitting our website on December 7th we've been working really really really hard on that we've been doing a bunch of scale testing um we uh we have an engineer from Google who's been helping us yeah um we and from and from Amazon they've been helping us so um we are we as far as we could tell based on our scale testing we are ready um and we're definitely excited about it the other thing we've done this year um if any of you are international I don't know if if you are um is to set up and this is getting tactical but we've set up a Content delivery network uh we're using the content delivery Network so that it's the tutorials are local to where you are so if you're in Australia you no longer have to hit the east coast of the United States to get your tutorial which should mean everything just runs a lot faster and a lot smoother um and everybody should have better response times around the world so uh yeah I hope we're ready as far as we can tell from all testing we are um we're ready not only we ready we're ready for 10 times more than we predict um so that way you know if we're underestimating we're still ready so uh there's a question as to whether these tutorials are available for students outside the classroom or they have to be done during the school day they're available all the time 247 365 days a week yeah yeah so even you know if they want to do it we've had a lot of students do that where they do the hour of code and they want to go try another tutorial later on their own and they can absolutely do that or they don't finish in class home finish it for kids who are fast workers and those ones that you can never keep up with with the rest of the class pick out two or three tutorials so they have something else to go on to do after I'm sorry I'm just answering questions as you are as well in the chat P um so Alice you mentioned that there was a free play level in Minecraft um can you talk to us about what that means and what that is yeah we actually designed that in um the last level of the last three of our tutorials um and that's designed so that the kids have more like the kids who finish early have something to do so in the Frozen tutorial they can keep making their own ice art in the Minecraft level what we do is we give you so all of the tutorial levels have been done in this sort of little square and on the last level we open it up so the square is nine times as big there's this whole space and they've learned Loops so they can build things that just keep going on and on and on and on and on um and we also give them new new materials new things that they can use and they can go do whatever they want and build it and keep exploring and you know making more things happen um which you know allows them to keep playing in that tutorial on the Star Wars tutorial we've done the same thing so on the last level basically we're teaching you how to make your own Star Wars game and so as you go along you learn oh I can make something happen when I hit the up key I can make sounds happen I can make something happen when I touch a certain guy like if I touch a stormtrooper I can make it lose points or I can make a gain points and so we teach you all these little building blocks along the way and then the last level is now you have all the building blocks go build your own game and again we give you new things that you haven't had before so we give you new sounds that you've never been able to use before and we give you new um new uh new blocks you can use new commands you can use um I saw one group of students um play with it for over an hour just on the last level um where all they were doing was for the last hour just you know playing games trying each other's games editing it doing more features on the games um and that's designed to be that way actually my son I had to stop him after two hours because it was dinner um I just told him he wasn't allowed to keep working on his game in Star Wars so yes yes you can uh you can definitely definitely keep playing on the last levels the idea that they can share the games with other students to play so it's not just on their computer then they you can have them all swapping around trying out everybody's game yeah I think if you let them do it they do it on their own but if you encourage it they will totally have fun with that yeah great so I thought it might be fun to try out the interactive feature I've got six folks who would like to actually ask you questions Laura and Alice um so there are a number of folks whose names I have um if you no longer have a question please do lower your hand um but I'll just go right down the line and Evelyn I saw that you have a question I'm going to go ahead and approve you him as well if you guys would like to unmute and um ask your question um and ladies I don't know what the question will be so this should be a fun experiment to see how it goes gone okay so we'll just give them a second hello I'm also approving you great so while we're waiting if if I've approved you now you can go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question while we're waiting for that we got a lot of questions about um whether you had to start at the beginning and work your way all the way through for our tutorials or whether you could kind of bounce around and related to that if a student starts and wants to come back the next day or at home how does that work so if there's a few answers like that's like three questions I'm gonna answer them all um so first of all you can Skip and we do that on purpose we do that because sometimes if a kid is really stuck um I just encourage him to go to the next level and keep having fun um but I would encourage the kids not to skip unless they need to right so start off by just telling your kids to go through it in order most kids don't realize they can skip so they just keep going through it in order um but you'll see is if you're one of your students um you you know if you see one of your students who's really struggling just go ahead and help them skip ahead to the next level um that's true of our tutorials it's not true of all the tutorials so if you're in one of the other tutorials it might work differently um each tutorial has its own sort of progression way of doing that the second question was how do I save it to go back to it later so um because you can start anywhere um the easiest thing to do again is not make accounts don't log in if your student is on level seven when they're finish in class just go home and go right into level eight and keep going there's no reason they need to do one through seven again they can just start on level eight so there they don't need to save their particular progress they just start where they go if they get to the last level and they're building their own personalized thing right like they're building this really cool Minecraft thing or they're building a Star Wars game or anything like that they can save when they click finish a little dialogue will come up um with a link in it that they can save um and it also has a way for them to share that on Facebook or Twitter if your class allows that if they're at home maybe they'll do that if they're younger kids they're you know then obviously not um but um but yeah if they save if you just copy and paste that URL or write it down um then they can go get their own particular game back so they can keep working on their Star Wars game at home or share it with a friend and their friend can keep working on it so that's a lot of fun too so I think we're ready for questions I think we are we've got some folks on Deck so I'm sorry I don't know your name so um if you could just tell us your name where you're from ask your question you need to unmute your mic and for anyone else who would like to speak to our presenters tonight just click on the little hand icon and I'll get you queued up so let's start with our friend with the uh green scarf neck piece yes you my dear would you like to start yes this is Evelyn how are you hi well you know what it's been a hustle to get this on I had a Bor meeting at school I escaped the Bor meeting I drove home and I put you on my phone and I drove as fast as I could without getting into any accidents and I got home and I'm like yes I made it so I'm here excellent I am in New York wonderful okay so you know I'm in love with code I started using uh this program with my students and they love it they love it um the days were're up from school because it was a holiday I noticed that they were using it at home and now is been used as a motivator for them to complete some of the work so it is very popular and I'm getting everybody on school administrator they don't know what this is about but I'm like hello don't worry get you back I I call it come on let's Cod wonderful do you have a question for us yes you know I uh the kids always ask me because I'm also new I went to e 2015 this year so that's when I get in love I got in love with this and I've been working with this um I've been working with students ages six through 10 11 years old and they're also Spanish speaking most of them so it's great they're trying to use the language and you know collaborate uh with each other but uh my question is like what do I do when I finish I'm like I really don't know and that I don't know if this answer has been a question have been answered but this is something that I would like to you know I think they want to see an end and you know they they completed the program and they're like What's now I have a couple of them that are doing the studio the 20 hours and they're very excited but uh is there a way to answer that question yeah there lots of answers yeah um so if they're doing the hour of code um I recommend one of three things depending on the kids their age so either go help another student finish um you know your classroom best you're going to be the best one to judge whether that's the right thing in your class right um or keep playing on the you know the free play um level that we put at the end of the Tut tutorials um I think you know the Star Wars one in particular you can play for a long long long long time um so that when if you're worried about the kids finishing early I would recommend using the Star Wars one because there's lots and lots of space to keep making their games and playing their games and sharing their games um or try another tutorial and you can either have one lined up for them to try um or you could just say go you know you're free you finished go pick something um and then it related to your other question of finishing the courses so if they finish course one you can go to course two or course three or course fer or if they finish early within a class one of the things we've done within our um K5 courses or sorry CS fundamentals courses um is every every level has a little Link at the top to go create your own project or play lab or artist and so um there's just activities the students can do there to help like create their own projects or create their own artist things but related to hour of code I would just tell them play in the free play level or go ahead and do another tutorial one easy thing to do would be start them in Star Wars and if they finish that send them to Minecraft or Versa um I'd be really surprised if students get through both of those tutorials in an hour we've done a lot of testing and I'd be shocked if six to 10 year olds could finish both of those in one hour yeah even the fast ones yeah the thing is you know I created account so I gave them their use you know their username um and the password so they're using it at home I'm like what happened they did it at home which I love you know it's a motivation and I said I want the test scores to go up then this year that's awesome I love it I love it that's a good problem to have the kids are doing school work at home so they nothing to do with school that's like that's a good problem I would explore some our third party tutorials they're great they are great they are great thank you Evelyn um so had some bye thank you for making the effort to be here we have about 10 minutes left and a lot of questions on Deck there also a lot of questions in the chat pod that we're responding to I just want to make sure folks know that we are we have recorded this session so that you'll be able to watch it later and then on December 2nd we're going to have a followon Q&A session so if I don't get to your question tonight or Alis or Laura don't don't worry there are still lots of ways to get support um including another call just like this one in a couple weeks um so I can see a couple folks on video I also have given microphone rights to other folks um if someone wants to unmute and go ahead and ask a question that's great we'd be happy to answer it how about Elizabeth I see you see you up here I think we lost our Diana hi hello ladies hi my this is my first year I normally teach Math and Science my first year that we're starting a stem program in our school and I am teaching a technology special so I've really been able to spend a lot of time on code my students have been working already for a couple weeks so we're very very excited I've really been pushing it and it's unbelievable um how um much problem solving is involved and they really are just amazing me so a big thank you to what you are what you guys are doing as a as a as a company as an organization um I just quick questions and I know they've probably been answered but I've been messing around with the computer and I I've had a couple times where the sound has gone off um but just to clarify um it is okay for them to already be working on the on the tutorials is that correct oh right now yes yes you can um they're in beta right now um which means we're still changing and improving them so we put them out there and then what we like to do is get a lot of feedback we've been testing them in classrooms I've taken them to second grade class High School class third fourth fifth grade class A couple another high school class I took him to an intro took him to an English class in high school where the kids had never done computer science before we took him to an AP Computer Science class so basically just trying to get lots of feedback from students and then what we're looking for are what do we need to do to change it so since we launched them last week and the week before we have clarified some error messages we've changed a few progressions we swapped levels three and four in the Star Wars to make it a little easier we made a couple things a little harder so we are making them better every day you are welcome to try them and we love getting you know the feedback early um it just makes them better for the other students so um that's great um just know that there's going to be some subtle changes between now and the hour of cod and on December 7th be great you know then there'll be the fully tested version that's ready for your class gotcha I I you know because they're doing it um in my class I they have passwords and they're able to log in from home and I do track their progress um I haven't been able to track I didn't see the a track from Minecraft is it just because it's still in beta we have to add it to the teacher dashboard we'll get that added we just added that it comes out later the next time we dtp sorry the next time we we it's it's in our stag in server so by tomorrow afternoon see that in the list yes awesome now will the ones that the PE the students that have been working on Minecraft already will that appear on the progress or it's only okay yeah yeah they'll have their progress there yeah great great and one one last quick question sorry one last quick question I'm getting feedback from the kids that are saying that they have to be in Google Chrome to be able to access that is that correct no no they use any browser um it works on Chrome you knowx it should work everywhere yeah okay so much great thank you thank you Diana so we have about three or four more folks who had raised their hand to ask questions so Flo JN Elizabeth and nice I see nice nice n's video is up um so if any of you would like to unmute go right ahead and ask a question we lost nice okay so if anyone else has a question and need raise your hand go ahead and unmute feel free and ladies just a couple more here in my list um let's see we went over the certificate procedure a couple times but there were a couple folks who are having an issue with it um so maybe we could just review that one more time and then JN I just saw you unmute did you want to go ahead and ask your question while Laura pull it up Laura's going to screen share the certificate that yeah go ahead wondering I had um asked for certificates to be sent and I saw in the discussion um somebody had written that they would be coming soon I just wanted to make sure that they would be sent to the school yeah posters the the the posters uh we gave away awesome posters and stickers to the first 15,000 teachers who signed up for the hour of code and those started shipping this week uh and they should be arriving and uh whatever address that you put in that's where it'll be coming um if you want to contact support at code.org we can look up your name and make sure we know which uh address it's coming to but they were being shipped out this week okay thank you very much on that note too Laura while you're showing this um I there are a couple questions in the chat pot of people saying that their event isn't showing up on the map how do they know it's been registered should people email support at code.org if they want to know so the map is updated once a day usually at midnight Pacific time so if they if you're not seeing it right away it's because it's not a live map and so at midnight we scoop up everybody who's added an event and we put it on the map uh another thing that might be happening is if you're not typing in the full exact address it might be mapping you but to a different state or a different country so make sure you're typing in state and zip code to get it as exact as possible uh the third thing is you'll notice that we have some orange pens on the map and those are special events that we've highlighted uh we do those manually so here at code.org we read through those special events uh and we can highlight them on the map and so we don't we don't approve every event that's submitted we approve a handful of them as we get them uh and as we're able to check them um as frequently as we can show us certificates real quick yeah so here's code.org certificates uh and it's as easy as typing in your name uh or your students names uh and then you can do a whole list you can copy and paste their names in here because that would probably be a lot faster and then click on print certificates and it's going to bring up a preview of these certificates so you'll see a whole list of them ready to go and this is print ready so you can just print them by clicking that button and they're designed to print well in black and white or color we designed it so it'll look good even if you don't have a color printer other a question as to whether people could print a blank one and write the name on it later if you go without typing any name in it and you clicked print certificate a great one um we can add we'll have to figure that out we might be able to add a blank one to the resource page for teachers we'll look into that okay great now poor Elizabeth has been in and out trying to get her mic on so I'm gonna let her go and then nice you can go next um and then we'll probably close out the question section okay Elizabeth yeah um one question that I've had was can you hear me okay yeah okay um whenever students are doing the hour of code their progress saves at the top and I've had problems with when another student comes in that they're they're want to start at the beginning and that shows the other students progress and um one of the other people said that if I used incognito mode that would take care of that it would that work um yeah that would work but we've also um solved that problem we we if you click on so if you go to the name of the tutorial SL reset it will also reset it all and we've made it so that the links from slash learn automatically go to that slash reset so if you instead of just going directly to the you can do it in cognito mode or if you go to instead of going to the URL um if you I think the URLs do it this year too um but anyway if you click go on them it'll automatically reset for the next student um so I think that's new this year I don't think we had that last year so they just need to go back to the page and hit go again hit goarn and it'll automatically when you hit go again it automatically resets everything so you get a fresh start that's great thanks yeah okay nice um would you like to unmute and ask your question and Kiren if we have time I'll get to you as well go ahead we can hear you hi everybody hello nice from Sagal d I have just one question is about how to organize a successful event res have Network a good internet connection yeah no I think that the unplugged lessons are fantastic when you don't have a great internet connection I have done the unplugged lessons with different age kids they're really fun and they teach the same concepts of computer science without the computer so um that is a great way to to do it um we're also looking at whether there's some you know offline tutorial there isn't right now so right now i' recommend doing the unplugged lesson but check back on the site and if we can get something up that's offline before December 7th you could try that as well and I don't know if you have if you have access to desktop computers but we do have um a blockly tutorial uh that I believe UN in the unplugged section that you can download to your desktop and do on your desktop there's also one created by codable one of our partners that you can download to your desktop as well that'd be a good choice if you try the codable one download and in advance and then you can do it through you can chat us your uh email address we'll send you the links to both of those thank you nice thanks for the question kren do you want to close us out with the last question hi hi um so I I this is actually a technical question I got a confirmation email saying you know welcome to the hour of code and then when I go to sign on it says it doesn't recognize my email address and so I've now signed up like four or five times I'm actually the principal of the school and um I want to sign up my whole school my all my teachers have signed up so I wanted to be able to get credit as my school has signed up but I've contacted support and I haven't gotten any response from them either and I'm just starting to I just I'm worried that what if this happens on the day you know the week that we're doing it I'm trying to run this whole school's worth of of coding and I've promoted to my parents and I'm doing all this stuff and I can't even get into my own account so I didn't know if you had any suggestions about what to do and you have like a technical difficulty um I have plenty of time now to fix it but I'm worried about something like that happening did you you you signed up for the hour of code and now you're trying to go to code.org and sign into your account so signing up for the hour of code doesn't create a code Studio account for you this is a great question I'm sure a lot of teachers think this as well um when you sign up for the hour code that's a totally separate form if you want to create a code Studio account on code.org you have to fill out create an account on there so um that's definitely something we should put on our FAQs yeah we should we should We'll add that to the FAQ I think the reason for that is we wanted to make it easy to sign up for hour of code without creating an account on code Studio so that's why we have two different processes there um but yeah if you go to code Studio you can now click that signin button and then say you want to create a new account and you can create a code Studio account but you also do not need one as I was saying before you do not need one to do hour of code and you don't need one to run it for your school so your school's already sounded up it sounds like and you can go ahead and the students all your students and all your teachers can do the hour of code with no accounts yeah and that's all designed to make it easy yeah okay yeah so I thought so because we could we had access to the tutorials and everything but I was trying to do kind of the resources and the lesson plans and things like that and I was like why is my email not working okay so I have to sign up separately yeah very common good question good question great question a good one to end us on um because it allows me to segue into Ken Alice demoed how to create an account earlier tonight so when I send you the recording later you may want to go back and just watch that section um but we also have a whole bunch of resources on code Studio an hour of code.com that answerers some of these FAQs and some demo videos and things like that so thank you for bringing that question forward uh Laura do you want to go back to the fli just real quick yeah um we're out of time we're actually over time this has been a great discussion it's been so fun to hear you guys and to hear your questions I'm certain that we missed a lot of questions in the chat but um I think Kate Alice Laur and myself can hang out for a few minutes and try to answer things um but if you did not get your question answered tonight you have a bunch of options um first of all we are going to be having another meeting just like this on December 2nd um with Alice and our founder of code.org K partovi and the full hour will be dedicated to Q&A so you can bring your questions then um you can also tweet your questions to us at teach code or at code org and we will answer via Twitter and then if you have a technical question if you think there's something wrong with your account or you found a bug or something like that definitely email that to support code.org and we'll answer it that way as well so just a few quick reminders if you haven't already registered your hour of code event please do and as you're celebrating hour of code this year whether you're doing it during the um CS education week of December 7th through the 14th or any other time make sure that you share your pictures your stories your videos your successes your failures everything with us at hasag hourofcode we really really love seeing what teachers are doing and as you could tell from this webinar um we've learned a lot from you we hope that you'll join us on December 2nd at 500 pm for more Q&A with Al as well as with hottie and I think the last slide just has oh just some reminders that um code.org we have a teacher commun be available to you you can follow us on Twitter at teach code um we have a Blog at teer blog. code.org and we have an online Forum which also includes places where you can discuss hour of code the different courses and um how you can get support from other teachers and from us so thank you for joining us tonight we'll hang out just for a few more minutes in the chat pod I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording if you registered for the event tonight I'm going to send you an email shortly with a link to the recording as well as a link to the slide deck um and any other resources that Alice and Laura and I think should be emailed after the conversation so thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it thank you Alice and Laura thanks by bye bye bye so we should just
