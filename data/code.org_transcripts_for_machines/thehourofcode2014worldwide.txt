You're learning and you're playing. I got it! I ran an Hour of Code. It's easy to do. They're learning how things are created in a technological world and that's their world and their upcoming world. Every district should do, every district can do it. I'm actually seeing the kids in elementary school start coding and this is amazing. I'm so excited! I'm actually going to code. You love it? Yes, I love it. Is coding super fun? YES! If you can change technology, you can change the world. I challenge girls in every single country to learn one Hour of Code. Computer science can unlock the best opportunities in the world, no matter where you are. Please help us get the Hour of Code to 100 million students this year and my school is doing it!
