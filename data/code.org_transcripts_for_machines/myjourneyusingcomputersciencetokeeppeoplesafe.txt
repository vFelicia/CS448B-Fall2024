oh and good morning everyone thank you to all the classrooms tuning in for today's my journey class chat my name is victoria chavez i am the state policy fellow at code.org on our advocacy team today we're excited to welcome richard nelson who is part of a team that plays a crucial role in technology to keep people safe at motorola with a background in mechanical engineering business and computer science richard also enjoys helping underrepresented students with their future goals and technology teachers please let us know where you're tuning in from and put your students questions for richard in the q a and we'll try our best to get to some of those during the chat today we'll start with a fun icebreaker to get us started and so richard as you are introducing yourself if you can let us know your goto comfort food good morning victoria that's a great question um so go to comfort food i i think a lot of people think of like dessert uh when you pick up comfort food but for me my goto comfort food is the same exact food is like my favorite food overall um that's mac and cheese so i love both my mom and my wife's mac and cheese so i like it's like i could literally eat that every day when i was in college i thought i could eat it every day but it's not you know eating the little easy mac is not the same as the homemade uh you know mac and cheese that you know that i love one makes so if i can eat something every day that would definitely be it so i definitely might go to comfort food oh that sounds awesome i'm not absolutely the dessert person cookies chocolate all the sweet stuff that's my goto food but homie mac and cheese is really delicious i agree beautiful thank you so much um so thank you for do you wanna share anything uh before we get started with the with the questions a little bit about yourself sure uh so a little bit about i mean i know you gave a great intro um my background is in mechanical engineering and computer science and business um i'm from south florida originally so i'm really excited to be able to share some of my experience with uh with all the classrooms that are dialed in today um and if you have any questions feel free to feel free to share them beautiful thank you so much richard so to get started can you tell us a little bit about what you do sure thing so i'm actually going to share my screen to show a little bit of some illustrations that kind of highlight a little bit about what i've done here at motorola so far so uh am i sharing okay everything good yep perfect okay so starting off so i started i joined monroe back in 2019 um as a mechanical engineer so a lot of what i did uh was supporting our current products that are in the field and first off about you know motorola solutions um i know you might you hear motorola you probably think of like the razer you know like the classic most iconic cell phones uh yep so nowadays you make mission critical radios right so one of the things and i'll talk a little bit more about that um in a minute but from the mechanical engineering side what that means is that we're making radios for our customers which largely include you know firefighters police officers emt in the military it's really important that um the products that we're making are extremely rugged and durable so that way they can survive in the environments that our customers are using them in because when they're there are everyday heroes so one of the things that mechanical engineer that i did a lot of is testing for example so here on the left i have a video of uh for all you know everyone who's team iphone you might cringe seeing this video this is a steel ball dropping onto an iphone screen um don't know whose phone that is but uh it's just like i just for you know illustrator comparison comparison um now what you'll see is one of our newer apex next radios which has you know also has a touchscreen on it and you can see how the screen does not shatter uh so there's a lot of engineering that goes into you know designing products to be that rugged and then here on the right you know this is an example of something the impact testing that we do now funny enough i i didn't have a video handy um showing a radio but i did have a radio uh featuring a football so we did this for our bring a child to work the event last year um so in your mind just imagine there being a radio there instead of a football but what we typically use this machine for is to actually um it so to speak bring the floor to the radio because we do a lot of drop testing um so a lot of times we'll drop radios from various heights to make sure they can survive that impact in this case we've been the force the radio to try to simulate a direct impact at a certain point uh so that's of course you know we have a little bit of fun every now and then as always um so we have like that was a great great thing we did in celebration of a college football season but that's a little bit about what we do from the testing side and all that testing fuels a lot of our design work um when it comes to doing uh you know designing radios for portable um situations where let's say like a firefighter helping officer on their hip um or for you know mobile situations such as a police officer having like a radio in their car i think you know all types of radios we're designing we're designing and testing and simulating it's really fun really handson so i've had i had a lot of fun in that role and then my recent role i transitioned to a new team where i'm actually working as a product manager and to kind of highlight what i'm doing in this new role is i'm learning a lot more about cloud technology so in the photos on the left these are some photos from you know right after hurricane katrina so when natural disasters like this happen you know it's super important that public safety officials are able to communicate now they can't just rely on the same cell service that we rely on every day because i mean just just imagine that if you were in the situation most most people's first response is i need to find out if my loved ones are safe right so everyone's on the phone everyone's calling and i kind of you know make a comparison to when you're at home if everyone is like watching netflix at the same time your your internet speed is probably going to go down on your device because it's kind of you know everyone's you know using up that bandwidth same thing kind of what happens in real life uh for um communications so if everyone's using that bandwidth on them from their cell phones it can you know it can actually cause calls to drop um in communications to fail so police officers and um in the you know in the in the military when they're coming out to help help out and save people they have to rely on their own radio frequencies to be able to communicate so a lot of that you know supporting hardware and infrastructure that that's on their sites to help do that a lot of that we're moving to the cloud to make it even more resilient so that way in these type of situations if they have just even more confidence that when they make a call to help you know to try to dispatch someone out to save someone that that call will go through and work this is this is incredible thank you so much richard how how did you decide to do this work i mean this sounds really incredible oh a great question so uh i have one one other video as well that i want to share that kind of helps illustrate that so when i learned a little bit more about motorola does right it really piques my interest in the company and i think one of the best things that kind of illustrates this is looking at some situations that you know our customers are in so on the screen you see a video of firefighters running out of a burning building and you can see how a lot of them are engulfed by the flame right um so this is this actually happened in los angeles california about two years ago and it was incredible seeing this footage this is just coming straight off of youtube um and seeing this on the news seeing this on youtube i was like wow this is like insane um i've i mean i can't imagine being in that type of situation now working here at motorola you know i i learned that we actually provide the radios to this firefighter team in los angeles california and they were the photos on the right on the right show the actual after images of what their products look like um we actually were able to talk to the fire chief and you know he basically retold the story of what was going on before that that that flame basically engulfed half of the half of the fire ladder um and they were really able to get out just in the nick of time if they hadn't been able to communicate effectively you know they wouldn't have been able to save the lives that they saved and get out safely no one died in that incident which was amazing we love we'd love to hear those type of stories um and the incredible part from the engineering side is that looking at some of these photos on the right i mean these look pretty beat up because they literally were in fire right i mean they were on fire for you know for a good while when they were coming down that ladder every single device you see on the screen still works somehow which is incredible i it's kind of amazing looking at this when i when i when i received this package at my desk um when i got to the office it i opened it up and it smelled like a barbecue but nonetheless when i put a battery on you know i was able to turn the radio on and it still worked which is amazing so it's kind of a tribute to the type of engineering work we do here at motorola and that's what not only lord middle motorola but also definitely helps keep my interest in staying here at motorola wow that is that is so impressive thank you so much for sharing and these images are really telling of the work that you're doing how you're how you're saving lives which is really really cool um as a before we move on as a reminder to our audience feel free to drop some questions in the chat and we will we will ask ricky the questions from your classes while teachers start collecting some questions and students are thinking about what what they want to ask i'm sure they have tons of questions there's there's so much that can be asked about what you've said so far i'm really curious to know what role does computer science play and what you do oh great question so it plays a variety of roles actually i i know i'm a mechanical engineer by trade um but as a you know having the cs minor has really helped me out a lot and being able to automate things uh so i'll give an example so one of the things that we do is actually collect data on radio so this is a a video of me inside of one of our labs at work and in the background you guys see you see a whole bunch of wires and like uh and you know pieces of equipment that are all hooked up together it looks really complicated but in a nutshell what that all that stuff does um is it basically on one side you can actually plug in a radio um right and it it basically connects like a knob on a radio so it measures something called torque torque is basically just like the force required to turn something right just so you could just think of it from that perspective so on one side you have a radio on the other side you have a laptop that basically outputs the data so i'm going to fast forward a little bit to the end and you can actually see an example and yes i i could not find a good still shot so every every single one of these shots i wind up making an awkward phase it's really weird but nonetheless this is an example of some of the output data that we get so two things that i want to mention here in terms of why computer science is really important so one um i was actually able to write a script that automatically analyzes this data and gives me a lot of the important detail because just looking at the screen you know as an engineer there's some there's some um deductions that i can make about the design in terms of like if if things are good or things need to be improved but if i wanted to communicate this more effectively and be able to you know speed up my design process to make things better it would be nice to be able to just kind of take this file put it into a script and have it analyze it for me so i was actually able to write a script to do that now what exactly does the stuff on the screen mean uh it what this really does is like i said it measures the amount of force required to turn so imagine if again you're a police officer and let's say you see you know uh a criminal steal someone's uh backpack right and they're running down the street and you're chasing after them and your radio's on your hip and uh you need to call for backup right as you're running um if your radio you know if the volume knob is really really loose so it it rubs against you and your radio accident turns off that would be a problem because then when you pick up your radio and try to make a you know try to push to talk you know your radio is not going to make a call and and those seconds are really really important because that could be the difference between you know catching the person or or not catching them um or that could be the difference between saving someone's life and not saving someone's life so every little second matters uh so measuring the amount of force required is really important to our users because they want to make sure that they're not you know accidentally um triggering things on the radio that they don't want to happen so the radio on the left is without something called a a torque adder so it basically without having it the torque is the the force required is really low so you'll have more accidental you know knob movement the one on the right the torque is a lot higher because we added a little piece of or basically a rubber um inside of our knob which makes the user experience much better and makes it less likely for accidents like that to happen so writing code to be able to analyze that and you know once we collect all that data um it's really really helpful because it allows us to do what's made those decisions on the fly you know much faster and get to like the best design possible awesome well thank you so much for sharing that and for having these awesome graphics it's really cool to be able to see you know we saw the stuff that you do with you know testing the actual radios and now getting getting to see what you do with the code is very very cool so thank you for sharing that the problem outside of work what do you enjoy doing what's with something interesting about you good question okay so outside of work so i think as mentioned in my bio um i'm a huge basketball fanatic i mind you i love all sports um so i've taken i've taken up some more sports like uh i've recently taken off golf taking up tennis i've always loved uh football and volleyball but basketball is definitely like that's that's like the sport that i love so i'm a huge huge fan so uh recently on uh you know march 5th which is 305 day because i am from miami originally went to a heat game so you can see a little a little snippet of that and bernie you know having a great time so it was really really fun uh we want to win that game so if you're not a heat fan i'm sorry but if you aren't great uh that was that was good you know number one in the east so i'm super happy about that um and then i also love playing basketball on the weekends as well especially too i'm actually trying to get out there more often the way i used to back when i was in high school in college um but i've been playing ever since i was probably about about five years old um so it's definitely been a sport that i've loved for a long time um and then next to basketball i also really love music so to this day i still try to you know get active in garageband and just kind of tinker around you know make different songs make beats um different type of just some types of music and i started off in music back in i want to say um fifth fifth grade um was when i first picked up um my first instrument which was trombone and i played that in the band uh all the way up through high school so i have a little clip here on the right um let me know if you can hear if not i'll make sure that yep i'll make sure i make that adjustment marching band and basketball were like some of my favorite memories of definitely like from high school so this is still a big part of who i am in terms of like loving basketball living music very cool very cool um it looks like we have a question uh from the audience uh so it looks like miss lyons wants to know how long have you played basketball oh good question so yes i played basketball so i'm i just turned 25 not too long ago so wow i guess that's about 20 years that's crazy i really had thought about that wow that is that is quite a while very cool and it's i think it's so cool to to know that you know we can we computer scientist identifies our computer clients as well can be so wellrounded you know we can we can be technologists we can do the computer stuff we can do the engineering stuff and we can be super athletic awesome at sports we can be super musicians that's it's so great to see that absolutely we're getting oh we're getting some more questions in the chat so uh ms garda asks what program oh my goodness things things are happening what program language do you use programming language do you use in your job good question okay so let's see um so there's two that i've used uh like more often right so um one of the things that i did um last year was i joined what's called an alpha team um where we basically come up with like new ideas and uh basically build many versions of them and then if they're successful then they want to get incorporated into like what we do so part of that project was learning a new program language called rust so it's very similar to c and it's it's uh but it's a lot more secure in a lot of ways without getting too technical it's kind of like a slightly uh improved version of like c or c plus so i use a lot of that last year um but prior to that i definitely think that c plus plus or some version of c plus was probably the most popular because if i was you know in the example that i used earlier in the video um to write that code i did it in something called matlab um matlab is basically a program that is built basically on c um and then the actual um device that automatically turns the radio knobs um an intern actually take that project off and then i modified it but he used something called an arduino and arduinos also use um basically c or two plus plus as kind of like their native programming language so a lot of what i use mostly is c or c plus plus very cool very cool i would love to know uh for our teachers and students in the audience if you're using any of those languages in your classrooms or if you are familiar with them uh that would be really interesting to know you know you shared a lot of languages that are used so that's that's awesome thank you for sharing um we have a couple more questions uh so ida is curious to know what's what's the salary range for for position your position or position similar to yours good question so uh i will say that it probably varies by like location in the country so for like when i started the salary range for me was between like upper 60 000 to like uh upper 70 000 so that's kind of like the range where you start though i will admit that there are definitely a lot of opportunities to get raises and bonuses um especially at a company like motorola um and as the market gets more competitive i think some of those numbers are also like on the rise as well too which is fun when you're an engineer so that's great um and then i i i as i mentioned i'm based out of i still live in south florida to this day so as you move more like west a lot of times salaries will go up to kind of account for the cost of living that makes sense absolutely and besides getting to be in florida which is your home state uh emmanuel would like to know what's your the favorite part of your job good question so favorite part of my job oh it's man that's tricky hmm you know okay so i think one of the outside of like the technical like testing because that that's pretty fun um outside of creating stuff because i always love creating stuff one of the things that i found to be really really fun is just the opportunities to connect with other people i know like over the past you know two years you know we've all been separated in a lot of new ways because of the pandemic um so here at motorola so there's two groups that i'm a part of um one is called the young professionals group and the other one is called embito which is the motorola black inclusion diversity organization and i'm actually the president of that group for the company globally and both of those groups have amongst our other business councils within our company i spearheaded a lot a lot of initiatives to bring people together so we've had some opportunities to you know play games virtually together online um have opportunities to have speed networking sessions um and just get a chance just to just connect with people because a lot of times when you're you know cooked up in your house all you know for a long time and you kind of long for having you know that connection with just other people um i during most of the pandemic there were there were a few times as a mechanical engineer where i had going to the office still because i i mean i can't bring you know millions of dollars of equipment back home to my house with me also it's pretty heavy but um for the mo a lot for a good portion of it i was able to work remotely um and now in my current role i'm pretty much fully remote but i go back into office when i when i help out with hosting um inperson events so a lot of those inperson events again chance to connect with other people is really what um it's it's super fun because you meet people from all different walks of life um you've got a chance to learn from other people and their career paths um and how they can intersect with yours and it makes it a lot easier to learn more about what you're interested in and what opportunities are you know around in the company because there's not you know a lot of times you get when you get your first job there's not like a whole board that lays out all the options so the more people you know the more like holistic picture you have of like the opportunities you have for your career so it's been a lot of fun to meet a lot of people awesome and i think you hit you had a bunch of questions that we had uh one of the questions was do you do you work from home and it sounds like you do you do a little bit of work right you have to go into the office to do the testing but there's there's some work that you can do from home and relatedly sherry turner asks if do you get to travel with your job yes so oh cool story uh so actually next week i'm getting a chance to travel um so i'm i've been a member of the national study of black engineers since i was in college and now as a professional i get a chance to go there and help recruit um so i'll be going to california for the first time in a while i've been there before but it's been a couple of years um and then after that i will hopefully be able to go to indiana um to get to meet with some actual customers to talk with them and get their perspective on some of the cloud technology that we're that we're working on so yep definitely some opportunities to travel for sure that sounds awesome we have uh another question well we have a lot of questions i unfortunately don't think we're gonna be able to get to all of it because i've looked at the time we only have six minutes left uh but from marine garda how do you protect the police networks from cyber attacks perhaps you know it looks like it sounds like you do a lot more of the hardware so does that perhaps have to do do you have do you have to put some extra security with the work that you're doing in the cloud or do you maybe do that with some third parties that's a great question so it's funny because i've been learning a lot more about that in my new role especially because we're working a lot more with cloud now i will say that even aside from cloud um like cyber security is like a whole part of motorola i mean it's a whole career path within motorola in and of itself and i've made some friends in that in that group and learned a little bit more about that so even without the cloud technology cyber security is so important because i mean it's kind of like the wave of the future in terms of like analyzing threats and trying to prevent them from happening um i mean i know like over the past couple of years a lot of cities have been attacked and had like a lot of their data data centers held hostage and it's costed you know millions of dollars or you know there's been information leaked so it's super important um so that's something that we get we definitely hold in high regard and in my new current role with uh you know we're focusing on on cloud technology it's also super important um one of the benefits of cloud technology is that we can roll out you know security patches and updates in real time like across the country across the globe to be honest um so it makes it much more difficult for you know a cyber attacker to keep up with us when we can move that you know that ad in that agile fashion um so that's one of the perks of like switching to a more cloudbased platform very cool awesome thank you so much we're running a little tight on time so just in case you run out of time i what are some what's an obstacle you faced um and relatedly what pieces of advice would you give to all of the students tuning in definitely okay so one obstacle that i face that um comes to mind um and uh as like i mentioned when i first my major was mechanical was mechanical engineering um when i first started at florida atlantic university it's my alma mater um that was my only major and i was originally gonna double major in business um and i wanted to actually changing that to a minor so i could also minor in computer science but the first time um in one of my classes right i never failed a class before um and i was i i entered fau as a junior because i got my a in high school and i was taking junior level classes as a freshman there was one class that was really hard um and there was a project that was like that could have really helped my grade um but it required that you know you had a code and i had really never quoted before as as a freshman in college i would like i just hadn't really had experience with that um and i didn't pass the class and that was really really hard for me um because i that was that was new um i took the class again the following year and the the only difference is that a i mean yes i've seen the material before yeah but i still didn't understand it you know until i learned how to study a little bit better for that class but the the main thing that changed was that i learned how to code so i had added my cs minor i had taken my first c my first intro to c class and that made a world of difference if i got like a minus or b plus in the class second time around just because it's a lot a lot of engineering is learning how to learn so as kind of transitioning into like advice the earlier you start um you know learning the principles of being creative thinking outside the box and how to code right because that's really important even if you're not a computer science major it's still super helpful to have those principles down early early on because when you get to college it helps you break down problems into bitesized pieces um and literally once you learn one code it's easier to learn other ones so i mean whether you learn python or c or java it's just important just to get started and there's no time better than the president to do that absolutely yes i completely agree once once you learn one language once you learn the fundamentals you can really pick up other languages so much more easily this crucial point there relatedly to you were talking about your experience in college um and so from zina pounds he wants has a question if wants to know have you completed any internships and if so which oh good question yeah so i've actually tried to talk about that earlier um so coming into college um obviously i had no like internship experience with engineering um when i by time i graduated i actually had five internships internships are like super super helpful um for a number of reasons that we don't have time to get into for today but as far as the place i interned with i interned with a a utility company called fpl nexter energy i interned with a small biomedical company called full spine where i actually got to design something that was using a spinal surgery which is really cool um a little bit about medical mechanical engineers there i actually tend to intern with a manufacturing company called decimal engineering so i can see how stuff was made i'm behind the scenes i got a chance to work with an aerospace company called north of grumman in california that was fun it was the first time i ever lived away from home for more than like a month so that was cool and it was a brand new industry to me and then i also have a chance to work at a company called belkin which is also an aerospace company as well too um so that was all i think that's covers all five but yeah um i got like a wealth of experience wealth of knowledge um it made a lot of connections uh just from having those internships and i got them through uh networking events such as you know with national idea black engineer the society of hispanic professional engineers um the american association of blacks energy so applying for scholarships and and joining those professional you know memberships to college definitely another piece of advice that i would give because it definitely goes a long way to help expand the options um for your career absolutely i fully fully second that as someone who went what they would afford college to scholarships absolutely scholarships are so so important yes save here well richard thank you so much for answering all of our questions thank you to all the teachers and students tuning in and for all the awesome questions that you posed very sorry we couldn't get to all of them so excited that we have you tuning in i as a reminder we have a bunch more of these chats coming up and we have some previous recorded ones as well so to be able to access those uh and see what are the similar events that are coming up please go to code.org cs journeys and that's cs journeys of all lowercase uh to our wonderful teachers please check your email for a survey we really appreciate your feedback and helping improve these cs journeys chats again thank you so much everyone for tuning in this morning we really appreciate it and we hope you have a lovely rest of your day thank you for having me have a great one great day everyone thank you
