This is a conditional block. The code inside a conditional block runs if a condition is true. In puzzles with conditionals, we might want to check a condition, like if path ahead. This code only, move forward if there is a path ahead. You can use conditionals in lots of different ways, like this, or this. What if you want something else to happen if a condition is false? You can use an ifelse block for that. This code will move forward if there is a path ahead. Otherwise, it will turn left. Your code will either move forward or turn left, but never both. This is helpful if you want your code to make decisions based on certain conditions. Here are some more ways you can use conditionals in ifelse blocks.
