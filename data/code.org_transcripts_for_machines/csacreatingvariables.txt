we use variables a lot in coding but what exactly is a variable in short a variable is a container for storing a value that means like a baggie or a cop the container itself doesn't change but what you put in it can once created the variable is stored in the computer's memory and can be used and updated repeatedly throughout a program in java we have two specific types of variables primitive and reference variables in java primitive variables store our more basic pieces of data like ins for whole numbers doubles for decimals and booleans for true false let's use baggies with sticky notes in them to represent the number primitives and a toggle for the boolean primitive yellow for ins green for doubles and blue for booleans for objects such as strings we have reference variables think baggy with an arrow the container our baggie holds an arrow that points to a memory location where each object exists look inside the baggie the red arrow has a memory address on it the program can find that address in computer memory and look up information about the object see each pocket in memory we can store a lot of different pieces of information related to our object in there once we have decided we want to create a variable we have three distinct decisions to make number one what data type do we want maybe it's an int or double or string two what do we name the variable and three what if anything would we like to store in it for example let's say i want to store the number 8.5 which is the standard width of a piece of paper in inches what data type are we storing it's a decimal so we'll use double this is a primitive so we'll use a green long sticky note what do we name it with what if anything would we like to store in it 8.5 in java when declaring a variable we write the data type then the name of the variable followed by a semicolon we don't have to give the variable an immediate value but if we wanted to initialize a value we use the assignment operator we can also declare the variable and initialize in one line for a reference variable we will have our variable point to a place in memory strings are a great example of a reference variable for example let's create a string variable with the name cake color if we give it the value orange we place the text orange in memory and link to it from our variable cake color in java we would write this like so string cake color equals orange variable store information we can use in our programs
