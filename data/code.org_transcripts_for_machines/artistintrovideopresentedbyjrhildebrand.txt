You wouldn't even qualify for the race if you don't have people that are proficient in computer science because of how much data the cars collect and the necessity to be able to have people that can write programs to figure out how you continue to figure out how to build performance. In these puzzles, you'll be an artist that uses a pencil to draw different shapes. Wherever your artist goes, it will draw a line behind you. To move around the canvas, you'll use the move forward block. Here the move forward block says move forward by 100 pixels. When we hit run, what happens? The artist moves forward a certain amount and that amount is 100 pixels. Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen. The other block we have in this puzzle says turn right by 90 degrees. And when we drag that out that makes our artist turn a certain amount. So you can play around with how far you want the artist to turn. This is a 90 degree turn. And this is a 120 degree turn. And remember, you can change these values by clicking the arrows next to the numbers for pixels and degrees. Enjoy drawing with your artist!
