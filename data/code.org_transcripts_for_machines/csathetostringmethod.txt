i'm searching for a book at the library the library database shows images of book covers but when i click the book cover it doesn't show me all the information about the book instead i get this how can we fix this the library's database code for a book object doesn't tell java how to print the information about a book the library database could use the accessor methods for the instance variables in the book class to get this information for example we could use the get author method to get the author use the get title method to get the title then the numpages method to get the number of pages but it would be a bit tedious especially for multiple books the object class has a tostring method since it is the parent class of all classes in java this is called automatically every time we print an object the tostring method returns a string so when we use a print statement with an object it prints the string that is returned from automatically calling this method however it's impossible for the object class to know about all the attributes for all of the types of objects we could ever make in java this means the book class in the library's database program needs its own version of the tostring method when we give a child class its own version of a method that is in a parent class we are overriding the method to override a method we have to use the same method signature so for the tostring method we use the same method signature like this now we can specify what information to provide when we want to print an object we start by using the return keyword and then the string we want to return in this case we want to print the title the author and the number of pages when we print a book object since the tostring method is written inside the book class we can use the instance variables in the string we want to return let's create a book object in our tester class this cs book object is a book by code.org called adventures in java lab and it is a hundred pages when i print this book object using a print statement and run my code i get the information about the book java will check the book class first for a tostring method before moving up the hierarchy to the object class since our book class now has a tostring method it automatically calls it to get the string to print which means we don't have to call each accessor method for each book object now that we have a tostring method we can easily print the state of an object to the console see click on the book and it shows all kinds of information
