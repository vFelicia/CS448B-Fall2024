in the theater we can manipulate images to create image filters like the ones we see on many social media and photo editing apps these image filters are created by changing the image's pixel colors in the theater we have an image class that represents an image when we look at the image class we see that one of its instance variables is a 2d array of pixel objects a pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image an image consists of rolls and columns of pixels each pixel has a color value that is determined by a mix of red green and blue color values or rgb the pixel class represents a single pixel in an image it has instant variables for these red green and blue color values when we want to get a single pixel object from an image we can use the get pixel method we specify the x and y location of the pixel we want for the arguments we can also change a single pixel object using the setpixel method we can specify the x and y location of the pixel and the color we want to change it to the values for each color range from 0 to 255 0 would be very dark and 255 would be very bright an image file whether it's a jpeg gif or png contains lots of these rgb red green blue triplets to access color values in the pixel class we can use the get red get green or get blue methods to get these values for a specific pixel we can also use set red set green or set blue to change these values for a pixel if we set each of these values to 0 for all the pixels in this image our entire image would be filled with black pixels if we were to increase each of these values by a specific amount for all pixels in this image it would make our image even brighter what happens when we max out one of the colors let's push up the red values our entire image now has a red tint by using different combinations of red green and blue color values we can create a variety of interesting image filters with image and pixel classes we can create our own image filters like what we see on social media and photo editing apps we can combine these filters with the other capabilities of the theater to make creative animation and visuals you
