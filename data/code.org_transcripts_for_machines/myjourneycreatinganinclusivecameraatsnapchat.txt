hello everyone welcome my name is kanikiha and i'm a curriculum development manager here at code.org as a curriculum development manager that means i get to make lessons make activities uh make lessons plans lesson plans and gather feedback about how all of those things are working in classrooms from teachers and students like yourself who are tuning in today i'm really excited to join you all today and thanks to all the classrooms who are tuning in for today's my journey class chat teachers we've enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats today we are excited and lucky to welcome bertrand st prue as a product manager at snap who started and lead snap's inclusive camera team to ensure snap's camera works well for everyone regardless of their skin tone cultural background beauty standards or ability teachers please let us know where you're tuning in from and put your students questions for bertrand in the q a we'll try our best to get to some of those during the chat today uh merchant will start with a uh fun icebreaker uh so it's just a little would you rather would you rather be able to breathe underwater or be able to fly and i'll go first uh i think i'm gonna say flying i just i think the the idea of moving quickly through the air is a cool sensation and the the views that you could get from being able to fly are definitely uh something that i would treasure so how about yourself i'd definitely say flying as well um this it would make traveling so much easier there's so many places i'd be able to go um and i wouldn't need a car yeah for sure where someone where somewhere you would want to fly where you would want to travel if you had that ability japan easily japan oh very cool very cool my my my father's side of the family is from japan so i've lived there for a year so that's that's awesome cool very cool well uh well welcome bertrand again thanks for joining us today um we'd love to just start with a little uh introduction from yourself and if you could tell us a little bit about your work and what you do at snack yeah um so again my name is beatron sampua or bertrand st prue i'm a product manager at snapchat um and i work to build products to make the camera more inclusive no matter who you are um your skin tone your race culture beauty standards or just whoever you are essentially making the camera work for you uh and so that is a really really fun and impactful project that i'm really happy to say i work on um and yeah oh and i'm also from miami florida and if you can tell from my name or not um i'm very haitian which is a country in the caribbean um yeah awesome cool well um yeah you mentioned this inclusive camera i wonder if you could just tell us what what is it and and just maybe give us a little bit more background about it about it yeah so the inclusive camera is essentially um a way in which uh snap is working to recreate the camera um to work better for folk the camera has unfortunately not worked um inclusively of everyone uh in its history it started off um working for for lighter skin tones because the shirley card and various other uh the surely card which is a color correction card um that folks used to use to go into um photo hut this is way back in like the 1940s and 50s well into our parents and parents uh grandparents um when they used to go develop their photos it was all developed against a photo um of a woman who was white uh and it had the caption normal on it and so if you were never a person who uh who identified as a lighterskinned person um and you went to get your photos developed then they just wouldn't be looking as good as they could be and so that history went on into the digital age and yeah that's what caused us at snap to be able to want to create an inclusive camera which recreates and rewrites the way that cameras are made from the process and software level on to better be able to take a picture of everyone no matter who you are and so there's a little bit of a video that i have to explain this a bit more um well uh well bertrand gets that video ready i just wanted to welcome folks joining from dover delaware pittsburgh sacramento north dakota so good to have people from all over the country joining today i think people of color assume that their skin tones are difficult to photograph because they've seen themselves in lights that are not complementary to how they look and that's absolutely not the case when you look at the camera technology when you look at the history of it when you look at how image making has evolved throughout the years there's some actual technological limitations when it comes to how we show up on screen my name is bertrand sampua and i am the lead for the inclusive camera i've experienced situations where like my skin has been lightened by the camera taking photos of myself and just like it doesn't work especially in low light settings you don't see me so i really want to improve that experience for myself and for the community my mom picking up a phone is assuming that this phone has the best interest for her skin tone and who she is and the photos she wants to take but there's that assumption there that it should be figured out already but it really isn't a lot of times camera companies are registering our skin colors as shadows instead of as skin so it just kind of becomes muddy the inclusive camera is just a camera that allows any person to be seen by the camera the way that they want to be seen the way that they are i love having a balance of like this was made with everybody in mind because that opens up a whole other path of like what creativity could look like when it's actually being made with good purpose you see that saturation that comes in it lifts it a lot it feels like there's a filter on it want every time that you open the snapchat camera to be a moment that you feel as though you can express yourself any way that you want to it's not going to be an easy journey and rebuilding our camera is just the first phase improving low light flash capture and exposure correction so that we can account for all people's skin tones and their undertones so that any person whatever phone they're picking up they're able to take a good selfie and this is just the beginning awesome bertrand thanks for sharing that video um you mentioned your title being a product manager and i feel like that that video showed some of some of your you at work a little bit and so i wonder if you could kind of talk about your role in this project i said you're the lead but what what is like the daytoday what has that process been like of guiding that project yeah so um being a product manager uh pretty much means that like you define the vision of the product and from end to end from the concept of the product all the way to like it being released and even then after you're working with engineers designers and everyone in between to make sure that the product needs to be exactly what it needs to be for the community and especially in this case for the inclusive camera we're like redefining the whole like typical product um development process and so i work with a ton of photographers um someone which some of which you saw i work with like marketing and comms and just various folk to understand and tell like how do we tell the story to the community um and help them understand the product so it's a lot of hats that you get to wear as a product manager you're pretty much like the middle person of everything to make sure that the product is what it needs to be yeah i wonder that's so cool you get to interact with so many different people and like in super collaborative um i think that's something that uh you know students and teachers watching probably hopefully resonate with kind of that collaborative nature of computer science and building something together kind of can make it a fun subject i wonder you know you mentioned the photographers just because we saw them in the video could you talk a little bit about the the contribution um that they you know how did that back and forth go and what was their contribution to the the vision like you said yeah absolutely so um when i when i started this project and pitched it to the to the uh to the team um one thing that we realized was just that like even though we're a camera company and we have a camera team i was on the camera team even before um joining this project that there aren't any photographers on the camera team and so like what does it look like to actually bring those folk in and have them tune our algorithms for us so we created tools for them to be able to like um computational photography tools which is pretty much photography and technology and like how do you build photography into code which is what computational photography is and so we built a bunch of those algorithms and were a few of those algorithms and we we had them go through and tune it in similar to like photoshop like what does it look like for these algorithms to work on different people so we translated what we do is we work with them and they told us like what they would do with the normal dslr camera like the nikon cameras or kodak cameras um and we converted that into code so that our algorithms can work really well very cool um i also know that uh you know in the video i mentioned like some features of like flash correction and things like that like i wonder if you could talk more about some of the specific things that that have come out of this project yeah absolutely and i'm happy to be able to show some as well uh so pretty much one of the things that was just that was mentioned in that video was that we um work with these photographers not just on our algorithms but just to understand like flash capture and how to light people uh in lower light and so one of the features that we released is ring flash so in uh when folks are usually taking a flash if you use snapchat um and you're on the front facing camera and you go and take uh use flash and like it's really dark outside or dark inside or outside and like flashes on your face and you look at yourself like oh my goodness i did not realize that's what i look like um it happens to me all the times or it used to happen to me all the time um until we built ring flash which as i'm trying to share my screen give me this moment um oh we built ring flash which uh essentially illuminates the border around your screen um so that you can better take uh snaps at night and so while bertrand just gets that up uh just teachers out there and students feel free to keep submitting questions in the q a and we'll try our best to get to those uh later in the conversation but happy to submit those so usually when you're taking flash and actually i'm gonna make it darker in here so that y'all can truly see oh my goodness huh and so when it is darker in here and you take the flash i did not really know what i look like and oh this is uh i'll tell you what that is a little bit later but what ring flash does it illuminates the border around your screen so that you can better see yourself while you're taking the snap and so when it's really dark it works much better of course and then what makes it inclusive is that we understand that every person no matter what skin tone they have they have different undertones so no matter your skin tone most folk are have either cool warm or neutral undertones so pretty much a white a warmish red or a foolish blue undertone and so we work with our photographers to find which colors are the best to include in the app and this is a uh a more beta version of the app especially i'm on ios um and so these colors are definitely still being finalized um but the feature is out for the most part on android very cool um bertrand one question we have from uh jonah criner in dover delaware is how it sounds like the project is still ongoing but how long have you been working on it and maybe how long do you see it going going going for yeah so we've been working on this project for almost two years now or a year and a half about a year and a half to two years it's been it's been a long uh a long blurry journey since 2020 um but yeah and i foresee it so the camera is not going to be inclusive overnight um these are just the first features that we're working on and there are many many many more to come it's going to be a long uh longer journey of like honestly i feel as though we can be working on this for easily five years and still have more runway to go um because is it's a process um we're learning how to make that process more and more inclusive and build tools to be inclusive because just the field and area of product inclusion making inclusive product as a whole is very uh un uncharted territory for many companies and many people and so with inclusive camera we're one of the first who are going in and diving deep into building inclusive products and making sure that throughout the whole process there is a diverse group of people that are giving feedback and just uh throughout the whole process and working with the people who are experts and understand these spaces who aren't necessarily always in the tech companies yeah that's uh it's super cool to hear about that work that you all are doing there and um i think yeah some students and teachers who are listening might might kind of resonate with some of that that feedback process of building a feature getting feedback iterating on it working on one feature at a time and also this idea of kind of the empathy for the user and also thinking about who are the users right in an inclusive way um something that you know students who might be in cs discoveries as principals thinking about as they design their work and do their projects in their classrooms um speaking of you know things you might have learned along the way bertrand i'm curious what are some specific cs skills that you've learned that have helped you build the foundation for what you do with your work today yeah um honestly my cis skills uh very much brought me to where i am today so i before i was a product manager i was a software engineer on the camera team at snap and studied computer science in college uh so i have a degree from uh wentworth institute of technology in boston um in computer science and throughout that whole process uh what helped me is just understanding um the fundamentals of technology in general understanding how uh the camera works so i was helping build the foundations and the infrastructure for the camera on our team and i through that i'm really able to speak to our uh our engineering team as an engineer which they fully fully love because not all product managers have that much of an engineering background and so right now when there's when we're working on our computational photography algorithms and going deeper into like how though they work and even speaking about like whether we should or shouldn't use machine learning i'm able to uh speak really deeply with them and understand what they're talking about and vice versa um and so like my computer science background was great because like even on our on our product we are focusing on launching on android first and as an android developer beforehand i was able to understand like why it's so important to be launching on android um because the disparities and how many people are using android around the world compared to ios cool yeah yeah um that's cool to hear about that part of your journey and um bertrand just going back to the what you showed us kind of the demo um there's a question about can you explain a little bit more about this idea of undertones yeah um so at everyone's base level they have their skin tone that's what everybody sees um but every person has like different undertones in the sense of like what when you're taking pictures or wearing clothes what colors do you gravitate more towards or which ones do you realize that look better on you like if there's a backdrop or you're wearing like a blue shirt which one do you which one looks better um and so like under your uh under your skin essentially through your veins you can tell like what your undertones are i believe if your veins are like more bluish you have a cooler undertone if they're like uh more greenish you might have a warmer undertone there's honestly a website that helps you understand all your undertones i do not want to butcher it there um i believe i have cool undertones um and so uh like i look better with the blues um and so it this ranges so like within um black folk it ranges it's not like um black folk or darker skin folk all have blue undertones and lighters can folk all have warm undertones within each skin tone you can be either um and so yeah actually east african folk are more likely to have warm undertones and west african folk are more likely to have blue undertones and even though they're still both african and other similar tone ranges oh cool thanks for sharing about that and that made me think about something i think a quote for you in the video of this like yeah the image of or the vision of you know being able to be seen the way you want to be the way you are the way you want to be seen and so that makes me think about that um there's a question from from the audience about how will you the project account for the situation where there's several people in an image and they have different skin tones and different undertones how how is going to account for all of that absolutely and so that's one of the things where i say that this is going to be a long journey home so right now um we aren't accounting for that as much or um in the sense of just like we are focusing on the selfie camera because 90 of the time it's a single person in the photo and so trying to get that uh working really well and then expanding that to multiple people because i want to be able to take the photos with my friends and my family at the same time the same way i know um everyone uh else on this call would want to as well um so that will be uh definitely to come cool cool well um you know bertrand you know part of your who you are is your work but we'd also love to know a little bit more about you outside of work so what do you enjoy doing outside of work um a few things so uh historically i used to wrestle um was uh but more recently i've been doing a lot of playing music singing and roller skating um so joined a lot of the roller skating craze that's happened in the past year two years very cool uh is this like roller skating for with like tricks or for speed or for like exercise like what is it what kind of started this exercise because i'm really i when i used to get a lot of my exercise from wrestling stop doing that um and don't like running so started with exercise um just for distance but then i started uh dance skating jam skating um and have been doing that ever since which that's pretty much all i do which is even more of in at least for me more of an exercise yeah i'm just roller skating on the beach yeah for sure i've seen i've seen people in groups doing it it looks very intense that's awesome um cool um well bertrand i wonder if we can kind of um i don't know maybe it's tied to your interest maybe maybe not but you know kind of even go back to um like yeah how did you how did you decide to get into this line of work kind of where where where did this interest in computer science um uh come from yeah um so i've always been involved in some level of technology um from when i was younger uh my brothers and i got into it from trying to figure out how to pretty much uh get video games um in a sense through the internet and whatnot um and so that was that helped me like figure out some level of it and actually was my me watching my brothers do it uh and then from there i played actually i'm a huge legend legend of zelda fan and played a ton of video games um but once i got into middle school i like had like a small uh a small instance with it there was like a test for a bunch of subjects and randomly i chose computers just because i was like oh i like computers um and i did pretty well in it but it wasn't until my last semester of high school that i uh took a computer science class with a haitian professor where i went to school in florida and it was completely on a whim i had a class with him my freshman year he was the best professor at the school and i promised him before i left i would take another class with him i had no idea what class that was like literally had no idea and it turned out to be a computer science class that was never ever actually coded um so like before that i was actually planning on studying law um and then i took that class and i switched my like what my plan was completely um then from there um i got into some programs that helped black and hispanic folk um college students into tech code 2040 uh and they were the ones who showed me that like there is a full intersection between our communities the black uh the black and hispanic community into into tech and like you can build your your keep your uh your values into what you build and so since then my values have always been to build dope stuff for dope people and with that increasing folks quality of life through technology and so um inclusive camera is one aspect of that and i can't wait until the future things that i build that are uh definitely going to be in that realm as well very cool i love that saying um another question from the audience kind of related to what you were just saying is what what maybe job internship opportunities did you take of advantage or even kind of projects did you work on um earlier to gain experience to then get to your current role yeah um i say this a ton to people uh because programming is amazing it's fun but sometimes it can be really boring like it can be especially when you're sitting and you're trying to figure out just some homework or something that like was uh just something and like it does it's not working and you want to have something to drive you to actually be doing it um and that's kind of what like pushed me the projects that i built so i figured out that or i wanted to build a music app because i did not want to be in charge of the aux cord um with my friends and like i just it was a whole i was always in charge of the oxford and i was like let me let me let me go to let me sit back and relax and somebody else play the music for once um and so i thought of like what does it look like to create an app where everybody is in charge of the aux cord um and i was building this throughout college and that's how i really really learned how to program because i was building something that i really wanted like something that i was passionate about um and so through that even though i tried failed tried failed and tried again um i was able to learn so much from that project and eventually it was able to to work um spotify then came out with a similar feature so i no longer need this project so that's okay um but uh it was able to work and uh got some used it as like my senior project even though like i started as like my freshman year as a passion project and eventually got some time even at school to work on it as part of my course too um and it really helped me shape what it looks like to uh to code actually and like the practical um the practicalities of programming but also what it looks like to build a product um i think that's some of my first product management experience as well in terms of like defining what the mvp is the most viable product essentially like the base features you need to get this um uh to get this out and go from there building those getting feedback from people showing it to people and doing the whole process yeah that example is uh super powerful and i think hopefully you know students teachers who are listening you know thinking about maybe like well should i try to build that thing that i want to even if you know maybe you don't know how but it sounds like probably when you started out you didn't know how you said you know you failed a lot of times and kept at it but like kind of having that vision in mind and um that product management piece that you mentioned there is probably helpful to have your friends give you feedback on you know whether it was working and obviously yourself were you able to relax uh and and not be in charge of the aux cord so some good feedback streams there for yourself um richard i'm curious if you could talk to us about what obstacles have you faced along your journey and and how have you approached them yeah i would say um honestly one of the major obstacles that i faced uh especially in the beginning of my career was like going from high school to college um i went to a uh i went to school in florida and my parents are really education is everything to haitians parents like everything um and but unfortunately due to circumstance i was didn't have enough scholarships to go to school without uh without taking out any loans and um definitely was not trying to take out any loans uh my parents weren't my parents weren't in favor of loans which i understand that um so i went to community college for a year and that was something that was like uh at least a big step back for me in terms of like not something i was expecting to do i was expecting you to go to state school like my siblings did um like so many of my friends did um all the florida schools fsu if you've ever heard of them they're like really popular schools that like so many of my friends went to um and but unfortunately i went to uh unfortunately at the time honestly it's the biggest blessing ever um that's the point of this um but unfortunately at the time i went to a community college um but i didn't let that like stop my career and so like i was able to um just keep at it be persistent and uh finish my like associates i had some uh some college credits from doing dual enrollment um and finished my associates in a year and it caused me to really be more tenacious and drive what like i really want and understand that like if i really want to be successful as a software engineer in computer science i need to like push and then eventually actually after i finished my my associates i transferred to a school in boston um ended up taking loans but it was definitely half the amount that i would have taken if if i stayed for four years and it's honestly the biggest blessing um because that's where i'm at code 2040 and so a ton of other folks that's very cool to hear and uh appreciate you sharing about that your journey it's not always the uh the linear path that we might have in mind when we're when we're younger but it's obviously where you're at now is doing some super uh impactful and work and work that you're passionate about so um super cool to hear about that and um yeah but that's kind of the time that we have for today so return i want to just say thanks a lot for joining us uh for sharing everything you did uh i really enjoyed getting to hear from you and i hope everyone else out there listening uh also did um thank you to all the teachers and the students who tuned in to listen um just a reminder to the audience remember you can tune into the one more class chat we have later this spring and you can also look back at the past chats if you go to code.org cs journeys and teachers please check your email for a survey as we really appreciate the feedback about these calls as we think about future ones so again thank you bertrand thanks everyone listening and have a great rest of your day everybody thank you
