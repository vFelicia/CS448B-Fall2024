coding is very special to me you got to find a way to look at code you have and fix it so Concepts like not giving up critical thinking being creative their minds can kind of be let free to imagine the unimaginable the partnership with code.org was founded on my own passion and interest in coding and then I knew I could apply it to my elementary students who struggled historically in math I was a senior in high school and my son was born I was a teen dad at 17 I used my position as motivation to go out and get a degree not for myself but for my son I ended up majoring in secondary education with an emphasis in business education at first it was just a job pay the bills I was making good money but kept on thinking about my community back home here and other tribal communities any questions before we get going in the group rather than the individual so me returning back to the community I was raised in is just part of the circle that we talk about always returning to state of Nevada has very low math test scores I knew that we needed to address math either curriculum at the time couldn't be addressed so what I had to do then was kind of step back and say how else can I introduce math concepts and make it fun and engaging I understood that coding and computer science have a correlation and connection to math concepts that's where code.org came in the goal of code.org is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science as part of a basic education and so what our team spends time doing is creating fantastic online courses and training existing teachers in how to begin teaching those courses in their schools we started this campaign called the hour of code the suggestion that you should learn coding for just 1 hour in a classroom and our learning platform now has over 80 million students on it to me coding at heart is about creativity it's about imagining something and then using the language of code to bring your imagination to life I saw how students were engaged and HandsOn from literally day one the best reaction ever is this is easy technically it's not easy but they're making it easy with the rise of artificial intelligence it's more important than ever to teach computer science in schools because AI is going to change everything about our lives everybody should learn this as part of their school education the work of code.org as a nonprofit is only possible thanks to the generosity of philanthropic donations from companies such as Cisco who have helped support our work for many years this same is going to be helping us all day today I work at code.org I'm a product manager for the K through five curriculum my favorite part of my job is when I get to actually come into classrooms and watch what we create in action I developed the star quilt module with a teacher who works on a reservation in Montana and he had showed me the Star Quilts and I was just blown away by how beautiful they were I also saw that it was a really great way to teach students about pattern recognition which is part of the math standards when you look at this star quilt obviously it represents Star right and that star is actually called The Morning Star the most powerful stars in the sky even powerful than the moon more powerful than the sun it represents that crossing over between life and death I saw the Star Quilts draped along the tables and the students had their digital versions of the star quotes on their computers how deep this module actually is um in real life and experiencing the beauty of the actual star quilt alongside the digital version it blew me away I think that sorry I'm going to cry um students I would like you guys to present this um this gift this appreciation of thanks to Amy for um visiting with us uring the work TI is doing with code.org this was a treat I couldn't imagine a cooler way for this thing to come to life that the old and the new come together in a brand new way is absolutely mindblowing it is beautiful it's incredible it's truly a privilege and an incredible feeling to think about the number of children whose lives will be changed thanks to code.org and the work that we've done with all the problems in our world technology is one of the keys to improving the things that we need to solve and teaching students how to create that technology is critical to the lives they want to create for the future coding to me is very very important for any student who wants to continue to pursue some kind of computer science related field so I think it's uh incredible what c.org is doing
