you might already be getting the sense that to make a cool color image you're going to need a lot of bits to do it and looking at a screen full of binary code is hard to keep track of this is an instance where looking at the binary and hexadecimal is quite useful let me set bits per pixel to 12 and then make a single red pixel with all four bits for red turned on 1 one one one and then zero for the green and the blue this is our old friend the red pixel you might remember that the heximal number system has 16 possible digits and that four bits has 16 possible configurations so a single hex digit can be used to represent a 4 bit chunk rather than looking at the raw 12 bits for each pixel we can switch into hex mode and we can see three hex digits that represent the exact same data much easier to look at notice that we now have three digits F 0 0 for the first pixel we know that f is the largest hex digit and represents four bits 1 1 1 1 so working in HEX we're still thinking about mixing red green and blue light but only have to set a single character for each so to turn down the red light I just pick a hex digit less than F let's say seven so 700 is a darker red if I flip the tool back to show binary I can see it's all still there professional Graphics typically use 24 bits per pixel this too is easy to view in HEX and is actually a very common representation you see in web design and in other tools with 24 bits per pixel it means eight bits for each of the red green and blue which means I can set each with two hex digits in this mode red would be FF 000000 and a teal color would be 0 a a a a of course with two hex digits there are 256 different settings for each of the red green and blue lights for a total of 16,777,216 different colors so being able to view and manipulate binary code and heximal is a handy thing to do try it out for yourself and make your own colors
