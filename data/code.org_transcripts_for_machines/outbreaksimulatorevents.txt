Now let's learn about a programming concept called Events. An event tells your program to listen for something to happen, and then react right away. Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click, an arrow button press, or atap on the screen. We use events all the time as humans, when we respond to different signals. When I'm walking down the street, and see someone else walking towards me, I check to make sure I'm wearing my mask correctly. When we develop a simulation, we create a series of rules. For this simulation, we'll code this rule When a healthy monster touches a sick monster, the healthy monster will become sick. Here is a "when touches" event. Click the small blue plus sign here, on this block. It will show 2 new blocks called Subject, and Object. Drag the purple monster block, into the code below it. This code is telling the computer that when a healthy monster meets a sick monster, the healthy monster will change its costume, to look like a sick monster. Click "run" to watch your simulation play out. Run your program a few times, and observe the differences.
