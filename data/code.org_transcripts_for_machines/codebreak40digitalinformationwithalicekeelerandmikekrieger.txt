hi everybody and welcome to code break we're all here together and together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom last week we had thousands of viewers between zoom and facebook uh all together we had almost 15 000 people joining us at and we're hoping to build a larger and larger audience each time so as you join if you enjoy what we do on code break please invite other families other students friends to join us as well i'm here at org headquarters and just kidding i'm here in my living room because nobody's going to their headquarters and i'm joined by my daughter in sidekick sophia hello sophia's going to manage our sounds as as we go along and today we have two very special guests uh the first i want to introduce is alice keeler alice and is mike krieger on already hello hi mike how are you doing doing great so mike is one of the two cofounders of instagram how are you today been really well thank you good to be here where are you joining us from from california from stinson beach since beach california um and uh any thoughts you want to share with all the students who are at home while school is closed well i'm very excited to be here with all of you um it's really inspiring to see this many folks interested in learning more on how to code i'm excited for the the lesson we have ahead uh i think we'll have some some fun doing doing the the exercise and yeah i think it's a i think back to when i was learning to code i was born and raised in brazil so imagine me in brazil with a book that's all i had at the time there was no real you know internet access to coding classes and to go from that to now being able to meet other people who are also interested in the same thing and have all the the classes online i think is is really an interesting opportunity for people to to pursue their curiosity all right so we'll be thank you and yeah it's been a major difference when i started learning as well when i was i started when i was nine years old in tehran iran very very different experience than now um so mike we're going to be building an app uh in the second half of the show but i want to switch to talking with alice briefly alice how are you doing hey i'm good it is beautiful weather out here in california so both of you are in from california um and alice is a superstar teacher who uses technology in her classroom can you tell us a little bit more about uh they see the work that you do absolutely i started teaching math in 1999 i have a degree in math and i inherited the laptop algebra program so my whole teaching career has been helping kids learn math using computers and i've also written some books for teachers i wanna have five kids you have five kids that's wonderful um so i'm like with everybody else i'm home with my family and my daughter sophia joins us every week um partly to learn herself uh partly to keep me in check um and she also has her app to make sound effects so she's my daughter student cohost and also part of the production crew and we're going to start today with the computer joke of the day so sophia you want to ask the computer joke question why was the computer late for work all right mike alice any ideas i got nothing because it had a hard drive my daughter's wanting to drive right now and believe me it's hard sophia is not happy about having to tell these bad jokes um let's get a chance to meet our our audience we have dozens of students on camera so uh we've switched to gallery view so if everybody could wave and say hello there's a whole audience that's also joining us from that's not on camera and i want to switch to screen share to see where these folks are from so i'm going to share my screen to we did a geographic poll as people were joining that other people in california with us yeah some uk wow folks looks like all the way over in india and maybe parts of china and thailand antarctica good coding cutting uh opportunities there yeah so besides saying i mean by the way it's crazy that there's people in china in in eastern china or in hawaii i'm not sure what time zone in hawaii it's i think 7 a.m in china it's well after midnight i believe let's also to learn more about the audience i want to get a sense of what grade people are in so if we could put up an audience poll for people to enter their grade band so we get a sense of the different age groups so whether it's in the elementary school high school it's kind of like it was first all out high schoolers we've got a lot of third and fifth grade students joining us today which i have a fourth grader awesome kinder all age groups yeah everybody you share the polls everybody can see them all right so our biggest group is third fourth and fifth graders but we have a little bit of a spread from all over now no matter what group you're in it's never too late to learn computer science so even if or too early whether you're in your 70s and joining us or whether you're a beginner or whether you're younger there's different skill levels so let's do another poll just get a sense of the different skill levels of people whether you're a beginner intermediate or advanced and if everybody could just submit so we get a sense of that intermediate users got some pressure good it's my first zoom pole it's very cool to see the votes come in live yeah this is similar to most zoo meetings but the the audience that's in the background that we have to do extra work to make sure they they get a sense a chance to interact as well if we could share these results on screen as well um it's not intermediate it's across all across the range and i want to say for the folks who are beginners we're going to start at beginner level stuff and get more advanced please stick with us even if things go a little bit over your head or more than what you're used to learning you'll always be able to keep up with something and if you're more advanced uh we'll try to make it interesting even at the early parts of the episode uh and by the later parts we'll be doing some fun stuff one of the most exciting parts is we're gonna be recreating one of the features of instagram live and code uh with the cofounder of instagram which should be pretty interesting as we're going along if you're in the audience that isn't on camera you can at any point to ask a question by clicking the q a button if you're on a touch screen you may need to tap the screen to see this button show up the team at code.org is going to be answering questions live so at any point if you're whether it's a question about this episode or just a generic computer science question feel free to use that and we'll take some of the best questions to ask of either mike or alice or myself uh in the middle at the end of the show we have three parts to today's episode uh we're gonna start by learning about images and pixels as part of learning about digital information then we're going to learn about color pixels and then we're going to build a feature of instagram ourselves live and as we go we may have bugs that happen and we're going to learn about a computer science concept called debugging this is our fourth time doing this so there may always be problems um sophia's got a little bug that she's painted so if we run into technical issues as we are sure to do we'll debug them and figure them out on the fly so please please be patient with us before we go into the today's lesson on digital information one thing i want to do is i want to welcome students to demo their creations so last week we learned about encryptions and secret messages and each week when you share your creations we're going to invite some of the best ones on next week's episode uh so this week we want to invite anna anna are you there with us yeah i'm here hi hi there anna so last week we learned about making a password generator and anna submitted the coolest more advanced password generator of all the students participating um so i'm gonna screen share to show but you can say hi to to mike and alice while i turn on my screen share to show your app and i'm excited to see this thanks anna where are you calling from rochester new york rochester new york so this is anna's password generator so you can choose how many words you want in a password and if i click you know this is a three word password so for game near uh you can make so anna can you walk me through one of the features that you added to this to make it more uh yeah so um one of the things i noticed was that in the original app you could end up with the same word twice in a password so i added a feature to remove that so the default is now you can only have each word once but you can choose to have it more than once and then i also added in number substitutions for some letters so e is substituted with three o and zero and things like that i guess what would this be so yeah that would be oh the one is i so that would be wild tried pure and it says underneath oh no nice how did you get the possible passwords down there um so when you're i used a factorial so when you are reusing the words it's just the exponential um but then when you're not allowing the usable words it was the number of words factorial divided by the number of words in the password factorial all right cool that's pretty cool all right so thank you so much anna um i'm going to stop the screen share for a second uh and i also want to introduce uh students that are basically working in our classrooms doing computer science principles so computer science principles is the most popular high school computer scores in the nation students are learning anything everything from how the internet works to cyber security to learning how to program and build your own app and in the programming units one of the things that these cs principal students are learning is how to use coding to create complex scenes and we've done this before with the code.org artist tool but what the high school students are doing are making much more complicated scenes and we ask high school students from all around the country to submit their creations uh there were a lot of really good ones so it was hard to choose the ones to highlight but i'll i'll quickly screen share to show some examples of these so what you see here is basically at five different creations uh this rainbow here with uh and then this sort of thing and then this uh these hot air balloons in the city these are all from different students around the country and these may look like drawings you could make with a pen or or so on but in every one of these cases they're using computer programming commands like the rainbows are parts of a circle or the little cactuses have little lines or so on the one i want to go into more is this one that kira made so cara's gonna join us uh cara are you there have we unmuted you yet yeah i'm right here all right so this is patient where are you from i live in rockville maryland awesome i'm going to reload this so we can see that looks nice outside there yeah sun's shining so this is the the drawing that your code makes if we look at the actual code for this uh there's quite a lot going on all those for loops many hundreds of lines of code but one thing i was looking through your code i noticed basically these are this right here is the code to draw the stars and 300 stars each at a random location and some of width 0.3 and then you draw some you draw some bigger stars and then some straw smaller stars at which with 0.2 um and then even smaller stars so as the code runs as a whole sort of different levels of stars being drawn so each time you run this code you basically see a different night sky because the positions and locations of the stars or buildings are randomized which is kind of cool i really like the comet getting thicker as it goes along too so thank you i think that was definitely the most complicated part because i ended up using circles with radii that were increasing incrementally and it was very difficult to get the position so that it was like arced the way that it does so i think that was definitely the most laborintensive part of the code but it's also the most satisfying to see when you run it again and again yeah it looks very cool totally i'm just noticing how many of these functions you have with the positions i'm thinking that had to take in a really long time to figure out where all of the numbers are the between yeah it was a lot of trial and error for sure but eventually you kind of noticed patterns with how far you need to move as you increase the radii and you decrease the distance between the points so it got faster as i worked more and more awesome all right well thank you so much kyra and hope you're doing well in maryland uh so today's episode what we're going to learn about is digital information so our special word of the day where is my special word of the day is two words of the day there are two words is digital information and if you notice i colored the eyes and the o's differently because digital information is stored in ones and zeros computers use ones and zeros to represent information and we're going to learn today about three different things and we're going to start with images and pixels so ones and zeros can be used to represent numbers and there's a bunch of math that goes behind that they can be used to represent letters colors sounds but today what we're going to learn about is how ones and zeros are used to represent images and and photos now if you look at the ones and zeros you don't need to think about the math just think about the ones and zeros as lights if you look at the monitor on your screen every little dot on your screen is effectively a light and it can be on or off and in fact the reason we use ones and zeros is because the electricity in a computer can be on or off like a light bulb so when it's a one it's on when it's a zero it's off and so inside a computer there's wires and basically the ones and zeros turn those wires on to have voltage are off to not have voltage that's also what's happening on the screen of your computer as well so every little dot on your screen can be on or off and in fact if it was a purely black and white screen all we would need is ones and zeros to represent what's going on there and so what we're going to do is a funky little exercise where the actual students on camera are themselves going to be individual pixels as part of an image at this is something we've never tried before and it's a setup that's kind of funky so we're going to switch into a gallery view where we see 20 or so of us all on camera all at the same time uh this is going to take a little bit of setup to do because different screens that students are going to be on whether you're on a mobile phone or so on might be slightly different and we have a funky set up to try to get everybody basically to see the same 20 students all at once so right now we all see the same screen of 20 students whether you're on a mobile phone whether you're on an ipad etc um just so you know how we're doing this is pretty complicated what what's happening behind the scenes is there's somebody who's using a phone to capture a picture of zoom and then streaming back from that phone back into zoom so we see all the same things um so what we're gonna do everybody on camera uh do you all have a piece of paper like a white piece of paper and can you hold up your white piece of paper so when you hold up your white piece of paper this is like you're holding a one it's like there's a light on your screen and the light is on and we have everybody holding that piece of paper up except i think sophia we don't see yours in akira we don't see yours right so that's everybody holding up a one now let's turn off our pieces of paper and everybody hold the zero which take your pieces of paper down so uh now what i want to do which we haven't really practiced or tried before but what we want to do is try to spell something so let's try to spell a c uh so depending on where you are on the screen see if you want we want to spell a letter c along the top and sides yeah along the top and then the left side but the middle shouldn't so ryan drop your piece of paper because you're sophia you should hold up a piece of paper rise on can you hold up your piece of paper and jj if you could drop yours if you hold yours closer up there there you go this is kind of a letter c and you can imagine this letter c if this was a screen some of the some of the dots in the screen are white some of them are black and whether they're white or black depends on whether they're ones or zeros let's see if we can make a letter o so the folks on the right side can you hold up your pieces of paper too and everybody else who was in the sea keep it up still so sasha patrick caleb put yours down jj there we go so depending on whether we have these pieces of paper up or down uh basically we can show different things on the screen so one thing we want to do is basically now try sending a pattern of ones and zeros to everybody who's on the screen so that we're gonna we're gonna copy and paste into the chat room a pattern of ones and zeroes so uh hannah if you're in the background there can you can you all if you look at the chat there's a bunch of ones and zeros for different people in the first row to hold a one then a zero then a one then a zero in the second row to hold a zero then a one then a zero then a one don't hold it up yet what i wanna do is have a poll of the audience who's not on the screen if you can look in the chat the code for what's going to be displayed is one zero one zero zero one zero one one zero one zero zero one zero one one zero one zero and the question is what is what is the pattern that this is gonna create so if we do a poll of the whole audience is it going to be a smiley face or a flower or a star or a checkerboard let's see the audience guesses we have a whole bunch of different guests people get different things you're not sure about the code you can click on the chats to see the different options all right uh about half the audience has already voted and the guesses are all over the map but i think a lot of the students have figured it out but not everybody has figured it out um can we share the poll results look at that checkerboard checkerboard actually we should have done it with your results can you hide the poll results and let's basically if you're in the if you're on the people on screen you see from your row what you should be doing uh so if you um so in the first row basically find your name in that row and then hold up your one or the zero depending on what you are or whether it's a one or a zero and i'm going to paste these values in the chat window again there we go so we sort of see a checkerboard we're almost at checkerboard i think rosie somebody's got some ones or zeros off but anyway so that's about as close as we can get to doing pixel photography with people on a zoom call uh and if you share the poll results again basically the audience guessed it that the the pattern of ones and zeros makes a checkerboard but it would have been really cool if we could have had a flower or star um so that was basically how ones and zeros can be used to represent digital photography um and we learned now how a bit of a one or zero can represent basically black or white but you know most pictures are not black or white so let's talk about how we can use pixels to represent color and we're going to basically do this with with i'm going to show a slide presentation about how this works but alice do you alice or mike do you have any ideas about how we can represent colors using just zeros and ones well sometimes if you if you go i don't know if it works on these computers but when you go oldschool computers you got really really close you would see that there was actually not just one little dot uh on every little row but actually three little dots on every little row yes since i like to do html i'm guessing it has to do with the rgb color code which i never fully knew what that was but i use it so that's what we're gonna learn right now so this is actually a zoom in of an old school monitor on old school computers if you got close enough with a magnifying glass you'd actually see little lights for red green and blue so even though the colors on the screen might be white or gray each of the little dots on the screen had three little lights and each one of these lights can have information storing what color or how bright that light is now if you had only one uh bit of information a zero or one for each light you could have the red be a one and what you'd see in that dot is all red or if the blue is a one you'd see all blue or if the green is the one you'd see all green what would happen to your favorite yeah but what would happen if two of these were a one you'd get them mixed like red and green together is yellow is that what you've learned in school too sophia no no no yeah usually red and green is like this kind of what color would that be brown or mustard or something i mean i've been to art class but it depends on the shade like if it's really a close enough shade it can make yellow yeah the thing is in art class you're mixing paint so when you mix multiple colors it gets darker in computer science you're actually mixing light so when a red and a green light are both on it gets more bright the more lights you have on the more bright it is and red plus blue usually with paint is purple but in computers it becomes pink or blue plus green becomes cyan and what happens if you mix red and blue and green together with paint you just get mud but with light you get perfectly white whiteness so when all the lights are on it's white and when all of them are off it's black so with three bits of information red blue and green you can represent four colors based on whether they're all zero or one just one of them is on and then if you have the mixtures you can have multiple different colors on so what we're going to do for the entire audience is we're going to give you a chance to each come up with your own pixel and submit it into a shared screen where we're all going to see the pixels people suggest so basically if you could go to this url bit dot lee code codepixel or if you have a phone use the phone's camera to scan this qr code over here what's going to happen when you do that is what you do when you click that url is going to see a google form and inside this google form basically what you're going to see is you can submit your name and you can submit three individual pixels your red value your green value and your blue value and we'll actually see all the values that people submit from all around the uh all around the world and then what we're going to do is we have a spreadsheet that's going to actually combine these so that each one of the pixels individually gets converted into colors and then we're actually going to lay them out like the dots on a screen on a computer screen to actually make a picture that's combining all the pixel pixels submitted from students all around the country now i'm going to stop my screen share briefly as we do this and switch to show a spreadsheet that actually does this as people are submitting their values wait dad your shirt it's like pixels yes that's pretty funny when i was getting dressed this morning sophia knew that we were going to talk about pixels today so that's how we decided what to wear today so we have that spreadsheet that people submitted their information to about google forms is that it's so easy to get information from a lot of people all into one place quickly so i'm going to switch to my google spreadsheet i'm a little worried because this spreadsheet has had so many people submitting to it all at the same time that i'm not sure if it's even going to work but it doesn't it's a bug but if it doesn't it's a bug we'll find out it's it won't actually be a bug it'll just be that my computer is too slow so here's a spreadsheet with people submitting their names and their pixels to it and it's so laggy that i can barely even load it in time but you can see pixels gradually coming in as students are submitting that your individual pixels whoa look at all that that's so cool so those are all the ones and zeros that everybody submitted from all around the world and what we've done is we've added conditional formatting which is a feature in excel so each person is submitted when you get a zero one one or a one one one and it's making one big monitor and by the way we haven't tested this before because we didn't have a thousand students to try this so i'm very happy that it actually worked i can scroll down there's more yeah there's a lot of pixels coming in as people are submitting us isn't it fun when you build something and it works on the very first try that never happens yeah exactly um one thing that's cool here is the black ones you can't see the numbers there but those are zero zero zero uh alice can you tell me how i could actually see the zero zero zeros there that's actually the fun so if you go in and change the font color to white so i like to use the conditional formatting where i set the font color and the fill color to be the same so i wouldn't see the numbers but in this case because we do i would set a contrasting color so yeah depending on what's in the cell what color to make it so it says if the cell contains zero zero zero it colors it black and i can say if it's zero zero zero i'll change the font to be white and i say done now we should see all the black ones you should see the zeros show up in them but of course because there's so many cells being calculated all at once yeah it's calculated i have a spreadsheet so much of this which i did all minecraft style and the same thing it takes a little bit for it to upload but there it goes all right well that was pretty cool everybody got to submit their own pixel and we all made a beautiful photo of i don't know what it's like it's just as hard to recognize as our checkerboard or see but but what you realize is how these little digital pieces of information can be used to create a photo on the screen and if you now look at your screen and you see my face or you see alice or mike every time you look at a computer screen like if you look at the green behind alice uh alice can you talk so we can see the green oh yeah this is my uh my wall at my house every little dot on that screen that's green is because there's enough ones to turn on the green lights on her monitor to be on and the red lights and the blue lights are zeros to be off every single time you see a photo on instagram there's a whole bunch of ones and zeros turning on little lights there's literally more than a million dots on the screen so more than 10 million ones and zeros coloring every single image and when there's a video happening at 30 frames a second billions of times little ones and zeros are turning on and off lights on your monitor to actually change what's what you see on the screen it's kind of crazy that there's billions per second of changes in ones and zeros to turn on lights but that's basically how all computer videos and and computer photos are displayed um alice can you tell us about how else you've used maybe basically technology like this in classrooms for teaching yeah absolutely i even use something very similar to this with pixel art because i love pixels and when you make a google drawing and you go into resize it i always like to reset it to pixel sizes because that's the width of your screen so pixels are a great way for students to create and be um show what their learning is in a more fun way so i use alaska.com pixel art which allows them to select uh with numbers they just like pink by number and i every day i have students sending me what they've been creating because we want students to create and pixels are one way that students can show what they've learned wonderful and in fact in one of the challenge assignments we're going to send to students at the end of this episode includes uh some some work that you could do with a different tool for making pixel arts but it'll be very similar um alice there's a lot of students at home and also teachers as well do you have any message to share with folks who are basically home by themselves studying during this protracted period of who knows how long school is closed yeah that's a great time though to learn something new and you're not set at a bell schedule right now is that you can take some time to say like i want to learn how to code some images in instagram and it takes some time like i don't always get it right the first time so i it's just an opportunity to kind of breathe and have the time to explore things you're excited about thank you so much uh yeah we've been spending a lot of time while we're at home it's our spring break right now in in seattle but sophia has been doing a lot of coding but also a lot of other stuff as well sophia what have you been doing while you've been at home i mean now that i think of it i can't really decide but i've done a lot of arts and crafts a lot of arts and crafts yeah you do any minecraft actually yes actually she's done a little bit of minecraft but we actually i we limit our screen time so we do more coding and creativity when we're on computers and less video games because encode in minecraft i'm just saying minecraft that's true um i want to switch to see if we have any um we have some questions from the audience uh so regan b uh said what is a factorial uh alice do you want to answer that question great question so when you want to multiply the same thing uh say 5 factorial so it's 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1. so where that comes into play is when you're doing permutations so i have five people and i pick a liter well now i need to take that leader out and now i have four people and i pick the second person so i take that person out and so i'm looking for how many ways i can take these five people and put them in line so you multiply them together is a great practical application for factorials and you would write it as like five with an exclamation mark so in her code each letter has 26 options so 26 factorial would give you uh 26 for the first a letter 25 for the second letter just generating up those numbers and then there's a question from molina a teacher in los angeles saying as we all adjusted teaching from whom many of us teachers have directed our students to code break what advice do you have for teachers adjusting to remote learning and bringing their students to today's call or to remote learning in general well my favorite is to be collaborative i mean this is times where we can't be together so looking for tools that allow us to be together so i love everyone on the same spreadsheet or everyone on the same google slides and if you're a microsoft teams user the teams chat is just a great way to interact and focus on ways that we can be together when we can't yeah one thing i also recommend is just spending a little bit of time this these moments aren't just about education but also about a little bit of inspiration and community because everybody's stuck dealing with just their mom or dad or brother or sister and not getting enough time seeing regular people so just a little bit of time to connect and ask how are you doing and how's your day uh can go a long way and it's a good time to recognize that school isn't just about math and reading you can learn all sorts of things like learning to play a new musical instrument reading a book that you thought was too hard to understand there's so many things we can learn during this time um alice thank you so much for joining us we're halfway through this episode and want to go on to the next stage but could we switch to gallery view and have everybody say goodbye to alice and sophia's going to play an applause sound for you hi alice hi thanks for having me all right uh mike thank you for uh sitting through the first half of the show we want to talk now about your work um so you were born in brazil like you mentioned earlier what brought you to the united states yeah so brazilian brazil uh i was there until um i was 18 and um at the time there was not a lot of um computer science and startup sort of uh education in brazil that's really changed now but at the time i was really interested in in programming and and decided to come to the us because at the time that was where you know i could come and learn um so that was the big leap um but it's been exciting actually in the last few years to see so many coding schools and other things appear in brazil a lot of interest from people there too now yeah so you and i are both immigrants and many american entrepreneurs are immigrants but when it comes to technology and computer science you don't see a lot of successful latino americans in tech or in computer science what was it like going through studying computer science at stanford and starting your own company being from south america well i think you know i think role models are really important role models and mentors and one of the things that was hard for me was there weren't just that many other latinos other brazilians who were you know have been doing that so um one thing i try to do now is when there are people in brazil who are trying to start something or trying to learn i'm really excited to help them because i think if you see somebody that you know you know or who has the same background as you do something it's a lot more helpful and it can be inspiring um so i have a question about instagram how did the idea for instagram come about and what was it like creating it in the early days were you what were you doing what like right before that happened uh where were you and your cofounder kevin can you tell us a little bit about the story of the creation of instagram yeah so i was before instagram i was working at a startup called mebo it's not around anymore but it let you basically chat on your computer uh back when like aol instant messenger way before most of your times but you know that was where we were mostly chatting uh before text messaging uh and i was there and i was you know coding and doing some design but then met up with my friend kevin and he was really interested in doing a company and i was too and uh i think you know sometimes people think startups like just happen in like a light bulb but it actually was a lot of sort of trying one thing seeing so we definitely went through a lot of different you know attempts that like should work like this now that doesn't work should it work like that um and so it was a lot of trying things out seeing if they worked it took us almost a year to really get to the idea of instagram but the idea of instagram came from trying a lot of other ideas and kind of narrowing down from there got it and did you expect it to be one of the world's largest social networks in history when you're starting it out not at all we were you know really trying to do something that we thought was cool that we wanted to use and uh you know if you asked me to guess how many people would use it ever maybe i would have said if we're really lucky like a million people will use it um and so it was really amazing to see it grow that's awesome uh yeah similarly when we started code.org in the hour of code we we kicked off the hour of code with the goal of getting 10 million students to do the hour of code in one week and in fact when we said that we're like if we ask for 10 million students we might get 1 million yeah first week we had 20 million students uh and we've now in the six years the hour of code has been around we just passed 900 million hours of code being done which has been incredible to say that incredible there's another thing i wanted to ask you because people talk about you know when you see stories or movies about people creating things there's a lot of talk about like the special moment of genius like light bulb moment did you all have a light bulb moment where like everything came together like we're going to create instagram and it's going to have stories and this and that so to us it was a lot more about sort of figuring one thing out and then trying it and then like going to the next one we did have the moment though where uh we named it which was kind of a light bulb moment so uh you know it was just called code name we didn't even it was just you know we didn't have a name for it yet and i remember i mean my cofounder had a uh two like word documents open with a bunch of like starts of words and ends of words so like insta pic like that doesn't sound that good uh you know like cool pick and then all of a sudden we made insta and gram and we're like whoa that that's pretty good so we decided to go with that and it works in portuguese too like instagram and it works in a lot of languages which is important sometimes when you're naming things so that was our like okay let's go with instagram let's like stop looking at this text file let's get back to building it but the actual coding takes a lot of hard work and grit and late nights more than random strokes of genius i suspect exactly and you know and you it's you never know if something's going to work until you try it both on the coding side but also just on you know seeing if some people are going to enjoy it and use it so you just have to you know keep keep at it what about instagram meter resonates so much when people already had facebook and twitter and and sort of other social media outlets i think because it's so visual so you know it was so international even from the beginning like when i when we started instagram my family was still in brazil and but through instagram i made friends in japan i made friends in europe i made friends everywhere and got to know people's lives just because you don't have to speak the language you just have to see the photo and i think that was something different and new uh back then and i think continues to be something that people really like is the like the fact that it's not really that much about what you write it's just about what you see and what you share so speaking about what you see we want to switch to the last stage of our lesson yeah pixels but now we're going to code a feature of instagram uh and when you're coding something like instagram how much are you worrying about the individual pixels or actually not even the pixels the ones and zeros are you dealing with i want to turn that one on and that one off or is it is it easier than doing that yeah so the the good news is you know i think in the early days people really were saying like turn this pixel on turn this pixel off and luckily now we're at a level you know we call it abstraction where you can like go up a level and and uh tell the computer what you want it to do rather than worrying exactly how it's going to do it so when we were writing things on instagram for example the you know different image editing and filters and drawing you know you're usually saying all right computer or you know xcode or ios i want you to draw a line from here to here a lot like uh the stars that we saw earlier in the comment so that's exactly what we're going to do next what we're going to create is an image doodler which is one of my favorite features of instagram sophia do you use instagram no why not because i'm too young because you're not allowed to that's right instagram but uh if you were old enough to use instagram one of the most popular features is if you take a photo you can doodle on it and draw on it just do that if you go to edit you can do that in camera as well um actually the last feature i uh i wrote code for on instagram was the drawing tool oh that's pretty awesome well i should be able to help here that's so awesome that was basically the last thing you did on instagram and now we're gonna do it again in the next 15 minutes it probably took you longer than 15 minutes it's more work to do something at that scale but we're going to screen share a tool on code.org called app lab and this is basically the tool that we use for prototyping apps and last week we used it to create a password generator this week we're going to create an image doodler uh here's an image i've chosen but we have actually four choices of screens we can choose to doodle on one is flowers we also have a beach and then we also have a bird and then we also have a cat uh this cat is special because it's sophia's cat sunshine his name is mr sunshine and we want to choose which image to doodle on so before we actually write the code can we run a live poll for the audience to choose which of these four images we choose between i already know what's cats are very big on instagram cats are very big on instagram yes sophia's pretty excited because she was hoping her cat would get selected i think you'll like this is this is trending in a good direction here cat and beach are kind of duking it out uh but i think because we're speaking we have a little bit of an advantage here on the cat side all right can we show the poll results all right so you wanted the cat so that's what we're gonna go with um so i'm gonna make this the default screen for our app so when we start the app that's what we see and now we're going to go into the code for this so when we want to make the code for an image doodler what we're going to use is we're going to use the the turtle commands in the app uh but you know what's fun is i learned to code when i was 12 or 13 using logo which was the sort of grandfather of the turtle tool so that was really you know it's been helping people learn to code for a long time exactly so the turtle tool lets you basically say things like move forward move backward moves to this an x and y location and it draws as you get there but we want to know we want to make it follow along as our mouse does this so i'm going to add an event handler first so i'm going to say when an event happens and the event that i'm going to look for is on this on the cat screen anytime there's any movement of the mouse of any sort so when the mouse moves at any point we're going to have the turtle move to that point and what point do we deal with i'm going to put the variable here so the event handler and i'm going to have us move to dot x and event dot y in past versions of code break we learned about events it's like an event like a button click but with a mouse move event we actually get an event x and an event y so when i hit run on the screen you can see as i move the mouse it should be drawing although i'm not sure why it isn't maybe it's because my computer's not enough it's a bug is it a bug do we need to debug this i didn't expect to be developing this right now why is it drawing to a weird place on the screen i must have misspelled something oh i didn't do move two i didn't move that's i'm going to draw this again so i thought i was going to move that that far away from where it's from the center of the screen so it was going really far and all right so i'm using the move blocks now when i hit run as i move mouse i can see a bunch of doodling happening it took literally three lines of code and a few seconds of debugging to make this but there's a few problems with this first of all you can see the little arrow of this little turtle guy and i don't want that to be showing up and then the second thing is i can't stop doodling i'm not holding my mouse down it's just doodling whatever i do so there's a couple of things i want to do first i'm going to stop this code and first i'm going to use the hide block to hide that little triangle uh and i'm also going to set the pen color uh what color should i start this as blue i like blue all right well sophia clearly likes blue um but the other thing i want to do is i want to make sure so that the pen doesn't start as drawing so i'm going to start with the pen up so now when i hit run it doesn't do anything when i move around the mouse and what i want to do is when i hit the mouse down i want it to draw so only when i have a mouse down event so when the cat screen gets a mouse down event and we're going to be done real soon with a very basic image doodler when the cat screen gets a mouse down event i'm going to first move to that location i'm using the move to block correctly this time and i'm going to move to that location just like before event dot x and event dot y and the other thing i'm going to do is put the pen down when that happens and the other there's another thing i need to do so that's what happens when the mouse goes down what should i what is there something else i'm missing mike do you want to help me out okay got done you got to move to that place put the pen down and then you also need to handle the mouse up exactly mike did not know i was going to call on him for something like that so mouse up and when i have the mouse up what should i do uh you want to do pen up yeah so basically now we have a situation i don't need the event there because i don't need the x and y so now if i move around the mouse nothing happens but if my mouse is down i'm drawing and when my mouse is up i'm not drawing and my mouse is clicked down i'm drawing again and so on so we can do more interesting stuff to our doodler as well so i want to add some other features what are some of the features that image doodlers have that are that are fun we got to pick a color we could pick a color so i'm going to let us choose between three different colors so i'm going to add buttons to help us choose colors so this will be button one and button two and button three and we'll have three colors to choose i'll let sofia choose one of them and then mike to choose one and then the audience can choose a third color sophie what do you want is the color for your first button blue again blue yes all right so that's a good blue that's a good blue and i'll take this text off so it doesn't say button right mike what do you want for the next button uh let's make it red red that's a pink sort of bacon that's pretty good red and i'll take get rid of the text on this one and now let's do an audience poll so the audience can choose the color for the next button so can we put the poll on the screen of the the different color options i think we have color options queued up for a poll if we don't you have a chat all right we don't have the call options ready um so why don't we use a show of hands um we're gonna have a choice between uh we're gonna choose between green and yellow if you want the the button to be green click the raise hand button it looks like this if you can see this and we're going to count how many people raise their hands well it looks more like this so you need to click the raise hand button to see oh my god my screen is getting filled with people raising their hands i can't see anything all right i saw so many raised hands which color you guys see if you want i think this is great all right we're gonna go with green i can't even see what's going on my screen anymore because zoom has covered it with ray's hand buttons lower your hands please do we have all the hands lowered and i'm going to try to change this to green all right so this third button is green so now we have red blue and green buttons and i'm also going to change the text of this to not be button so we have these three buttons now having the buttons isn't enough to actually change the color of our doodler so now we actually need to write the code for doing this as well so for doing this now we need to actually go back into code mode and we need to write the code for what happens when any of these buttons are clicked so what i want is when i hit run if i click the blue button or if i click the red button it should change this to be red colored so how can i do that can you help me out here mike i think yeah so what we're going to want to do is add a new event handler and when you handle each button event we're going to set the pen color to each different um each different color all right so button 2 which is the blue one is gonna go and say set the pen color button two is blue and then i'm going to go on event when button three is pressed and by the the numbers of these buttons when i hover over and it shows me that this is button three and that looks like your video might have frozen so i don't know if you can uh stop and reshare to have it pop up again thank you i will do that i will stop the share thanks so much of course if you want to hold up the bug button to show that we're debugging we don't have it okay there we go thing is one button two is clicked when button three is clicked when each one of these buttons gets clicked we're gonna change the pen color so when button three is clicked we're going to choose pen color red and when button four is clicked and by the way this may look like we're adding a lot of code but it's so much less code to do it than i'm sure when you were doing it in instagram in xcode to be able to just say change the button the pen color color exactly all right and green all right so now we have so now we can click run and it defaults to blue and i can click red and now i got red perfect and green as well i want to add one more feature which is to let you choose the width of the doodler because as i was doodling it's kind of hard to let's add see slider you want to use a slider sofia so we'll put a slider to change the width uh and i'm gonna make it a bigger slider so we can it goes all the way across so and this slider basically will have a value that it shows um so where did my screen go i think my screen share just stopped again should i get my bug no you think we're okay with that um so now what we want to do is when the slider changes we change the pen width as well and this again is really simple so we're going to do another on event handler and mike you haven't seen how this works but i'm going to pull an on event yeah this is new this is new and when we say the slider the slider is what's going to generate the event and the question is what events do you think we're going to look for uh probably change so i'm going to look for the change event on the slider so when the slider changes and that's a good guess um now we're going to go to the turtle and change the pen width of the turtle and when the slider gets a change we don't want to change the value to three we can basically find out the value of the slider by saying getting the text oops it looks like you froze again on the video can i fuse again just a share oh no this is a tough one i think i should get that later thank you so much for calling up this doesn't happen usually when we do this i'm not sure why it's happening now all right can you see it now uh i can see it now great so we're getting the text from the and width to the value in the slider so if the slider is low we just have one value and if it's high we have another value so if i get the text from the slider now when i hit run i can set the slider to a big width and now i get her and if i have a small width i have a small doodle i can switch to green and have a small doodle and i can switch to a big width and have a big doodle um so we basically have an image doodler now you might not want the value to be big so there's lots of bugs in this thing that we created so far but this is the basics of an image doodler and it's one of the most popular features in instagram and it took only about 20 lines of code to create what's particularly cool about this is we can now share this out and i can click send to phone and so if any of you are at home and have a phone as well you can look at this qr code that you see on the screen and if you hold out your phone with your camera and scan that qr code the app that we just created your on your camera you should see a little bubble at the top of your phone and you can actually see a link and then literally the app that kept that we just wrote together right now mike and i and sophia can now be on your phone and you can actually do your own image and it should work on android or ios phones mike are you doing it yep there it is sophia's cat is now in the hands of hundreds of students um the really cool thing about this is that we wrote this code just now we created it and every one of you can now start image doodling but that image doodler that we have is missing a lot of features what are some features mike that you think students can add to it oh um let's see um there's always more colors um what else could they do um they could thicker stickers are a great idea yeah could do stickers you could let the the pen change colors while you're drawing that would be a really fun advanced feature oh like so like it becomes a rainbow kind of it becomes a rainbow we had that as a little easter egg in our drawing one and people really liked it that's pretty cool i'm gonna stop the screen share now so we shared out that app via the qr code but we're also going to send it via email and when you get the app via email any app that anybody creates on code.org you can remix and make your own versions of it which is pretty cool and that's actually one of the challenge things we're going to ask students to make their own version of the image doodler add features to it and then we'll have you present that to next week's special guest who's going to be an extremely special special guest uh i'm not sure i'm allowed to share who it is yet we're going to be announcing that i'm not secret it's secret we're going right even i don't know it's great you don't even know i don't think i know his first name is bill oh that's that's the most i'm gonna be able to say i'm too much that's not too much created a monster all right so let's switch to see if there's questions for that folks have for mike um mike there's a question from actually akira can you come on screen akira has been managing collecting questions in the background akira is basically one of the behind the scenes producers of code break and if we could get her on screen to ask the questions for mike hello everyone yes so mike one of the questions we have from sebastian it was how do you manage your time and what do your days look like now both prepandemic and during pandemic yeah um so i'm working on a new project with my instagram cofounder right now that has to do with covid and we're trying to get some good information out there um so i think one of the things that i've learned is it's easy for me to get very deep in coding and kind of lose track of the rest of the world it's probably happened to some of you as you as you've learned things and it's been a lesson i've learned over time that it's really worth taking some breaks going on a little walk we have a dog so playing with the dog seeing my daughter like whatever those different things are it might feel in the moment like you're like oh but i'm just coding i just can code for another hour but in the long run it's really nice to make sure you've got some ability to get some fresh air trust me i definitely had some instagram days where i would like get up i'm like i haven't showered in three days i've gone up from my chair in 12 hours so learning to have a little bit of uh of a break every now and then is really important thank you so much and our second question is for both mike and hattie the student said i'm interested in pursuing something related to computer science what should i do at home in order to prepare myself and also is there any code or content i should look for so both mike from your experience when you were younger and hottie from the code.org perspective i loved like um basically seeing how things were built so um as you learn to code if there's something that you're really interested like if there's a website that you think is really cool or if there's a project that you see online in a lot of cases the code isn't online if it's on github if it's on if it's linked from code.org so i learned a lot just from seeing how other people did their projects um and i think there's that's one of the things i love about computer science is there's a real culture of sharing like you do something interesting and then you can tell the world how you did it there's tutorials um so i think that's a really good way to continue to learn yeah and and there's so many one of the beauties of computer science is it's perfect for the time we're in right now because computer science is something where part of the learning comes from a teacher in a classroom but a huge part of it just comes from experimentation trying something seeing how it breaks trying it a different way you know most subjects in school are about a right or wrong answer did you get the answer right did you get it wrong when we made our image doodler there's bugs but if you find you always run into bugs and then you fix it and it's the right color red or green or blue you can choose what you want you know you get some expressiveness and creativity and and working with other people's projects is one great way if you visit code.org if you're in in in high school middle school or elementary school there's uh there's courses there for all ages to learn so if you haven't done it at all our express course on code.org is one of the best ways to do it if you're in school and your school offers computer science principles that's the most popular high school course in computer science right now there's over 100 000 students almost 150 000 students all across the united states taking that course with code.org right now so if you're in high school please sign up for computer science principles for next year and if your school doesn't offer it ask the principal to offer it code.org will prepare your existing teachers so that's a wonderful way to do it we're at the top of the hour so i want to tell people we're going to send you email with assignments for this week if you're not on our email list go to code.org break so you can get the assignments for this week and
