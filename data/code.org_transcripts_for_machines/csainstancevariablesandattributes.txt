hi i'm lucy i'm a computer science student at the university of washington and i do research in accessibility and human computer interaction basically i work on making technology more accessible to people with disabilities when we look at an object in the real world how do we describe it to someone else if i place an order for a cake i might describe to the chef that i want a two layer chocolate cake with rainbow sprinkle my friend might order a three layered vanilla cake with strawberries on top both cakes but different these descriptions or characteristics are what we call attributes we represent these attributes as instance variables in java instance variables are variables defined in a class where each variable represents an attribute of an object in this case we create a cake class and declare instance variables to represent a cake's layers flavor and toppings when we create a cake object it will get its own copy of these instance variables so we can assign specific values for the cake for example we could assign the value 2 to layers the value chocolate to flavor and the value sprinkles to topping when we create a class we decide what attributes we want the instance variables to represent for example if we created a student class we might declare instance variables for the student's name age and grade level when we create a student object the object then gets its own copy of the instance variables that are initialized for the values we specify all students but each with their own attributes their own instance variables using instance variables we can store attributes for each object we create
