foreign let's say we're designing a program to keep track of the members of our after school club we can create a class called Club member to represent all club members this class has attributes for their name and grade our club member class also has methods to represent the behaviors that all club members can do each Club has regular members and special members called Club officers Club officers have all the attributes of a club member plus special attributes to represent their unique abilities in this case our club member class is a super class and our club officer is a subclass superclass is a class that can be extended to create subclasses subclass is a class that extends a superclass and inherits its attributes and behaviors inheritance is an objectoriented programming principle where a subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors of a superclass inheritance allows us to create special versions of a class and reuse code now we can use subclasses with their own capabilities that share attributes and behaviors from a superclass foreign
