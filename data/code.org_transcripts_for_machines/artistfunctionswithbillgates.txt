One of the great things in computer programming is once you've taught a computer how to do an action, you can call that function again. You give it a name and then you can call it. That's really like extending the language. In the program we built, we learned how to draw a square by moving and turning four times. We can take that function and give it a name, draw a square, so that any time we want to do that, we simply say draw a square and it will go back and invoke that function, that code. It will get done for us. We've added that concept to our programming language.
