IF Statements People make decisions every day. For example before you go outside you kind of have an IF statement that says, IF it's raining, THEN I need to get my jacket. And, computers are amazing once you decide those kinds of statements, that they can reliably execute those things at unbelievable speed. And so, a computer program really is a little bit of math and some IF statements, where the decision gets made. IF/ELSE STATEMENTS An IFELSE statement is a decision between two things. So say for example, if it's a weekday, it's time to go to school, otherwise you can stay home and have fun.
