hi if you're here joining us for our CS fundamentals workshop we're going started one minute and we're going to learn about what's going on with cs fundamentals this year so stay tuned and if you want to join the conversation you can tweet us at teach code throughout the conversation we're going to be monitoring that and we'll be answering any questions you have if you tweet them at each code and hi I'm just going to keep repeating myself because I don't know who's joining us so if you're joining us we're going to start in them about 30 seconds welcome and again we're using Twitter for the conversation so you can tweet us at teach code throughout the conversation and we're going to answer your questions okay it looks like it's four o'clock we're going to get started and I think oh yeah he's hot he's going to join us so we've got we've got hottie he's our founder and CEO and um hi everybody I'm Alice I am our chief product officer and this is ryan i I'm Ryan on a project manager for our elementary school programs great and so during this webinar um what we're going to be doing is uh just give me a little update on CS fundamentals and what's happened we're going to demo the new features that we've built over the summer so you can see what everything that you've got for backtoschool you didn't have last year and we're also going to show you some of the stuff that's upcoming and again if you just joined us if you have any questions during the conversation you can tweet them at teach code and we're going to be answering your questions live as you guys sweet about us so how do you gonna kick things off sure uh kinda awkward talking to the side we're talking to Eddie show they could talk back to us or just via Twitter anybody's there please tweet of teachers ever though there is more than one of it there's already TV leaders hey um well first I just want to thank all the teachers who've participated with you know bringing computer science to classrooms in the last few years it's just been incredible to see that the growth of demand and interest excitement computer sciences in the three years at code.org had first launched our code studio platform we're not the point where 380,000 teachers have created a counselor code studio and 12 million students are have coded at our platform that's you know obviously the hour of code has been a huge driver of interest in computer science at that the code studios growth has just been incredible to watch at this point at least fifteen percent of all students in America and have accounts on our system and are pretty hefty of roughly ten percent of all teachers in America have accounts in our system that's just incredible to think about for something that's only three years old and really that's thanks partly the great work that our team does but in large part of the word amount of teachers telling each other about the importance of computer science and so I just wanted to thank all the teachers who've embraced computer science in the last few years for your work you know the teacher led movements to bring computer science students has yes it's a worldwide movement but in this country it is completely changing our education system in it at a pace that nobody's ever seen before at and it's not because you know famous people are saying that you should learn to CS and topic as important politicians are saying it's because teachers have decided that this is important and so many teachers are doing it the famous people and politicians are are coming around to it as well as I'm sure you've seen this year President Obama basically decided that computer science is something that he wants to take up as one of the sort of his legacy goals for his for his last year visit administration announcing a plan or at least the designer for every schools teach computer science so it's exciting to see the work that we've done and really the work that teachers worldwide have embraced reach such a critical level of sort of I guess critical mass to get to that level of sort of endorsement anyway we've spent our summer making a whole lot of improvements to our courses and core platform so you know the main point of this webinar is to welcome teachers to the new year and to to get a chance to look at some of the new things that the team is built so I think Alice will kick it off yeah so I'm going to show you some of the new things that are already live that you can see now and then after I do that Ryan is going to show some of the stuff that's upcoming that is reka try now but isn't isn't slide on the site yet um so there is my screen hopefully you can also send me these past questions okay so you can all play I'll see my screen um if you want to it might not be the default cuz my sound saw on yeah can you okay hold on i'm gonna make my how do i intrude oh you did it sound now presenting everyone okay well it's not just on our screen except for everybody and its ears simply okay okay so hopefully you're seeing this computer science fundamentals backtoschool webinar um again you can tweet it at teach code if you want to reach us so we just had our update next thing we talked about new features that we added for the 20162017 so this is the features imma give you a quick demo of each of these the first thing this happened late at the end of last year but course for is now complete so last year we're working on it it was in beta the whole year and so there were some changes being made we've taken a ton of feedback based on your feedback during the beta phase and if you look at course for now you'll see that it's got all those improvements we've added hints we've added more challenging puzzles because many of you told us in our survey our annual survey that you really wanted more challenges for some of the students in your class you'll see that this course has those challenges just for super hard it's hard but you know you've been asking us to make it hard it's hard so if you have kids who are getting bored send them on to course part at the end of it we've also added this special section we got super challenges on variables super challenges on for loops super challenge and then extreme challenge so you know more and more and more challenges you'll also see if you go to the course and this will be true of all of our course pages we've updated so you've got these nice view lesson plan lakes over to the right for each of the courses and they were visible before but a lot of people were missing that's is this tiny little itty bitty lakes and I've got this big links to the lesson plan and we've also made it easier for you to switch with this teacher panel of between a student view and a teacher view so when you look at it you're seeing it as a teacher so you see the lesson plans but when you have your screen up in front of the classroom oftentimes you want to show the students where to click you don't want you want your screen to look just like their screen so if I go to student view here all of the special links for teacher panels and other things for teachers will disappear and my screen will look just like the students scream and I can go back to teacher review here and I'm all of my lesson plans so check out course for it's designed for students who have finished course 3 it's not supposed to be the starting point so if your students are you just getting started start with course too if your students can read start with course one of your students can't read and when i finish course three course for is now available next thing on the list is we've improved a bunch of teacher support oh I already shared the first one which is the lesson plan links another thing we've done is add support for pair programming um and this is you know we have some videos and resources available online that I we can send I think they're the link we sent you about the school but one of the things that we found is that and not just as other people have said when students work together they learn in a different way than when they just work by themselves and so something that you might want to try in your classroom is to you know me and Ryan are here that we can just you know hair together on the same computer one of us is the driver one of us is helping out and navigating and then we'll switch and you can be the driver and I can help navigate and that you know increases collaboration it allows students to learn from each other try to explain something to another student you learn in different ways and you do when you just try to solve the puzzles by yourself it's also great in schools where you might not have onetoone computers with student ratios the problem that we had was that when we did that we would even log into my account are we were logged into Ryan's account and so when the teachers were looking at the student progress and here I've got the teacher dashboard up they only saw the progress from the student who was logged in it was hard to keep track of the fact that lion had also done these puzzles because he was sitting at the computer with me so now we've added the ability for students to choose who they paired who they're paragraphing with and mark down for the teacher and for the student that they both completed that puzzle so what I've got here I'm gonna switch windows here switch again okay so I Lucas I am logging in i'm using my picture password and this is our normal login screen if i'm using a picture password for those of you don't recognize that some kids will log in with email or word pass for this works no matter how you log in but here's picture password I'm going to pick my a password which is the pirate there's a neat checkbox here where I can say I have a partner of my computer so that's music that's the new thing is the partner at my computer so I'm going to go ahead and sign in with my partner and when I do that it'll let me pick who I'm partnering with and in most cases it's one other person but sometimes look you know three kids at a computer so we let you pick three or two in this case I'm going to work with Ryan because sitting next to me actually let me work with Mattie and Ryan oh just Maddie I'm going to add my partner and let's go ahead and do this first puzzle here and I am going to try to get to that sunflower and you'll notice that when i'm logged in with my team at the top right here instead of just saying hi Lucas it says hi team and any point I can come here and see who's logged in I'm logged in with Lucas and maddy and i could click that again to log one of us out but let's solve this puzzle forward move forward move forward and run totally did it I ate that sunflower done okay now what you see here is that I've got my green dot showing that I finished that level but when I go back to the teacher view future view so that was staged to maize and I was Lucas and Maddie this was before they did it i'm going to refresh and see what's happened now and let's go back into stage two to look at the progress on stage two and here you can see that as a teacher I can see that both Lucas and Maddie completed this puzzle and I can zoom in on it by clicking on it to see one of their answers and when I do that I can see that i'm looking at Lucas's answer but that he has this little pair programming I icon and he worked with Maddie who is the navigator this instance they also both get little pair programming icons next to their names over here and maddie is grayed out because I can tell that they were logged in as lucas and maddie was was the one pair programming with their gear so their answer is going to be under Lucas's account not Mattie's account so we have that if you have a question from teach code can the teacher assigned burners the collaborative work between students so the question is whether the teacher can assign partners and actually yes we totally expect you guys to be doing assignments we don't rather than try to do that all in the tool ahead of time we heard from teachers is it something they like to do in the classroom so they'll just in the classroom say you know pair up with your elbow buddy or they'll move the students to the right place and then the students are sitting in the right place the students are going to login with the partners and one of the important things that we heard is that we need the flexibility to change whose students are partnering with day after day so just because I work with hottie today doesn't mean I want to work with hottie tomorrow howdy might be haughty might be sick tomorrow or you know I just want to switch up his working with who's so there's nothing locked in I can work with different students every single day and the students will continue whatever puzzles you want them to do whoever is the driver um their accounts the person who logs in on their account that's the one where that's where the students will start we'll start with whoever that student left off but if you want the students to redo puzzles they did the day before Valentin with a partner that's fine too that's up to you and so we just really wanted to give you guys the control to manage your classroom and this is about you guys being able to to pick how you want your students to work together and again if your questions you can email like teach code like somebody just did a next you ms learning I'm sorry tweet tweet thank you how to treat that's why I need my navigator here to help me up a stage extras so another thing that we've heard from you guys about how the classroom is running is that you often have students who just zoom ahead um and they finish the end of the stage and they just zip right on to the next stage and you would rather when they finish the stage you know do something else that day and sometimes it's something else on the computer and sometimes it is something not on the computer at all like when they finish stage 2 they're supposed to go journal this was me brightest we practicing their handwriting of adaptoid on to stage 3 and so we wanted to give you guys the ability to have a little bit more control over what's going on in your classroom so I think people also specifically asked for letting us lockdown stages searches can't go ahead this is right that's good guest uh that would we don't have that yet but we do have the piece of just a little bit more like another sort of a little bit more control over the flow it's not complete control but it is a little bit more control so when you set up your classes you'll now see there's this new section called stage extras and you can also change it for an existing course so I can go into one of my existing courses if you didn't already check this box and say yes save and now this one as stage extras turned on now what stage extras does what is the default print it's a default to honor it defaults to off right now because it's sort of in beta we're trying it out um but if you don't get a lot of feedback and we're going to continue to improve it I want to let you guys know about it so you can try it out now but if you you know if we find out that a lot of people using it and you wanted to default on we could switch the default on we were thinking it once we added more features and made it more you know added more stuff to it we would probably start defaulting it on right now it's still default on so let's say I'm doing this stage on functions and I get to the last level on the stage I'm just going to skip ahead here um create a function to what it's a turn move forward make three honey in the return the betta words start in turn now that's going to take a little while let's do an easier one I'm gonna go back with okay I need to pick the correct block to draw this image using the given functions okay so I'm gonna pick this one I hit submit and instead of believe me on to the next level when your stage extras turned on it's going to pop up this little extra dialogue that says congratulations you finish the stage and then it's going to say ask your teacher what to do next um so hopefully they ask you uh but if they don't we also you know you can help them say you know go practice your handwriting or you can say to them you know you should try doing a neutron we have a new app or they can open a project they've already worked on and do more with that project and these are basically just exploring spaces where they can just build something that's interesting to them they can the app they can vote a story they can build you know characters moving around a simple little game where things kind of shoot at each other with the drawing they can build a creative drawing whatever they want but these are just sort of play spaces for the students and this is really designed to be used in courses two three and four um where it's not designed yet for the pre readers these are the new drawing new Act tools aren't really at the level of course one so I'd recommend it for courses two three and four now I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the richer controls so those are some of the things we've given you to improve your ability to manage your classroom we're also doing things for students to make you know their experience better two in particular that I wanted to call out one is related to what I just showed you so when the students do choose new app here what they're going to go to is our play lab area and I've got a example little play lab out here that a student could make and we've been doing some things to make this a space more interesting for the students so that they can play more I do more interesting things um in particular we just added an ask block so this lets them make things that are interactive and this could be a choose your own adventure story or it could be using numbers to affect what's happening I wrote this simple little app we've reset and run it for you um I've got my little witch she's gonna come down how high should she fly hottie how high should my witch blood pixels leg also 200 200 pixels high okay let's submit it just gonna go up 200 pixels and say she's flying which is get up exciting but I think the thing is that they can make things that are interactive it makes variables a lot more interesting because when a variable is predefined by the code it's less of a variable and this way it's a better way to teach variables because they can you know take a change which variables should do variables should be variable so that is that's a example of one of the ways we're making this space better continuing to do other things here but I thought that one was worth calling i don't have puzzles or activities if that push should we use this new block yet but available now but we're going to be adding those yeah we're going to add some puzzles that use it right now it's just available in play lab and we're going to make some puzzles that build it into the into those lines there's lots of fun activities you could do that exactly to make like a mad lib story where you know the little richer character can say say an adjective or say a verb or seeing now and then it can read back a story that combines those things for greater lots of the taper can't do that one yet it can't because the strings because we put the string to like blows what we're adding the street joint block very soon so we will and if you guys have other suggestions feel free to email us like let us know what you think we should be doing or tweet us the next thing we did was we added this unused code block so um one of the things that we saw was a smooth would write a lot of code and then just want to test it with part of the code or they're moving echoed around I don't want to throw it away cuz I spent a lot of time on this um so you know I kind of want to drag it off um what I want to keep it here and we wanted to make it really clear which code was running and which code wasn't running it can be really confusing we also see scenarios where if the code is an attached the student has no idea why their code isn't working so for example let's say I took my whole area and I just put it here it's not attached to the one run block nothing's going to happen when this code runs but it's not necessarily obvious especially to a beginning student that nothing's gonna happen when I get run so what we did was we added this nice easy to also give you an error when you have an attached go to go to say if it's a yourself attention a lot oh just which wasn't great so now what we do is instead of giving you an error we grade out a little bit we do a little bit of a sort of alpha on it so you can it looks less like it's good around and then when i get run so let me take some of this off of here so it's a little bit great out while i'm working and then when i hit run um the unused code gets highlighted the little box that shows that it's unused code so now I know that this code is sitting here on use but it also means that I can keep it around um so if I do want to use it later or just hold on to it it makes it easier for students to sort of play around as they're working and try out different things okay so that was a little bit about what we're doing for students we've also been improving our puzzles and you know there was a ton of work that went into course for improving hints improving a whole bunch of different things but I wanted to show you a couple of the new of the ways in which our puzzles are improved and this is across the board you know not just in course for so the first thing we've done is we've added a lot of hints we've also added a new UI for hands and this came in late last year to some of you may have already seen this but those of you who haven't noticed it i wanted to point it out we wanted to again some of you said you wanted more challenging puzzles for your students but the same time we want to support students who maybe aren't ready for those more challenging puzzles so being able to differentiate more and offer puzzles that were harder to begin with but then enough hints that all the students could eventually get there so theres a new pic you I over here you can see it on some levels you get a little light bulb next to your guy so this little artist guy has a light bulb next one with six that means there's six hints on this level so I picked it with a lot of hands it's very hard um but I can click that I'll see all the instructions again and I can choose to get a new hint um and it's telling me a little bit this is a visual hit this one's a graphical one and it's giving you a sense of if I wanted to make this how would it look like wallets getting made and that definitely helps but maybe that's not enough for me and I want more so I can click again um and I can review all of my existing hints and another hint in this case this is a series of Octagon to the sides that are counter pixels long so I can get more and more hints and go through it I wanted to point these out just so you know they're available and if your students are having trouble one of the things you can encourage them to do is if there is a little light bulb on that level click on the light bulb to get the hint for that level another thing we've done um to make the puzzles more interesting is we now have some puzzles that will have limited number of blocks and those cities in a few places um one of the places you'll see it is in course to when we're teaching the maze what we want to do is get the student to try to learn how to use a repeat block and we used to do this by saying they had to use the repeat block but that was too specific it's like hey you didn't use their people I was annoying you got ya okay and I glad you got it we don't use the repeat block right yeah you put five move forwards and you feel like you solved it but it wasn't solved the right way and that's that's not the given one business to have so well the worst part is they're pig would complain and you know basically it looks like you got it right except we just penalizing and saying it wasn't good enough but my bird totally got that thing so I should totally get credit for passing it so now there is no way to pass this level without using the repeat block I've got an infinite number of turn left blocks I could turn left all day round and just turn the circles but what you see here is a little one next to move forward that means i only get one move forward bloc and when i use it i now have zero move forward slash guns a little bit greyed out and so while I in turn right and turn left as much as I want with only one move forward bloc the only way I'm ever going to solve this puzzle is by figuring out to use the repeat block with my before word block and now well now i'm gonna turn about a hit a moral so that's not gonna help it all either i really i could turn left one more time and that would be brilliant but uh oh and my favorite bird thinks i need to keep coding so yes I do I didn't evilly but yeah I wanted to show you the new limited number of blocks and that you'll see how that on various levels especially when we're trying to teach something like loops where we're trying to show you how you can do it with your blocks ah the next thing oh do you we did we shall visit keep track of how many hits they need how many hits they used or how many hits a high dose and beverages yeah so we are collecting busy every time you click to get hint we count how many times a student uses a hint we don't have any user interface yet to show that AXA so as a teacher you can't see that oh you know Sally used seven pins if Mary used only three hints or so on but we're collecting that data and will be will we're planning and basically finding ways to do intelligent in space that um so that make sense so we understand and we at least keep track of how many spin set a student needed to use before they at the solution um we're working on what's the best area basically featuring that back in terms of the dashboard just because we don't want to make a dashboard at too confusing so I think we can go into a little bit more detail but how are climbing using it but but still sort of a work in progress for us or good yeah we gonna could say that there's kind of that you talk more about that one so the last one of these is not part of cs fundamentals but again some of you have told us that your strings are ready for something more i'm particularly talking to you know fifth grade sixth grade teachers people using the accelerated course for CS fundamentals right now maybe in middle school if you and your students are ready to go further we just made a change to our privacy policy such that a ploughed is now available to middle school classrooms what i mean by that is anybody under age 13 so if you have a nineyearold who's ready to go for this why all things go for it total electrical fun it's available for elementary it's available for everyone it's probably i'll show you it is it is a tool or we you know we think a middle school classroom is probably the right age but you know you've advanced if fourth graders um you can go ahead and check it out so this is our new tool we've been using it in our high school class CS principles if you go to a ploughed you can see it and on this page we've got a bunch of tools to help you get started um if you're just trying to figure out what it's all about you can watch our little video here we have a course for high school students to introduce it and there's also a bunch of short demo videos it'll show you how to make an app using it and then there's some sample apps you can use to get started now this is a tool it's a real programming tools students can make web apps and these can get quite complicated they can use database they can use servers they can they can do really interesting things but it's also very easy to get started and for students who want to you know more more comfortable with blocks or maybe they're not typing as quickly it allows you to use type blocks but it is sort of more real code in that it's using real JavaScript and the code inside the blocks here is actually JavaScript and they can switch back and forth between a text mode where they're typing the code and a block mode where they're dragging and dropping blocks if any of you did the Star Wars tutorial we have for our code last year with JavaScript a use the same technology to switch back and forth between blocks and text it also makes it easy to get started creating your own apps because we have a design mode where the students can drag and drop buttons and images and other items right onto the screen and then cut those up I'm not going to go into detail on this because this is Miss fundamentals let me make a new app may apps so quickly and so easily that it's worth charlie okay so I just click create new to make a new app and I'm gonna go into design mode and I'm going to drag a text box here it's going to say enter a number I'm going to button here that says draw this will be extremely simple as a nap and then I'm going to change the screen background to be some fun color we're pleased bennek another and then some questions what is this code they're going to do so when we go into code mode we can decide what happens when the draw button gets clicked so first thing to say on event so when this button gets clicked what should we do but we need to know what number you typed in here and so to do that at its create a valuable let's call it X and X is going to get the value that is in that control so we need to get get the text you're going to say x is the get texts from the text input so when this event gets click the Bible X will get the number that's over in there and then I'm just going to move forward that many steps and I say move forward however many pixels I want four instead of 25 pixels I'll move forward x pixels action or we can just say after that we can turn right and I'll turn right 90 degrees every time so that's the that's the app and you can run it and so i'm going to enter the number five and we're going to move forward five pixels and turn right never enter the number 20 only for 20 pixels and move forward a hundred remove 100 pixels and I move forward 30 30 pixels and for 200 299 right not a very complicated app but what's cool about this is now you can share this and use this on your phone and you can also switch this these blocks into text mode and this is basically the JavaScript code for that app you can type in JavaScript and switch it back two blocks there's a lot lot more you can do but has extremely simple app that I felt in two minutes that's what's cool about that loud cool um so yeah and now that's all stuff that's available you use it right now it's ready for back to school and we're going to show you now some of the things that are coming up so Ryan can you want to share your screen yes so Ryan's i'm gonna show stuff that's not available yet but you can turn it on with your phone experiments yes so um we have a couple of new features that you can actually try your cell I'm sorry I mess it try it yourself or with your students but they're not quite totally done yet so we're going to give you sort of a sneak peek of them and these are a response to some of the feedback that we've heard about how students use code studio and some of the things that could help them solve puzzle a little bit better so this screen that you see is probably pretty familiar to you if you use codes view in your class before this is a puzzle from course one with some instructions for the beat so we always start with this pop up that has some instructions inside and once I click OK my instructions get very small down here if I happen to realize that they're there and I can get them back in this dialog if I want to by clicking on it but it can be kind of hard to see my instructions in my at the same time along with that if I am sort of working toward a solution but it's going to take me a little while to get there because I want to write a little bit of code test it right a little bit more code test that um every time I get run I get this sad face pop up that blocks my code and tells me that I didn't get it quite right and maybe I knew that and I was just trying to iterate to a solution which is actually a good thing and that's something that we want kids to try to do is to build their solutions progressively an experiment with their code and then I can't see that feedback alongside the code that I wrote so I wonder oh wait what what was the be telling me what did I have to do so we tried to address them on this feedback by other what ends up happening is kids just get learn they just learn every time the popup constitutes could be asked to get rid of it whether it's the instructions what's the presence of feedback as it gets them away from the coating I wasn't they raised their hand mr. Sloane what else is it do on this level because they forgot yes so what we did is we designed a new instruction panel that appears up here above my code and it is also going to update while I run my code so before when I would hit run and I didn't get it quite right I would get that big pop up um now I get some feedback and help that pops up in this panel up here so it's telling me I should try a different block I will write some more code and as I try different solutions and work toward the right answer I'll get different kinds of feedback that pop up here next to me as the beat and I actually can also get things like my hints up here so earlier Allison showing you that we now have this hint light bulb that appears next to the character sometimes down by the instructions we've integrated this hint experience with this top area as well so now I can see my hints and review I nince while I work on my coat so if i click on my hips and say I want a new one I can now be my hands and my instructions and all of that up here at the top all together and so what this does is it makes it a little easier for me to review all the information that I have and my code at the same time and maybe write code little by little without getting a big sad popup I'm so I'll scroll graph is there any way to look at all of it um yes so you can either you can scroll with your scroll bar or the buttons or if you want to you can see that there's these little dots here and you get the arrow when you hover over it you can actually resize it to make it as big as you want so if you have a large hint in there maybe there's a picture in like I'll show that earlier puzzle you can resize it to make it as big or as small as you want if you just want to kind of minimize it and get rid of most of the information and only see the basics you can hit this little less button and that will shrink it down to as small as it could be so this is actually out there and you can try it in your classes or on your own if you'd like to um we can tweet the experiment address yeah we'll tweet out some instructions for how you can try it on your own if you want to switch growth yeah teach teach each other um and then i'm going to show you one other reason we haven't rolled this out yet by the way is because we know the kids in general ignore the instructions and these instructions up at the top unless kids know that that's where they're happening there I doesn't notice it as well so we're looking at visit doing something in the interface to sort of the very very first time draw your attention that the be up there is telling you stuff because if you don't even know it's there you just completely ignored so you know the popups or two in your face this is now a little bit too unnoticeable or it's on the right balance of the train find somewhere in the middle so the other feature that i'm going to show you is currently only available in course one but it's designed for some of our pre reader students so some of the feedback that we got is in course one we say that it's designed for early readers and for pre readers but sometimes you still have to read the instructions to solve the puzzle and that can be an unnecessary stumbling block for students who are still learning to read or student for whom English is a second language or all kinds of things like that and so we're exploring adding some new tools to course one that will allow students to play out instructions in text to speech so right now we have this orange button that you can turn on with a special flag that we can also share after the webinar we're going to change the way that this is designed to look a little different but you'll get sort of the early preview of what it looks like why do I need to click to listen to the instructions it's got some be automatic or just reads up the instructions if you choose to make it that way yeah if you turn it on it will just automatically read instructions that you go to each level um and what I get right now is this play button which I'm realizing no one will be able to hear you turn off your phone i canít a little via get to Decter and then make two honey maybe that's what it will do yeah oh well then it will play my voice from that oh that's okay anything so yeah uh well sweet eels turn it out so you can try it yourself I don't want to get feedback on the call so I'm not going to try it here but just take my word for it when I say that if I press play you will carry the computer read the instructions out but you'll be able to try it yourself this is available in all the puzzles in course one this is also hidden behind a new feature flag but will tell you how to turn it on and turn it off if you'd like to use it with your class when we do turn it on for real it will be a little bit more little kid friendly like right now there are five buttons on the screen um we will not have five bucks on the screen there will be one big button with a microphone and you'll hit it and it will play so the kids will be able to like adjust and we're wide and fast forward that's why it's behind the flag right now it's just we wanted to give you early insights what we're developing right also we want to go to the point worried either you always want your instructions read out loud or you never do and if you always want the read out loud you just need to click anything it just reads them yeah exactly also we keep saying teach code but if you follow at each code other features that we're developing we put them behind these flags and we share them on our blog and edit each code with teachers who want to see what working on and if you want to try anything before we ship it that's the way to follow us along and try it and we'd love to get feedback from early early users if you wanna try something early and tell us what's working and what's not you can help us make it work better for your classroom so really appreciate all the feedback we get on those features so we got some questions it looks like um so here oh look at this Jenny with the dance for us okay so I got I got a series of questions that I'm going to read from you guys a question one um how do I get my school to buy into CS yeah I guess I'll take that question um there's a lot of different ways but we've one thing we've done to make this as easy as possible as we've made of default powerpoints that people can use can you screen share for your computer so I can show or copy and find us let me keep that yeah sure you don't do so you know increasingly more and more educators realize screen share email already yes so if you go to code org the page that has stats has a whole bunch of other valuable stuff up and this is the pager basic promoting computer science one thing it has is down here tools to help you advocate locally and this power point here which is about why computer science in k12 is incredibly valuable resource that basically talks about how not only those jobs in computer science that it's foundational and it teaches critical thinking and more parents wanted and the president says everybody should study it and those types of things all the best sort of selling points of why teaching computer science are over here and Maddie if you could actually just find the link to the sea tweeted out of being at helpful safaris listing in terms of helping come into school to embrace computer science this also here is a letter that a teacher consent to their principal you know it just has the text that that we use to recommend and this tablet is really really compelling and most the material in the PowerPoint is basically the powerpoint version of these slides that you see right above here that are in the sort of web page but it has some sort of nicely laid out in a PowerPoint with a bunch of narrative around it another thing is that if you know teachers were interested we have professional development workshops around the country they're free the one day long to get started I know some of you have looked for them before not someone in your area we have added another thirty percent more facilitators this summer so we now have over 200 facilitators around the country who are offering these in a lot of new regions so if you've looked before there's nothing in your region try again because we've got a bunch more teachers offering these actually while we're here let me show how you find those also any of you RCS fundamentals teacher at an elementary school and having gone through our professional development workshops if you click the teach page on co.org and choose elementary school this gives you overall description of our helmet through school program but then this here button that says learn more and find a workshop at there's way more locations and have workshops available nationwide especially right now so if you look at the whole map the country there's workshops almost every States and certainly in every major city so if you haven't gone to one of our element whose for workshops please please check them out and the other thing you can do is organize an hour of code with your school is a great way to get people excited so our of cups coming up you can sign up now at hour of code calm and organize it for your whole school get people who haven't tried it before to get you know it's a great way to people try one hour and then sometimes family anymore after they try an hour so if you register early right now you can get a packet with posters of students to put up on your classroom so sign up if you sign up now it's a good time to sign up where do you start up our code calm I okay question 2 I push for keeping your science at my second grade but it's not in first grade what course could I begin with that's the Margaret um so Margot if you're starting with 2nd grade years I would recommend starting with course to of course one ism is really designed for free readers but by second grade your students would probably be well enough to do quest to and course to is an entry point for students it's a great entry point for students who can't read so start with course to question three super teddy bear um so which framework and language did you use to make coats to do freshman early it gets it yeah well this is technical questions I think it's persons asking under the hood what did we use to make coats to do em so the underlying framework and language we use is something called but the language is Ruby and it's built up a framework Ruby on Rails and this is there's many different languages you can use to build interactive websites have like Java Python but Ruby on Rails is certainly one of the most popular ones mess so when we've used then there's also the interactivity that's happening inside the page for dragging and dropping and so on and that we basically started off with a open source component but Google builds in a language called blockley which is designed to you know mimic you know tools like scratch and the block the open source thing we've expanded on it quite a bit but you know Ruby on Rails on our back end and blockley on the front end is the short answer to how we thought Scott studio yeah so the next question which rhymes okay skip it that will coming back because we're getting a devil study question 5 can students with some coding experience he's at lab if they haven't done any of your courses oh and you know every student is different I would say absolutely your students are already Cody um for example let's say you've got a couple of things you're going to want you're going to want them to be able to type because it's you know typing things so if they're not comfortable typing they can use the blocks but you know most the students will do it it does require computer you can't do it on an iPad and does require some coding experience we have places to get started when it also depends on the students age and how sophisticated they are what we teach a flap and high schools we start there we start there were students who have absolutely no experience with any programming and they start with that left so probably what's most important if we didn't show this but if you go to the app flat page yeah there's an actual tutorial that you can go through that has stages and puzzles just like CS fundamentals but instead of getting the B to get to the honey you're getting the curt to get to the pig it involves you know little bits and pieces of a plot to gradually teach you how to use a plaid yeah that's different because unlike CS fundamentals it doesn't grade you when you get it right or wrong it's designed for a slightly more mature student that then themselves can decide whether they got it right or wrong but still it's a stepbystep learning how to use Apple app so as soon you knows a little bit of coding has done a little bit of cs fundamentals but wants to jump straight into apple app i would recommend they go into those courses first i'd rather than going to the whole tool and trying to sort out what's what yeah absolutely but it is a it is a luxury tool so if you want to try it and your students who are ready for it it doesn't you know I think it's more about the sophistication age the student when they're willing to to work with it's a morgue it's much more powerful tool than something like play lab and like gate by portage you can build things that are much more sophisticated and if your students who want to try that and have the you know sort of reading level and maturity to go for it I would say try it see if it you know see if it works for your students so the next question is question for how can teachers organize their student accounts sections to get ready for a new year on code studio without making new accounts especially when getting ready for a new year on code studio before you asked it at Ryan for anybody coming in late if you want to ask a question we are looking at it just tweet them to n teach code that's what we're looking for questions so you can add to the questions but yeah how could you could organize their students interceptions for the school year that's good question so we recently built a new feature with the help of a volunteer contributor actually to help teachers solve this problem so I have a twenty problem as you have students from last year and you want to organize them for next year yeah so I have my newport news from last school year which are mostly fictional characters but if it's now the new school year and I want to move them to a different section we now have this move students button that I can see from inside my manage students tab so if i click on move students i will see a list of my students let's move Jane and Yoda and I can choose to move them to one of my other sections so all of these are sections that I've already created so if you're going to be working with the same students from last year but maybe they're in different classes or different class times or you want to reorganize them into new sections you can use this to move them into a different section but maybe Jane and Yoda are actually going to a new class next year and they're going to be working with a new teacher so this other browser is my other account and I created this new section that I'm going to use for my students but I need this means you're walking miles of country chillin glamp I'm Jenna ghost yes so I am I am their teacher from next year um and so if I look I'll see there are no students in here um but my section has this code here it's six characters and what i can do is i can send this to their teacher from last year and say my section code for Jane and Yoda is c dy bjc and i can actually now move them into that section so even though that section belongs to a different teacher as long as I know what the section code is I can move them over there I can move them or i can copy them let's say I want to move them to be only in the new one and then I click move students so they're no longer visible here in my section but if I go and put on my other teacher hat and refresh you'll see I have two students here now and if I click on manage students I have Jane Doe and Yoda so this will hopefully help you as you're students may be a jump into a new grade you can transfer their accounts to their new teacher and you can also have their teachers from prior years transfer them to you or you can just move them within sections on your own account if you're teaching the same as last year can the teacher can the new teacher that the students all have accounts from last year from a new teacher to say go to the section code URL and have them doing that section if the students log in with an email address they can do that so if your students log in with an email address you can send a time this one because it's not email but you'll have a joint link which I can find that scroll well you can spread below right below if i could scroll i could show you there we go um I'm just joined link so if my account is set up so that students log in with their email address um I can give all my students this address and if they go there they'll join my section automatically Matty are there any new questions if you delete student accounts does it delete their progress so if students log in with an email address even if they are removed from your section they can still log in so they will still be able to log in and get their progress if students log in with a picture password or a secret word they're only able to log in as long as they're in your section but you can actually have students change there you can have them change their account type at the end of the year to an email address so that they can take their progress with them in the volunteer you want to show how to do that ah yeah show that so in other words if they log in with a picture password and you remove them from your section their progress is gone they can't see anymore right so if they want to keep their progress they need to switch to an email address login so they can login even when they're not on your section right so i can show you i will log in as on solo ghost so you're going to sign out an amana as the students yes so I'm gonna log in as Han Solo and he logs into the picture password of a ghost so right now because I log in with a picture password the only way that I can get to my account is through that special section address that is associated with my teacher but if I go faster go with Richard you still so this is a good example of you guys giving us feedback or just talking about was we used to let anybody put an email address on account we don't do it anymore the picture passwords they can't directly put their email address into the account because we had students because the picture passwords easy to guess logging is each other in us you know section and a mischievous student going in and say i'm ryan from luke and i'm just going to try all of it and figure out some way to log in and then putting my email address and stealing your account and so because that happened we turned that off which is why i was trying to do but it doesn't work anymore so now you as a teacher and need to move everything over to be on the whole so to go to the go to the whole section and edit the section to no longer be fix your passwords you can switch it to email passports you can switch it to work passwords either one will let the student now add some switches the word passwords or email passwords at the end of the year and then let the student put an email address in so now now that he's using word passwords there's a new dropdown for my account and when he goes into his account he can put in you know a password at the end of the year that he needs to take it with them if you go to make your students he's got an email and password so that he can so even if you remove him from this section he can keep using his account going forward by using that email login um you know next year the year after at any point I know there are some teachers who the email is too hard for the students so they've just left sections open from last year but you could like rename that to last year sections needs to keep it out of your way so your students can still get in and is their whole log in to get it to their accounts but but yeah this is how the student is supposed to take their cup with them we add your class any other questions that we got mad anymore Darren's asking how many days and lessons are there in courses screen for sport I teach one hour a week each of the courses one two three and four has roughly 20 lessons so it's for 20 days which can be spread out you know that could be done if you do them one hour a day would be four weeks worth or it gets do it one day a week there we go for a little bit more than half the year that includes the unplugged lessons and you know a lot of teachers we know skip the unplug lessons and they only do the puzzles and the puzzles each of the courses has about 10 hours worth of ten lessons worth of puzzles but we really encourage teachers to try the unplugged ones as well that requires a little bit more prep but they really are great for both engaging the kids without screen time and also helping transfer the learning from the computer to the to their classroom it back and those the teachers do do similar I cover boy who the shooters name you said that was but most teachers who do it about once a week or you know during a set time its most you just don't do this all at once back to back so that's typical zits what once a week or something they go teach it right five minutes out of they give any more questions um so and we can end thank you all for joining us it was great to have you and thank you for teaching this if you ever want to reach us we're at teach code and you can always reach out to us there and you can also reach us by emailing support at code.org if you have any questions concerns bugs anything we can help you work through please continue spreading the word about computer science whether it's via code.org horses or any other tools that you find that you like you know the way the computer science movement is spreading and growing in schools is because teachers telling other teachers about the importance of teaching us so if you meet teachers and other schools or of teachers in your school in other classes at please encourage them to get involved in computer science to check out co.org and to attend our workshops for elementary school thank you so much thanks
