[Ryan Seacrest, TV and Radio Personality] Creativity is using your imagination to approach something entirely different, from a totally different perspective, and then bringing that to life. [Limor Fried, Created Adafruit] Creativity is about making something out of nothing. [Tom Colicchio, Celebrity Chef] So to me creativity is really just taking everything that you've learned, and then completely sort of thinking without norms, without constraints, and just doing something that is completely unique and yours and different. [Nathan Blecharczyk, Created Airbnb] Creativity is thinking differently about your creation. [Raquel, Teacher from Chile] Creativity is an adventure that we know where we start but not where we end. [Anne Marie, Student from Romania] Creativity means doing something unexpected, playing. [Ciara, Singer/Songwriter/Dancer] Creativity is liberating. [Ryan Seacrest, TV and Radio Personality] What will you create? Subtitles by the Amara.org community
