once we have created our scanner object we are ready to use the methods in the scanner class these are the methods that will wait for a user to enter information while the code is running there are many methods in the scanner class but we will focus mainly on the following three next int next double and next line these methods allow a user to enter an int double or string into the console then the computer can store this input in a variable and use the information later let's say we have already declared and initialized our scanner variable and named it input now we want to know what the user's favorite color is first we print the console message what is your favorite color next we create a variable to store the information that the user enters and tell the computer to collect this information since a color name is a string we use the method input dot next line after the user has entered this information we can use that information later in our code they will see a prompt in the console the computer will wait for an answer the user can enter a string and then in the console the user will see a message using that information they just entered in the same way we could get an integer or a double from the user by using next int or next double you don't need to create a new scanner object every time you collect input from the user you can continue to use the same object however when you are done collecting input it's important to close the scanner because scanner uses computer resources all we have to do is type the name of the scanner followed by dot close think of this like hanging up your phone if you kept the phone connected you'd use up all your battery we can collect all kinds of user input information by using the scanner class you
