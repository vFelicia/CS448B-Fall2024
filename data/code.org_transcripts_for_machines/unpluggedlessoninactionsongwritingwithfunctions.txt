the songwriting lesson and the songwriting with parameters lesson are very closely tied together if you're teaching songwriting with parameters you can teach songwriting first to refresh everybody's memory and then it should all flow the way you're about to see in the video if you're only teaching songwriting go ahead and skip the second part but it's very possible that someone will ask about differences and choruses and then you can go ahead and teach them the parameters part as well okay so how many of you have ever looked up lyrics to any song alright so you're probably used to having them written down something like this so has anybody ever heard this song before ideally this would be a song that you guys kind of know but it sounds like the majority of you guys don't know this song so I'm gonna teach you the chorus okay so the chorus have have any of you heard of the chorus of a song when you're looking up lyrics you have the chorus of a song right so the chorus goes I'm Annette I'm Anna I'm Anna I'm Anna I'm a nut can you guys do that with me okay that was very good so now we're gonna take it from here here we go okay very good all right so we went through the lyrics why when it said chorus here why didn't you sing that is why I'm cracked you see chorus okay so what you're saying is that we are singing all this because it's written down but when we say chorus we're really referring back to the thing we already defined earlier right we gave this thing a name and that name was and so now anytime we wanted to use this chunk instead of writing it all over and over and over again all we had to do is put the word very good so you could take verse one and define it over here take verse two and define it over here and verse three over here and then you'd write your program by saying verse one chorus verse two chorus verse three chorus very good alright does everybody get how you define a course and use it later okay so now you guys are saying well what if something's kind of different right what if something a little different in the chorus and we want to call with one thing and then with another thing we could just make two different courses all there really is in Old MacDonald is choruses you just sing the same course over and over but you have to change the words so if you were gonna sing all MacDonald's with all your favorite animals you'd have to have 12 different courses right that wouldn't save you any writing in fact it might be more writing than you need so what we're doing is we're we're introducing something called a parameter can us a parameter parameter so you probably have noticed the word parameter on our word wall but this is what it actually means it's an extra little bit of information that you want to pass through so that you know what to sing in the chorus because it can change in the chorus so here we're gonna have animal so on his farm he had an animal but are we actually gonna sing animal we need to know which animal we're gonna substitute for the word animal and then whatever's first because animal is first whatever's first is going to become animal and whatever second is gonna become sound very good so let's try this let's try singing the song exactly the way it's written chorus pig oink chorus cow mooo chorus chicken Bock is that is that really what they meant for me to say no so what I want you to do now that you understand the definition when it's called with its parameters I want you to see if your brain automatically knows what you're actually supposed to sing okay here's your test are you ready Old MacDonald job guys so what were some things you notice after you were done going all the way through it called chorus so you went all the way through chorus and then what did you do you went to the next line down in the program right and then you did it again and then you went to the next line down in the program and you did it again and then you got back and there was nothing left in the program so you stopped so that's exactly what a computer does when you have a function and there's a function that you've defined somewhere else and you said hey whenever I say this word I really want you to go do all this stuff so I'm only going to type this cuz I got better things to do but you are gonna run all of this oh and because it changes a lot I'm just gonna let you know what I want these special words to become so all I have to do is this and you're gonna do all the work for me that's functions with parameters okay but we don't have to because a computer inside just a computer's programming it understands it's already been told that these are the way we tell you things later so we don't have to do that as part of this one program because the master program that makes the computer run at all has already told it that's a really good question Subtitles by the Amara.org community
