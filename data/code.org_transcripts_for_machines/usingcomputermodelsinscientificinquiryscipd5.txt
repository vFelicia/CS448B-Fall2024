hi everyone i'm melody hageman i'm a science and computer science teacher and i've been working with project guts to help students explore using models in scientific inquiry for a number of years in this presentation we're going to explore how to use models and simulations in scientific inquiry the beauty of developing models is that they can be used as virtual test beds in which to perform your experiments and explore the phenomena you are interested in but first what is a model a model is a simplification of what we want to examine when we create a model we ignore some of the details and focus on what is important to us at the time in computer science we call this simplification an abstraction so just like building a model of a solar system using styrofoam balls is a simplification of the real solar system a computer model is a simplification or abstraction of what we're trying to study but unlike the styrofoam ball physical model once we've created a computer model of what we want to study we can use it to study what we're interested in this is because unlike the styrofoam ball model that just looks like the real thing a computer model can be programmed to act like the real thing a computer model can capture the elements and the behaviors of what we want to study once the computer model is created then we get to use it simulation is using or running the model that we've developed we run the model to simulate the passage of time and explore the behavior of the modeled system this is similar to running an experiment in the lab students might run the experiment observe the behavior collect and analyze the data and develop explanations and or predictions based on their evidence similarly each time we use or run the model we observe the behavior gather the data and make an interpretation or calculation from that data so running a simulation is performing an experiment on your computer why would you want to run simulations on your computer i mean why not want run real experiments in the lab well there are a lot of reasons to run simulations once you develop the model you can run it many times with many different variables or parameters so you can thoroughly explore what you have modeled if you run your model and realize you left something important out then you can modify the model to include it once your model is developed it doesn't really cost you anything to run simulations except your time also you can develop models for situations where experimentation is too difficult perhaps running an experiment is too dangerous or maybe even impossible or maybe lab experiments are just too expensive or maybe experimentation would take too long like exploring the genetic drift of certain mammals so you can see that there are lots of reasons to explore some problems using computer models and simulation we can classify models many different ways one way is to classify models as deterministic or stochastic a deterministic model provides only one output for a set of inputs there's no randomness involved in the model you can think of it as the solution of a mathematical equation a stochastic model on the other hand can produce different outputs for a set of inputs you actually get a variety of outputs that's because some randomness is involved in your model the agentbased models of complex adaptive systems we will be using in our curriculum activities all include some randomness and therefore they are stochastic and produce distribution of possible outcomes repetition is important when using a stochastic model because for each set of input variables you may get somewhat different results you need to repeat the model at the same settings or with the same parameters to see the distribution of outcomes there are some similarities and differences between lab experiments and computational science experiments one experimental design in both lab and computational science is the design of controlled experiments these experiments are designed to produce evidence of causal relationships by isolating variables two in computational science experiments we can use abstraction and include only those factors and components we think are important three in computational science experiments we can change the underlying behavior of components whereas in real life this is rarely possible code is flexible four in computational science experiments we can use automation to repeat experiments easily quickly and exactly whereas in real life there is human error and replication of experiments is difficult five manipulations and observations of the real world can proceed or lead up to hypothesis building your experimentation might involve testing the whole space of variables called the parameter space to look for patterns that may lead to hypotheses rather than coming to the test bed with a hypothesis i hope this introduction to using computer models in scientific inquiry has given you a picture of why models and simulations are valuable tools in modern scientific research
