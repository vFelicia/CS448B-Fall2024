understanding coding is a weapon it's like a superpower is better than a superpower hi I'm Cari I work in fashion but I also consider myself a student I'm fascinated by understanding how things work I wanted to learn how the world of technology is built so I started to learn how to code in my spare time because it wasn't offered to me as a class when I was in school I grew up in a house with three sisters and all four of us were never encouraged to learn how to code and that's the one thing that I wish someone would have said just take one class I always thought I would be following My Father's Footsteps and going to Medicine my dad's a doctor and I love math I ended up having a career in fashion you know there's not much math that I use in my daytoday life for my work but I am fascinated by by Computer Sciences by understanding programming by understanding how things are built I happen to be a closeted super nerd so I personally have begun learning how to program on my own because programming is the language of the future and of now I wish I would have started learning at 13 but it doesn't matter how old you are you can always start learning jump into it learn just try and take one class give it one hour it's amazing what you can learn in 1 hour it's important to break that stigma of thinking that it's not cool to be smart if you can understand much less speak code you can build anything by the way the games are so much fun I spend so much time like playing with the different games that are probably targeted to like 12 year olds
