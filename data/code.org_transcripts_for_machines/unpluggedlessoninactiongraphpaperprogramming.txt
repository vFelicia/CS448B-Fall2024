so this first lesson we're going to do is using graphing in a very specific way and there's two really important words that we need to know for this lesson as we start it and they are conveniently up here algorithm have you heard that word before no will you say it with me then algorithm thank you does anyone have an idea what could algorithm mean hint hint it's on the wall sean is a set of um to solve a problem right it's a set of steps to solve a problem do you think you guys have ever used an algorithm before yeah yeah like what what what would it be what do you think axel um eight steps or the steps you read my mind i was thinking you guys have all done algorithms because of model drawing you're taking a big problem and you're breaking it down into little steps that are totally doable and then you see the whole process of getting there and you're doing algebra and you don't even know it and then the other word we need to know is program have you guys heard that word before it can mean a lot of different things for this very specific lesson cyan what do you think it means the algorithm that has been coded by a machine hey fantastic you took it right out of my brain again an algorithm that's been coded into something that can be run by a machine so an algorithm's a list of steps great you've got this list of steps but if you want a machine to do that list of steps for you you have to put it into code that the machine knows how to read it's like your dog needs commands to sit and walk and roll over and all that right that's the only anything about your computer that way too your computer needs specific commands to be able to follow a list of steps so before we get deeper into giving computers commands i am going to turn into a robot saw okay okay and i only follow specific instructions i have a very certain list of specific instructions that i follow and my goal as teacher robot is to fill in this graph so that it looks like a checkerboard or another way to think of it is every other square is filled in with blue pen so it started and then your job as a class is going to give me instructions and we'll do this together as a class and then you'll practice with each other so you all will become roblox too but i'll be the robot first i'll be teacher robot and then you'll be student robots so i've got a very specific set of commands voila that are right there so those are the only things that i can follow and my job is to fill in this chart this graph so that every other space is colored in so who can tell me what's this top one lorenzo move one square right okay what's the next one harry move one square left okay next one scion move one square up okay next one audrey move one skip a square down okay and the very last one arian fill in square with color okay so if i start here this is my starting point what would you tell me to do next this one is done for us but let's pretend it's not so let's pretend if i was starting here would you tell me move one scare right would you say move one square left would you say move one square down because i'm going to get here and then fill this in so from starting what would be the very first command what do you guys think talk with your table groups real quick and what would the first command be okay when you're ready to tell me about your pinky's in the air yeah like you're drinking tea okay so uh raeanne's table group will you tell me what's my first movement from the start move one square right okay i'm going to write that down move one square right okay i also can write and talk as a robot okay so i moved one square right what's my very next job robot command robot command command anya what do i do next fill and square with color okay so this is step two okay fill and square the color okay did that what's my very next what's my very next movement very next movement ethan okay so now i'm here move one square right and that's a lot of learning that's a lot of writing my robot arm is so tired of writing and making this pretty pattern on our graph i wonder what i could do to make the writing not so laborious not so difficult could i draw a symbol to represent what if we did this move one square right is an arrow moving right how about that okay how about move one square left left an arrow moving left okay and then here's the really tricky one move one square up okay and then what's the next one airplane okay and then what should i do for filling with colors it's like drawing time with color i could can i do like little scribbles and then maybe an arrow that's kind of funny meaning like scribble this one that you're on yeah does that make sense to you yeah so then if i was going to do another one with a different pattern it would be a lot less writing of the algorithm right right so before we do that as a class again i want you guys to practice so sometimes it's really tricky for kids to figure out which direction they should read or write instructions and for this age group i found it's really easy for them to just do it and figure it out together as a group or with their partner for younger ages though i would be specific about if it's left to right if you're making a column of instructions and that takes out that frustration when they're working together as a partner so another thing that's confusing to kids is the fill in square symbol because it's the fillin symbol and then there's a down arrow so kids sometimes think they need to move down to do that but what i explain to the kids is you're staying on that square and filling it in and the way i filled it on the board looks a lot like the symbol so that reinforces what it's instructing them to do so when we're thinking about that activity that we just did our commands are up here move right move left move up move down fill in color what if that last command wasn't fill in color but what if it was lay brick what could you use that for building building have you used that before have you guys ever played isn't that don't you lay bricks in minecraft yeah just click left i thought you just run around that's that's essentially what you're doing though too right you're moving around and then you're laying a brick down instead of filling in color so little did you know you were doing an algorithm for minecraft does that make sense do you guys have questions jack how is it computer programming if it's on a piece of paper right we're not using a computer how does that work so one of the biggest things of computer programming is something called computational thinking and it's like it's training your brain to pay attention to what you do every day in your life you take big problems and you break them down into small pieces that you can solve that's what computational thinking is and it's figuring out ways that you can solve any kind of problem either with other people or alone or for any kind of reason so if you're training your brain to think that way without a computer when you start working on computer and working in coding with computers you're set up for anything you want to do it's like the math you're learning in fourth grade you'll be amazing when you do algebra and calculus in high school and college because you've got that foundation that's what the computational thinking is that's what we're doing now
