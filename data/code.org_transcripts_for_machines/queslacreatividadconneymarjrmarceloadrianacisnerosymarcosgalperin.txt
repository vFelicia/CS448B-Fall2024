Creativity is giving yourself the luxury of thinking big, with discipline. Creativity means to me to have the ability to implement any idea and to make it into and transform it into a useful idea. Creativity is what allowed me to think outside the box and use the technology that I had in my hands in order to change peopleâ€™s lives. The champions of the future will be the creators. Creativity is creating something that is difficult for you, making it easier, and being able to be a little crazier. Creativity is the first step to changing things. Creativity is not thinking about the limits. What do you want to create? What will you create? #HourofCode Subtitles by the Amara.org community
