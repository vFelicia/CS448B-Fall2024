An ifelse statement is a decision between two things. For example, IF Scrat the squirrel finds the acorn, then he's happy. ELSE he's sad, and keeps searching. Now let's see how we can use an ifelse statement with our buddy Scrat. This block looks the same as the "if" block, but there's an extra part on the bottom that says "else". If I put a "move forward" block where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else", that means Scrat the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a path ahead, Scrat will turn left. It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that decision. And just like "if" blocks, you can put "ifelse" blocks inside "repeat" blocks. Now let's help Scrat the squirrel get that acorn!
