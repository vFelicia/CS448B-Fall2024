My name is MayLi Khoe and I'm a designer and an inventor so some of the things I've designed have been at Apple and now I design products for kids to use so that they can have an easier time in school my other jobs include DJing and dancing as the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a thinking machine they realized that it had to perform four different tasks it would need to take input store information process it and then output the results now this might sound simple but these four things are common to all computers that's what makes a computer a computer first we're going to talk about input this is my favorite because what input is is the stuff that the world does or that you do that makes the computer do stuff you can tell computer what to do with keyboard you can tell them what to do with a mouse the microphone the camera and now if you're wearing a computer on your wrist it might listen to your heartbeat or in your car it might be listening to what the car is doing and a touchscreen can actually sense your finger and it takes that as input on what it's doing all these different inputs give a computer information which is then stored in memory a computer's processor takes information from memory it manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm which is just a series of commands and then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again this continues until the processed information is ready to be output how a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do a computer display can show text photos videos or interactive games even virtual reality the output of a computer may even include signals to control a robot and when computers connect over the Internet the output from one computer becomes the input to another and vice versa but across all computers regardless of the different types of technology they use they're old as those doing the same for things they take in information they store it as data they process it and then they output the results
