here is our 2d array to access a row start by listing the name of the array followed by a set of square brackets with an index for example cindy's quiz scores are located at index 2 of the outer array to get her answers to the quiz we simply type quiz course brackets 2. if we want to access an individual answer on cindy's quiz we add a second set of square brackets and include the index that corresponds to the answer we want to check so quiz scores brackets 2 bracket 0 represents cindy's answer to the first question on the quiz to modify an element we use the same notation but this time we add the assignment operator in the new updated value let's change daniel's third answer first we type quiz course brackets three brackets two that takes us to the fourth row and third column then type gets value c this will change his third answer from d to c be very careful with indexing and make sure to always start counting at zero for both the row and the column accessing and modifying elements in a 2d array is very similar to working with a 1d array we can even implement the same algorithms to work with 2d arrays you
