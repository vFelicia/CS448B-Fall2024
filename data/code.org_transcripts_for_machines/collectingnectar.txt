Aren't bees super cool? In this next set of puzzles, your goal is to help the bee get to the flowers and get nectar from the flowers and fly over to the honeycomb to make honey. You'll need to use the "get nectar" and the "make honey" blocks for this exercise. Every flower has a different number of nectars 1, 2, 3, or more. We know how much nectar is in the red flowers, by the little number in the corner. So be sure to get all the nectar from the flower before you move forward. Also, every honeycomb can only hold so much honey 1, 2, 3, or more. So be sure to make as much honey as the honeycomb can hold. If you're able to get all the nectar and make all the honey, you succeed and go to the next level. Otherwise, you need to try this puzzle again. Play around a while and see what it feels like to "bee" a programmer!
