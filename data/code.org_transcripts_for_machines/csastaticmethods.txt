calling methods from a class typically requires an object to be created first these methods are called instinct methods an instance method is a method that requires an object of this class to be created before it can be called sometimes we have methods that don't use any instance variables and don't depend on a specific object these can use static methods a static method is a method that can be called without creating an instance of a class static methods are designed to be shared by all objects created from the class they are often used to access static variables we assess a static method using the name of the class instead of the name of the object let's say we have a food truck class it has a static variable that keeps track of how many food trucks have been created we shouldn't need to create a food truck object to increase the number of food trucks we can add a static method to the food truck class to increase the number of food trucks by 1 when it's called when we write the method signature we add the keyword static in front of the return type in the body of the method we can increase our static variable num chucks by one to call this method we state the name of the class dot the name of the method static methods only have access to static variables and other static methods they cannot change or access the values of instance variables for example if our food truck class has an instant variable called name then a static method attempting to change the name will cause an error the static method does not have access to instance variables because instance variables belong to specific objects these methods are useful when we need to access static variables or perform attacks that do not require an object you
