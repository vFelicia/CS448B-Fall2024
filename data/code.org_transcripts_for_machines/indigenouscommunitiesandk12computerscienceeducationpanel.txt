all right so i think everyone's in from the waiting room uh i want to let everyone know right now that uh there is a group of folks from la that are taking part or in la that are taking part of c with cs edcon um so we have an inperson and a virtual audience here it's just everyone kind of knows what's going on um for those of you that are online if you or actually i'll add this to the chat for some instructions for how you may want to rename yourself to help us keep track of things um and are we all good to get going okay awesome um so hello everyone um we're welcome to our panel uh my name is ian her many horses i am the moderator i'm an assistant teaching professor at cu boulder and i focus on computer science ed and mathed and kind of the whole spectrum of uh things within education i work with preservice teachers in my role at cu boulder but then also do you know uh pd support for practicing teachers and then work with k12 students as well and i'm gonna let each of our panelists introduce themselves uh i see elizabeth first so maybe we could start off with you all right um hello everybody my name is elizabeth holm i'm the founder of sonak which is the sisterhood of native american coders but usually we just kind of shorten it to sonar because it's kind of a mouthful um yeah and uh i guess just kind of a little bit of background i've been coding and kind of been an advocate for uh women in stem for the past seven years um and yeah and i started sonar because i wanted to kind of connect my my passion with stem with my indigenous ancestry so that's just kind of a bit of background uh zoe would you mind going next um no islands nor scotland nor togo um is the mountain i grew up under waipa the river i grew up beside i'm from aotearoa new zealand my ancestors are from ireland scotland and togo i'm a tawiwi in aotearoa and i'm committed to the partnership of fertility of waitangi i'm the founder of omg tech and i acknowledge the tangata of the area that i'm on today um orangey tech is a charity in aotearoa new zealand that was established about seven years ago to ensure every child or young person gets access to the technology that shapes their future we have a focus on ensuring young people can think creatively critically computationally and culturally and we believe that exploring all of our own indigeneity is the key to a prosperous future for everybody thank you jen would you mind going next yes happy to hello everybody my name is jennifer flanagan i am joining from the traditional unseated territory of the algonquin people uh i also called ottawa uh ontario canada so the capital of canada and i'm the ceo of an organization called actua we are a national uh charitable organization that engages youth in building the skills and confidence they need to thrive in in stem but generally across the board we specifically focus on removing barriers that continue to exist for participation in these fields and our largest program is the work that we do in partnership with uh indigenous communities so first nations inuit and metis communities across canada so very happy to be here yes yeah you go for it so i just greeted you in my native language when you're back uh hey everyone my name is frida or you can call me nick which is my new black name i'm here on traditional territories of the sean and chichen yoloni people i'm going to go ahead and drop the shumi land tax link into the chat if you live in the bay area if you've been in the bay area you don't have to be in the bay area to support uh indigenous rematriation of the land so um that's one way to do it as an as an ally um so yeah i've been with the kport center for nearly seven years it'd be seven years in january and uh for the past two of them have been coleading a project with the american indian science and engineering society similar to elizabeth i've been working with native girls in computing the model's slightly different we're working to bring in culturally revitalizing computing education curricula into native serving schools designed specifically to engage native girls um and i came to that work because um i did my cs and bachelor's my bachelor's in cs and it was as a native american woman as a native alaskan woman it was so challenging in so many different ways and so to understand that i started to work on better representation for black and other indigenous people and women in stem and mcs all right thank you all um so we'll get into our first question uh quick reminder the goal is three minutes a piece and we'll kind of round robin it so the first question is in your experience what has been the biggest challenge of doing cs ed work with and or in indigenous communities and i'll throw that in the chat as well to help you anybody like to take that on first i'm happy to go first if you want awesome thank you uh great so um from uh and obviously speaking from a canadian context um you know we we've got two uh pretty significant challenges i mean many challenges but two in particular that i'm going to speak about one is this that i think will be very common among panelists and certainly understood among among the audience which is just a a significant and growing digital divide so you know straight up access we know that you know the the access to the internet is it's been designated by the un as a human right um and you know canada is obviously a very super developed country but we still have massive access issues so rural remote communities only about half have actual access to um highspeed broadband and in our indigenous communities across the country about threequarters of them don't have access to a reliable internet so that's just internet access then technology and hardware is is a whole other whole other challenge so one that we kind of work around so we do a lot of unplugged activities in in computer science and through the pandemic this has been massively exacerbated because of the challenges of connecting to communities that we normally connect with face to face to do this content where we bring in technology um really not being able to do that the other piece is around um the cultural uh divide and the in the the the ongoing focus which is still important on access and um and physical infrastructure which is needed but uh a real lack of focus on uh you know how we build from the very core build in indigenous perspective and leadership in how content and computing systems are actually designed so a big um part of the work that we're doing is really to uh create a platform and space for um you know changing the way that cs education has developed so that the unique and critical perspectives of of indigenous people are uh brought into it many of the indigenous communities we work with are um uh you know nervous or uh kind of resisting in terms of the the digital um evolution and and for good reason because they don't see themselves in it and and certainly from a youth perspective they're uh in canada anyway there's a huge focus on revitalizing and maintaining and celebrating traditional culture and language um so that that's a big um a big gap that we're also uh working very actively to to address through the way that we incorporate multiple world views in the programming that we deliver i'll leave it there thank you would anybody else like to jump in again the the question is in your experience what has been the biggest challenge of doing cs ed work with and or in indigenous communities um i can hop in next if you like um and apologies my my voice is a little bit uh shaky because we're a little under the weather right now but um yeah so i guess one of the um the big issues is having kind of a concentrated um initial interest in so you know there's obviously two formats of in person and online or like a resume um and sonar personally um so we teach indigenous girls um around the country how to code and we are an online based uh platform um but uh what we found is that there's there's there's quite a diverse um kind of range of uh girls from um you know they're from a bunch of different tribes um but that also uh kind of shows us that there's not a lot of um you know there's not a concentrated interest in cs um uh in you know one specific area or tribe it can be maybe one to two girls per area um and i think for cs programs um in general i think it's really important to have a um kind of that in person connection and be coding alongside other girls that's kind of like what makes it engaging and fun um but i think on with the online platform it can be a little bit tough to do that um but you kind of have to to strike a balance between um having that that more engaging inperson program um and like kind of working with your peers um but also native communities usually don't have enough interest to make a substantial program within one area or tribe um so i feel like that's something that we've kind of uh we've overcome with the online format um bringing together girls onto a virtual space but it's been definitely hard to um kind of have that that connection that you usually would um with a traditional kind of cs or stem program where they're doing projects together working alongside each other and kind of um helping each other out and making those those computer science triumphs together um yeah so it can definitely be a tough balance between uh the the group work and that kind of collaboration um and also kind of bringing together um native communities but um yeah i'm gonna go ahead and jump in and piggyback off of what has already been said just from like a very basic like native perspective i feel like native communities are still undergoing quite a lot of genocide and that's not something i'm sure that's new to the native folks here but that's not the narrative that's discussed in education often so what i tend to talk about is that my mother was a boarding school survivor um this is something that you know impacted her life um and and lifespan and has impacted me as intergenerational trauma um so we don't often like see education in schooling as part of that narrative of colonization um and so we're tending to couch it in different terms right you know you can hear terms about a cultural difference or um you know this kind of lack of access of things which is true um but seeing from a native perspective these are all parts of the ways that we're still enduring under difficult conditions right under conditions of colonization so um you know that can be some of our school sites have had you know issues like uh environmental disasters you know over this past year um you know fires when there shouldn't be fires or floods when they're normally not floods um you know tornadoes um that they've never had so you know they're they're going through a lot just on a physical level even um that's disrupting a lot of their school life as well and just their their family structure um so so that's part of it i think the cultural part that um elizabeth and jen talked about i mean i think the the thing that we're seeing um on the ground with the schools that we're working with is that there's a huge interest on the part of the native students to connect with their traditional cultures and again school has often been the opposite experience for them right of being acculturated and assimilated into different disciplines that are led by uh by white folks but here we're trying to try to try to integrate uh traditional knowledges on a tribytribe basis um into computing curricula and that means working much more closely with the tribe and understanding their concerns their desires for their kids their their young people um what do they want to see for their future um and how do they want to see them in the world so it's a very different approach and i think um you know really tries to to get to grips with this reversing this um the colonization aspect of school trying to at least get at some of that um you can't completely in a goal setting probably for lots of reasons but trying at least to bring back language bring back traditions in some cases you know the tribes were working with were matriarchies originally before colonization right so working with native girls um is is a part of that focus of well this is actually a traditional part of your tribe in some cases um so yeah this is these are some of the things that we're trying to bring into the work but i appreciate all that everyone said it's it's definitely i'm just trying to frame it in a way i think if there are any native folks on the call um joining us today that that they'll maybe understand a little bit of what what we're trying to do zoe go ahead and jump in okay yeah so just to um total call that um for us and aotearoa the biggest problem of cs education is that it's a microcosm of the biggest problem in general education and that is our education systems are incredibly colonized and until we and you can't just think around the edges and change a few things 90 percent of our indigenous and young people go to school in mainstream schools so we have maori um kotakobapa which are incredible places of learning but the majority of our indigenous young people don't get to have that kind of education and so until we really look at not just culturally responsive practice in education but culturally sustaining where our young people have success as maori um themselves and that's not success maori being successful at success as maori success as samoan is tongan in these spaces and our teaching workforce is on a really big journey and we're very fortunate in aotearoa that um our ministry of education has recognized this and is putting focus into it but it's a really big thing to look at and face into all of our own unconscious biases how that plays out and what we value in education and there's a really cool bit of work by dr ann milne who is a lead educator in aotearoa around coloring in the white spaces and she's got a one for digital that looks at coloring in your digital white spaces which is a training course to make you really face into how much your whole school the way that your website looks the way everything looks is recolonizing our students and so for us the biggest challenge is just the biggest educational challenge how do we ensure that everything we're doing isn't recolonizing and doing more harm how are we from um how we've been critical of ourselves and our teaching and we work with a large percentage of schools in our theater i'm looking at that question looking at how do we all continue to um because it has to be the mainstream and we can't just we can't just tinker and create little bits here anymore because it's about every young person um yeah so i think that would be for us the biggest challenge in cs biggest challenge in everything if i could also just jump in um i feel like a really important part of designing the cs curriculum or stem curriculum is to incorporate that indigenous kind of heritage and culture into it um you know it could be something as small as using an indigenous word as an example um like if you're if you just have to plug in some random word um it could be some indigenous word um but i think yeah a really important part of kind of maintaining that heritage is kind of a an easy integration between um between the like kind of indigenous side and the stem side because they don't they don't have to be separate um and uh in doing that you can kind of show them how they can apply uh what they're learning in cs or stem backed into their communities and kind of connecting it back to their own their own heritage thank you all i'm gonna try to pull us up now from here where like challenges are daunting in a way but that we have to have successes that come out of these right and we're working within these systems and you know there are bright shining lights so what has been the greatest success you have seen either in your own organization's work or in the larger work with cs education in indigenous communities anybody that wants to jump in i can't i could go first again um okay i love what what all the other panelists said so much and and just in canada for example um you know we're working on a massive we canada is working on a massive reconciliation um priority or focus it's a huge as it is in other jurisdictions in the world a huge uh topic of conversation and energy and momentum and we specifically design and build our work around the recommendations that came out of a large commission called the truth and reconciliation commission there were over 90 calls to action for the government to to take on and a section of that was around education and language preservation um and so we worked directly under the direction of of leaders um in this country we also sort of work at both ends of some of my colleagues on the panel have spoken about we take the view of one kid at a time one child at a time because it's overwhelming there's so so much work to do but one child at a time but also how do we change the system we can't do the work unless we're working as well on the system we also as an organization can't do the work unless we as an organization walk the reconciliation talk ourselves so that means in you know significant indigenous representation from our board to our staff to the people that we work with on the ground to the companies that we work with so our programs are all led by indigenous undergraduate students across the country so that has been a huge success for us because it is there's a huge amount of competition for those students um and um so we have been able to engage a lot of them in the delivery of these programs um and we've been doing this work for goodness since i was in undergraduate like 25 years ago and what our goal is is to build a continuum of support for these youth so they might see a workshop in a school they might have a summer program in digital skills and stem in their community then they have the opportunity to see us again at school they then as they get older can become an instructor or a volunteer in one of our programs and we're now actually taking that a step further where um we're doing landbased programming it's a huge area of focus for us so actually um taking our our content and going out with youth uh for 15 days it's just an example where youth are getting high school credits so they're actually getting formal school credits they are being paid to then kind of mentor and do the work with younger youth they're getting leadership training and then the step after that is that we actually work to get them internships uh like work integrated learning type things so that could be with a corporation that they're interested in that could be with a local communitybased organization so it's recognizing that you know we we do if we want to see the kind of systems change that we're out for have to provide that support along the way and all of it all of it is at the direction and design of our indigenous partners and our indigenous staff so it we're changing the system as we deliver the programming on the ground thank you uh who would like to go in next in terms of sharing uh greatest success or positive things you're seeing in cs and indigenous communities i'll just add one tiny thing i think um yeah i mean we we we definitely it's been challenging getting this started over the pandemic um but i would say that something that gives me a lot of heart is part of part of the challenge of the pandemic has been that students were working at home the first year um and so all of our classes were virtual and you know they we had to send kits individually home for them to work on on their cs projects but one of the beauty points of that was that they actually had a chance to show their relatives and often it lived in intergenerational households so it was like aunties and grandparents also seeing what they could do with these led light strips they got to play with or make bead work on or you know had had their culturally you know at the time we were using the culturally relevant model of curriculum development not culturally revitalizing um but yes they they enjoyed showing um off what they could do and and one student in a sharing circle we had on the site um the end of last year had said that when he was you know doing his project in his room or you know out in the living room somebody came by his you know his auntie came by and said you know what are you doing and watched him do his thing watch the lights blink and flash and and how he was explaining you know how it worked and um she just looked at him and said yeah good make it think like an apache you know like make that computer think like an apache and that was such a beautiful moment for us as a team because we realized that you know this is an opportunity for um for elders for for uh family members for parents uh for intergenerational learning to happen for younger siblings um to get a chance to be exposed to this at the same time and it's a more sort of community wide effect than we would have seen otherwise um so really appreciated that comment from that auntie um and also just the vision that it gave us right the sort of alignment it gave us about what we were trying to do right in terms of what elizabeth was talking about and and others here talking about using indigenous languages and coding um you know there's no need for it to be in english right it comes down to binary code at the end of the day so um you know coding in their language things like that that they can show others um that they're learning how to do two things at the same time makes makes their families incredibly proud yeah thank you i like that that is a particular challenge right where there's you know there's not a lot of visibility of computer science within the communities right there's a recognition that it's important and we want students to expose it but raising that level of understanding across the entire community is always a challenge um and so yeah the little blessing underneath the mess of the pandemic there uh zoey elizabeth uh greatest things you you've seen going on successes i see you muted go ahead um so in aotearoa one of the biggest successes generally has been around language revitalization as a tool for cultural revitalization so um the maori people of aotearoa almost lost their language completely and there was a big effort generally for language revitalization and the 80s that was really flourishing now a lot of work we do feeds onto that that freda was just talking about that the computers don't speak english computers speak binary and we speak english to computers and that um there's an awful lot of ideas that cannot be translated into english because they just don't exist in it particularly coming from our indigenous people and so we do a lot of work um around identity and computing around being really critical of what you're being served up in a digital space and when you're creating with technology and we have an indigenous game design course that unpacks the values that exist in technology we find that really successful with young people using gaming as a tool to look at the fact that technology is not valueless it's not this cold artifact that it has and represents the values of the people that created it and so for our wider whanau mindset we talk a lot about whose values do you want represented and the things that are controlling our future so i'm looking at how our health care system will work as technology comes into it more and more as our democracy works and then where do these value systems come from and often we talk about the difference between american values and the private health care sector versus aotearoa where we have a public health care sector and what's that robot that's caring for your auntie or your um grandma going to look like and how is it going to interact because like you said like give it an apache mindset give it a pacific mindset because they're very different and the idea of what that technology should do is comes from a different place and so we've found a lot of success in helping our indigenous communities really understand they can they can change technology to be representative of themselves and the first stage of that has been around that deconstruction of it and being able to say for our particularly for our young people they hop into these video games that fortnight what are the values represented in that and how do they align to who you are and are you becoming a different person in the digital world from who you are and how would you fix that like what would you do instead and so our young people create the most incredible um games in the world they're just super cool because they're representative and they're being allowed to represent themselves and then the other side of that is around the resource creation um and we've heard lots of people mention it so we've done a lot of work as the code or partner in aotearoa and working alongside microsoft for years to translate the hour of code site into today maori we believe that for our young people their first experience coding should be in their indigenous language this year we're going to be translating into some of our pacifica languages as well because that also allows them to take that back into their homes for their aunties and their parents and their grandparents who have these traditional who speak first language and indigenous languages and so then they can share in that because it's quite a big gap that whanau connection to technology can be very big so that's kind of where our biggest success has been and is really just that helping our young people be critical of the technology that they're served up and create better solutions thank you i really i like the idea of like your first experience should be something that is of you right something where where you come from right this can be part of you uh awesome uh elizabeth uh would you like to share a great success you're seeing within your work or in other's work that you're noticing yeah sure um i mean i think uh jen might have mentioned um kind of looking at things on an individual level um like each individual um girl i think one of the the greatest successes or i guess the most rewarding moments is um when you see that kind of that moment of switch um in the girls when their eyes just light up um and they see uh the code running and doing that kind of computer magic right before their eyes i think um they kind of they have this moment of um like i did that i'm smart i'm capable i'm a coder um and i think that moment is really just it's what all coders live for but i think like particularly as an educator that is just such a rewarding moment um and i think to be able to create that moment in as many girls as possible is really the goal of um of sonic and other you know kind of cs education programs um i think through sonak we've been able to genuinely change some girls outlook on stem and with even just one girl we can kind of start a chain of the next generation of indigenous female innovators in stem so i feel like even though it seems small to to change just one girl's mindset you know they're gonna pass that on to their little sister or their friend um or when they get older maybe they'll start a program kind of similar to sonak um to spread their their passion so i think um those those individual sparks they seem sometimes you know they seem a little bit on a smaller scale but they can really start a wildfire um and i think that's probably one of the the biggest impacts that we can have yeah like we in like these very formal informal roles right but in some way where we're separated right and that peer support or that peer guidance and like what could this mean for you my friend or my cousin or whoever uh is just so powerful and we just we just can't speak and have those conversations in the positions that we're in in a lot of times um yeah so incredibly powerful uh okay so i want to we're we're gonna jen do you have a comment oh i just wanted to say one more thing that is kind of like that in terms of sparks like one of the the most amazing things that happened and this is prepandemic we'll get back this summer i hope but um we deliver uh programming with the 24 communities across nunavut which is one of our northern arctic territories um with inuit uh people and we it's delivered completely and inducted to it or it's delivered in english but translated completely and enough to it as well some of the kids understand some of them are just learning some of them don't understand it all but they're you know they're they're getting there and we always have local elders engaged in our programs and for the last few years um we have had like the most incredible experiences having elders become so engaged in the content and in fact as they're doing it are kind of coteaching so they're they're taking the you know the cultural lessons and sort of laying those on top of the work that our team is is delivering around stem or around you know digital skills um and it's just it's incredibly it's incredibly powerful but it is just uh it to me one of the biggest things that we need to continue to facilitate is that intergenerational multigenerational uh experience and where we just sort of create the space and um you know the the rest happens at at the community level yeah community is a driving thing here right like you get the community on board and it becomes part of them um thank you all i'm going to transition us to questions now uh i'm going to first pivot to the people in the room at cs edcon uh are there any questions from that space you all hear us still yes very clear one second my question is is is there any organization organization out there that is working with the tribal elders getting their input or the tribal leaders um i know there's a lot of work at the school level but i think there'd be more success if the elders were included in a lot of these decisions yeah yeah i mean that's a little bit what i was alluding to when we talked about cultural revitalization you can't do that without elders and culture bearers and language bearers um and i think they they play a critical role in and part of what we're trying to do here what some of us have talked about just building something new in place of colonial education um something more holistic communitybased indigenous center and indigenous world view center and so yeah that's definitely what cultural revitalization has brought brought to my program um is more work with the folks who immediately when you meet them they want to tell you stories immediately when you meet them they're you know they're excited because we're both native and you know when you meet them they're just um they're brimming with the the possibilities for what you know what we can do together you know how how we can how we can move forward you know um and taking their community their young folks on a journey with them um to reconnect with those parts of the past that we want to bring with us you know so i think that's those are those are the folks that we that we work with in the tribal communities that we're with and and part of that is the tribal governance itself so one of our tribal partners has a culture committee you know we're working with them to create some of the cultural pieces in other areas it's more it's you know they have a culture and language curriculum inside of the school and we're working with the teachers uh there so it just depends on the community um but yeah absolutely elders are critical they're a critical part of the of the vision for sure thank you for the question so in aotearoa we're very fortunate with our new education changes that they are they've said every school has to go work with the manufa the local people of the area but one thing that we would say is that often that work is seen as being free cultural labor that there's an expectation that the local tribes should for free come every single time they're asked and provide that knowledge over and over again which isn't right and isn't true so when anyone's planning this stuff we have to think about how we're valuing um that knowledge and that relationship and who should be doing the work and how much education we have to do ourselves first before we just go ask so that's a really big that's currently where we are today and new zealanders going on that journey of how do we value that and not just expect it um because it's not like they're getting paid to do it so how do we pay for that knowledge if we want it in many ways i cosigned that the payment part is usually forgotten in those things yeah we built it into our grant but it's definitely something to you know to keep reminding folks of that there's a real value to indigenous knowledge of all fields and all types yeah we we have long been paying for elder engagement and um you know at any time it's never it it's never a question um just to the to the question that was asked um and i'll share the link but we last year did a series of um roundtables right across the country with um elders and knowledge keepers and and chiefs and council and all forms of different leadership to talk about um landbased learning specifically and how landbased learning and stem and and coding could all come together um not just for indigenous youth but for for all youth um uh and that a report was produced out of that in terms of you know that that kind of voice being captured and then our role is then to share that up to the the leadership whether that's the the at the government level federally so or provincially where education is held in canada so i'm happy to share the findings of that report so uh we'd like to take the next question from the zoom room i put it in the chat but just wanted to give a shout out if anyone has one they may feel free to unmute and ask a question um otherwise i'll give you all a question and we also have a second question from the room if you want to take that one too from l.a okay uh let's take the question from la anyone in the zoom room uh please feel free to throw something in there and we'll we'll do our best to get to it we still have some time here for for questions hi thank you um this my name is jeremy i'm faculty at the university of arizona uh also a member of the hopi tewa community so i appreciate your insight i really actually uh value the idea of thinking critically and how we take up this particular kind of work in our communities and i really appreciate the the sort of the centering and reminding us of the intersections between settler colonialism and that history but also uh the possibilities of what this kind of work holds so i'm brand new to this so i really appreciate the dialogue that you're shaping for me it meshes well for what for me in terms of critical indigenous pedagogies and um you know culturally sustaining pedagogies as well so my actually my question is revolves around what are the sort of the processes in which you engage the ethical uh balance in terms of what knowledge should should or shouldn't be included in this process and how is that protected in terms of uh under the lens of let's say maybe sovereignty or tribal uh selfdetermination etc i'm chomping at the bit to answer this this is something that we were really a native womanled team in my project and we were really wanting to know what were the protocols for that tribe before we started incorporating knowledge and language and it came up in some of our earlier conversations for some tribes using their language in a computer machine context doesn't doesn't work it's they don't um they don't want their language to be used that way which we have to respond i mean that makes total sense right um how did colonizers get all of our stuff and keep it right they use technology so we didn't have so you know i think there's this this question you know about like where are the lines and we always want to respect those um we also had uh conversations you know about you know specific aspects of the language so is it like words is it the syllabary is it both you know we want to be very clear um with folks and we we respect their protocols you know 100 and i think it's to i think it was zoe's point where we have to learn ourselves we're coming from outside as well we're from different tribes so you know when we go and approach people we have to read up about their culture and their language and their ways you know when i go to the muscular apache i i'm not pointing with my finger you know to anyone um so there's different things that you have to ground yourself in even if you're just another native person just from another another part of turtle island so yeah for sure 100 um we have we have to engage with protocol very seriously and and make that part of our um a very gentle relational approach like you know we approach people as other people we engage with them nontransactionally we give them the time they need to respond to us to come you know back with what they need um if we can help them we will and you know we keep offering so you know i mean there's just there's there's a lot of working in native communities i think for nonnative people isn't intuitive um and so that's that's something that we try to make a different experience uh for working with us um so data sovereignty is huge in this space and we're very fortunate um microsoft is just committed to building a data center in aotearoa because most of our cloudbased data goes offshore constantly and when we think about where that knowledge is traveling and that localized control over um particularly our indigenous knowledge our whakapapa um so there's they've committed to my understanding as they've committed to creating a section of the data center in aotearoa specifically for the holding of indigenous knowledge in new zealand so that that knowledge will never leave the shores of aotearoa won't digitally travel back and forth which is um due to the incredible work within microsoft of some amazing indigenous leaders who really understand the narratives and the need behind it so um i would say there are some people out there in some of our large organizations that really get and are really exploring these ideas around how and where indigenous knowledge should be transmitted um we do a lot of work with our indigenous community specifically around understanding ip around understanding how data travels online like where it is what does that mean once you've put something because particularly for our young people they share so much without really comprehending what that means in terms of their own assets and then on another note like even the work that we do around translation and even with the work we've done with the hour of code um there is no one maori language there is we have different languages in every tribe and so even in these spaces we're almost colonizing with one tribe the tribes that we work with our translations on becomes the standard online and that's still not right because there are so many different ways of saying and being and so i think that we all need to consistently put pressure in these systems to really understand what the indigenous space is in technology and how we allow that to be reflected not just with a here are the flags of countries but actually being able to understand the nuance of um you know that we one other project we worked on is we have a tokulawan community here to class an island in the pacific that is on the endangered language list and we worked we've been working for three years with the elders and the young people of the atahu tukolau community in porirua to develop a language app because they see technology as a great revitalization tool but it's really hard to consistently take all of the ways of being and working out of working alongside our indigenous elders that don't have experiences in tech and even though we've built language apps with other indigenous people even though our indigenous developers had to still take themselves out to really explore and understand that indigenous knowledge like what is it to learn when you're from the island of a tahoe how do the elders want to communicate that without assuming that it's these ways of being so it just takes a huge amount of self i guess awareness to do this work for people in the space and i think everyone has to be constantly aware of what they're bringing into it so that they don't dominate it yeah i just want to admit this is a conversation that's been happening with the natives in tech around data sovereignty and it is also part of like an infrastructure issue right on one hand we we talk about the cultural knowledge and how that gets incorporated into educational systems but how do we ensure that you know tribal tribal citizens and tribal systems have physical control over what they choose to use and really have that in place so it's you know physical systems it's also you know right maybe a first refusal or licenses around data and these are things that i think are necessary to kind of be brought up to speed around you know what happens in the greater publishing or technological world around how we share things and and use other people's stuff open source is kind of a gold standard within the software community well maybe not gold standard i'm a huge fan of open source uh but that that doesn't quite work when we talk about protecting you know our own knowledge spaces and how we want things to work and how we want people to be able to take them up or not take them up and there's a really cool company aho who's a they're an amazing indigenous data company in aotearoa and they even looking at things like whakapapa which is your ancestors um and that idea that there's no empty fields it's not missing knowledge that your whakapapa is there and it exists and how that but that also your whakapapa can be disagreed on within the tribe and what truth is and data because computer science is so binary but actually these ideas and these structures for data storage and whose truth is right and valid even within a very your own tribe is it's a really interesting space that um will again radically transform what our data what computers look like for the better i think ian i just popped a resource to you into the chat around uh there's an organization in british columbia um called the first nations uh technology council and they're doing a lot of work around digital equity but also including like spectrum sovereignty so like who who actually owns the kind of like space in the internet and and um you know we're working actually to to do some programming around actually getting kids to understand that so that they can start to to understand that kind of potential uh in the future so i put the link in the chat thank you and that's technology council dot ca slash indigenous dash leadership dash in tech technology um for those of you in the room uh and i think we might be able to share something out like that later and i i also want to so you brought up an interesting thing where like what is right and what isn't and in some ways right like i can i can kind of speak for my people where there is no really right or wrong right there is this is what i was taught and part of the cultural thing is you know okay that's what you were taught and i acknowledge that and i'm not going to tell you you're wrong and so it's it's a remnant of colonization in some spaces to say this is right or wrong and that that is difficult interesting all of the things to navigate when we talk about trying to standardize and share and make something that works for everybody so it's kind of blows up a lot of a lot of things that we think are standard assumptions uh and i think we have a question from the chat and i think it'd be great to and from penny are you able to ask your question yes i am um so thank you um i am in north dakota um i work on a um at a small tribal school and we are at the very beginning of this whole process um we had issues with um internet when the pandemic hit um we just recently got um enough devices to be one to one with our students but what would you guys recommend be the first steps that we take um because i mean we do not have a lot of teachers i mean we're short teachers this year um being able to staff positions to teach these things because i mean a lot of the schools are already behind in reading and math and i know that reading and math can be taught within um cs curriculum but what what would you guys recommend be those first steps that so that we can move in the right direction sorry i'm out of breath we have parent teacher conferences and i just had a parent walk in so um but go ahead you want to take that up first first steps you think people could take where you know they may be under resourced or you know trying to figure out how to start um well i mean i think one of the the beauties of the um like the internet and kind of the um yeah the the amount of resources that we have there um is that we have access to a lot of um you know free uh online kind of teaching resources there's khan academy um there's like various things um and i think that is definitely one thing that we could um like you guys could utilize going forward to kind of fill in those gaps um you know those kind of recordings of you know someone else teaching it um but i think it is definitely hard because you know not every student has the same access to tech um and that's kind of one of the issues that that we face in indigenous communities is that access to um a computer or the internet um so i think those online resources are a great um a great way to kind of fill in those gaps if you can um like if you have access to the internet um and those those resources but um i think there's definitely it's a tough tough issue to solve if you have access to the internet it's a great place to start that's easy as hour of code um we start all our schools off with that but it's a selfled for your students and there's so many of them on there and it's super rich but it is very what it is when we work with schools we always do projects so just projectbased learning outside of everything else give them something they can connect to in their community and just let them think about a solution and they don't have to build a technology solution but if they're exploring some of those concepts um we do a lot of stuff around like you know if we've got assistive issues in our school or environmental issues is there a stream is there a something that um they can think about and then depending on the age of the kids we do a lot of game design because kids love making games and again there's lots of free resources out there we use scratch we try to use only free stuff i know in america my understanding is it's a little bit different of what tech you can use in your school so there's a bit but we and i'll tell we can just say use go use this and you can just do it the level of state control is i guess a little bit less um but yeah scratch is super cool um the code.org stuff is amazing for selfled stuff for your students but really you have to get their hearts and get them interested in that with something that they're passionate about so projectbased stuff that takes all of that other stuff into account i would say annie what age are your kids four grades um we actually are a prek we have two schools within our building um we are a um prek through eighth grade and then we also have a a public high school that is also on our reservation awesome i mean we'd be interested in talking about partnering in high school so i mean that's one that's one thing is partnerships um because there are groups and orgs um and projects like mine um designed now now that like natives are trending um in our fields um there's there's unprecedented opportunity stuff i wish had been around when i was growing up um the other thing i would say and this gets back to what others have said is that yeah i would see what their interests are and go with what they already like doing with technology often it is gaming um like was said but i think um everyone's a gamer at all ages always um no matter what the game but i i do think yeah um going and polling them to as as as kids and and seeing where their interest is um as well as online resources um trying to think i know that there are curriculum models out there um trying to think of some of the bigger ori project lead the way i know um has been doing a lot as well there's just so many shops out there i know that ecs is also applicable to elementary and middle school kids um and i know that there's like a version of that in code.org um but also the ecs team in la um are folks to maybe think about too so just tons of opportunity but thank you for your question thanks for your work can i call matt uh sure this is sarah palpatine um to the question about internet and no monies and whatnot of course all the freebie stuff has been covered i'd like to plug in for um exploring computer science i facilitated um a uh i guess the beginning of computer science and i began with um exploring computer science scratch and also code.org but exploring computer science you can do that without computers believe it or not being in a lecture hall it's really um native friendly my one of my favorite parts about that one is um the part where they talk about um there's a lesson plan for problem solving and we go through the pro the the kids have heard that millions of times right problem solving steps but it's very applicable to natives because i can um equate that to our navajo way of living and learning um the four directions and so that and the kids are like oh oh okay so the exploring computer science is really one year i did most of that curriculum without computers and i think that one was very um helpful to me because i i'm not a i'm not a programmer uh they for some reason they gravitated toward me just because i'm a good facilitator i guess and so but now um our school finally hired a mass computer programmer um a teacher so now that got off my hands um but exploring computer science would be awesome at the bie school and and i'll i'll throw out just as a bench because i work in academia i'm i'm working with two projects that are south dakota based so just south of you penny and just as a as a quick mention for anybody looking for partnerships look up who's doing the work and just reach out we're we're interested in making the world better and if it's not something we can do we probably know somebody who is in that space or interested in working in that space and it all just kind of starts from an email um i met frida sitting at a lunch counter one time at a conference and you know it's you have to build those connections and reach out and say hey what's up um and a lot of great stuff happens out of that there's another really cool free one we use which is called hello ruby and it's beautiful for younger kids and it's all offline all worksheets that help young people decide like drawing the internet and stuff like that i know we're out of time but hello ruby i thoroughly recommend everybody developed by a finnish woman i think right yeah yeah i think i saw her keynote really impressive she's really cool yeah also just uh sorry i know we're running a bit on time but a quick plug for mit app inventor it's perfect for kids who don't have any experience it's geared towards a little bit of a younger audience but it's kind of a drag and drop coding system where they can create their own apps and you can actually pull it up on your phone you kind of scan the barcode so that is just a really cool easy to use platform and there are full tutorials for projects so kids can kind of go through them on their own they don't need someone to facilitate okay thank you all for sharing we are overtime great conversation um and thank you everyone for the great questions and for participating thank you to the panelists for for sharing your work and your thoughts um yes sing stuff in chat could use another hour um there are other events going on i believe tomorrow um and the natives and tech conference is also happening uh i believe starting this evening over the weekend so again reach out please and figure out what what we can do thank you all thanks ian thanks everyone all right great talking to you guys today
