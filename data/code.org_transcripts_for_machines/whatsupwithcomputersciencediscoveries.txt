computer science has disrupted entire industries it's changed the way we think it's changed the way we communicate it's changed the way we work and it has the opportunity to change the way we teach students and having even a little bit of grounding in computer science can help you think about the world differently and getting past that initial fear of what computer science is is what's going to change the whole field of computer science computer science discoveries is a yearlong computer science course that covers hardware and how computers work it covers some web development how do websites get made how do they get published you get to do some programming with video games we talk about socially impactful areas of computer science well it's fun because a lot of time you get to collaborate with other people and you also get to get some insight on other people's ideas you can like do a lot of creativity stuff so if you're a creative person you might like it too and it always helps you with your life no matter what you're doing computer science is always there it's about the meaning of the work like changes that you actually want to see in the world or fun that you want to have or beauty that you want to experience through the the act of making something simple um you're learning all these lessons that you're going to be able to use to make really anything that you want there are a lot of challenges along the way but it's pretty satisfying in the end we get to just stand back and look at what you've done we've developed a lot of supports to help new teachers get into computer science our online learning platform code studio our lesson plans our videos and our forums where teachers can go to help support each other not only do i have an organization that supports me but i also have a whole community that i can lean on if i need something teachers start this course with a fiveday intensive kickoff and then as they begin to teach it there are more followup workshops throughout the school year teachers have an opportunity to experience the lesson and network with each other it just has a real powerful feeling of being connected and really involved with someone else's who's doing exactly what you're doing and choosing to be a part of this is a big deal it really helps it's just like a skill to have like instead of saying i don't know how to do it you can say i do know how to do
