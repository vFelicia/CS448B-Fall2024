one thing that computers are really good at is repeating commands as a person you get really bored if you had to do the same thing lots of times in a row but a computer can do the same thing millions or even billions of times and not get bored and be able to carry that out really well so for example if I wanted to wish everyone on facebook a happy birthday by sending them an email it might take me more than a century to actually write out all of those emails to everyone but with just a few lines of code i can have a system send an email to everyone on facebook wishing them a happy birthday so that's what loops are and why they're valuable and something that computers can do very well in this example your goal is going to be to move the bird now we're going to be able to use the repeat block in order to be able to do this very easily you can either do this by giving the computer and move forward command five times in order to advance the the bird one step each time to the pig or you can just tell the computer to move forward once and then tell it to repeat that five times and it will do the same thing so in order to do this you drag your move forward command and then you put it inside the repeat block and you can click on it and tell it how many times you want to repeat the block to tell how many steps you wanted to take forward now one more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside the repeat block so in this example your tongue it to move forward and turn left which will do five times alright good job and have fun
