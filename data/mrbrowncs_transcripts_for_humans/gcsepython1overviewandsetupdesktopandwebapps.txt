00:00 - hello and welcome to first in a series
00:02 - of videos which cover various features
00:04 - of the Python programming language now
00:07 - roads are really good resources online
00:08 - and more specifically on YouTube which
00:11 - cover Python I'm definitely not the
00:12 - first to approach this and you can learn
00:15 - Python so many different ways just using
00:17 - videos may not suit everyone but this
00:19 - series is designed especially for people
00:21 - studying computer science in UK schools
00:24 - including those doing qualifications
00:26 - like GCC's and a-levels because python
00:30 - is well - and doesn't belong to anyone
00:33 - in exam board the videos will be quite
00:35 - generic I'm not going to be tying from
00:37 - 20 particular exam board but I'll be
00:40 - emphasizing as we go through various
00:41 - concepts which are particularly relevant
00:43 - in UK curricula and likewise leaving out
00:46 - various constructs which aren't going to
00:49 - be required for most exams or
00:52 - assessments if you are wanting to learn
00:54 - or revise programming for a specific
00:56 - qualification especially if you have a
00:58 - written exam coming up have a look at
01:00 - other playlists on my channel where
01:02 - there will be videos which cover the
01:03 - more faretta core programming concepts
01:05 - although many will be showing
01:07 - practically here for now though I just
01:09 - want to give a brief overview of Python
01:11 - itself and show you how to get set up
01:13 - with Python both installing it on your
01:15 - computer and also accessing online and
01:17 - then get you to write your first line of
01:19 - code as well okay so really quickly what
01:22 - is Python so python is what we would
01:24 - consider a high-level and a very
01:26 - versatile programming language a
01:28 - programming language means we're using
01:30 - it to interact with a computer and get a
01:32 - computer to do what we instruct it to
01:34 - essentially which is very exciting it's
01:36 - high level so high level is a concept or
01:39 - the levels of programming languages is a
01:40 - concept in computer science so a high
01:42 - level language does not mean that it's
01:45 - like especially difficult that's what I
01:48 - perceived high level to me when I was
01:49 - learning my level means 4 there is a lot
01:51 - more readable it's a lot closer to
01:53 - English language than say the computers
01:56 - language which is in binary so you could
01:58 - program a computer in just binary
02:00 - because that's ultimately what a
02:02 - computer understands that's gonna be
02:04 - very difficult and so doing in a high
02:05 - level way means we can do it in pretty
02:07 - much human language just following a
02:11 - very strict
02:12 - the rules and so the high level
02:15 - languages is a massive category but even
02:16 - among them compared to other programming
02:19 - languages you might want to learn Python
02:20 - is especially high level which is really
02:23 - good for beginners because it looks
02:25 - especially like normal written English
02:29 - even if a slightly weird version so the
02:31 - top here this top line is from C or C++
02:34 - and this bottom line is from Python or
02:37 - dubis Python code a bit later printing
02:39 - hello world they're the same code they
02:41 - do the same thing both outputting hello
02:43 - world to the screen you can see
02:45 - immediately in C it's a little bit
02:47 - strange looking you've got some more
02:48 - elements to it or a semicolon Python is
02:51 - a little bit cleaner and it's a little
02:53 - bit more readable and it's one of the
02:54 - reasons why it's very versatile it can
02:55 - be used in lots different contexts so
02:58 - can see to be fair but python is often
03:01 - used as sort of a glue between various
03:02 - different purposes
03:04 - YouTube for a while use Python to work
03:08 - using lots of different applications you
03:10 - can do pretty much what you want to of
03:12 - Python
03:12 - maybe not for core aspects of Python but
03:15 - you can use what we call libraries to
03:17 - expand what Python can do and linked to
03:19 - various different applications it's also
03:22 - versatile because within Python you can
03:24 - effectively choose what style you want
03:27 - to follow
03:27 - we call them paradigms in computing so
03:30 - different paradigms for programming
03:31 - languages allow you to code in different
03:34 - ways and Python supports the main
03:36 - programming paradigms like functional
03:39 - programming like object-oriented
03:40 - programming and like structured
03:42 - programming which is what we're going to
03:43 - start with according to the later study
03:45 - I found Python is Karin Eva third most
03:47 - popular programming language in the
03:49 - world behind C is number two which is
03:52 - the code up here and number one is Java
03:54 - which you may have heard of both of
03:56 - those to a slightly lower level than
03:58 - Python although still considered high
03:59 - level languages but Python is really
04:02 - really popular especially celina if you
04:04 - ever go to university to do computer
04:06 - science it's very likely you will learn
04:07 - to see java and python good languages to
04:10 - use I personally like Python first and
04:12 - then that Java and C afterwards Python
04:15 - is a good springboard but partners use a
04:17 - lot and it's like hypothesis on my
04:19 - behalf but I would suggest for every big
04:20 - technology company we use Python code
04:23 - somewhere in their company even if it's
04:24 - not creating their main
04:26 - they'll be using Python code somewhere
04:28 - maybe it's running a website maybe it's
04:30 - linking a database maybe it's running
04:32 - some artificial intelligence algorithm
04:34 - python is used a lot but also as we go
04:37 - through these videos it may not be
04:38 - immediately clear how on earth what
04:40 - you're learning would ever be applied I
04:42 - certainly remember learning Python or
04:43 - thinking this is all fine but how is
04:46 - risk I'd ever be used and it it becomes
04:50 - a lot more linked to rule life problems
04:52 - once you start to use for as libraries I
04:54 - mentioned which tie your code to a
04:56 - particular purpose when we're learning
04:58 - for general constructs which are
04:59 - required to leave a more interesting
05:01 - stuff is can seem very detached from
05:04 - real life problems we need to learn for
05:06 - basics before we can do the more
05:07 - advanced stuff perfect itself has been
05:09 - around for a while released back in 1981
05:11 - by a man called guido van rossum
05:14 - a dutch programmer there are some good
05:16 - interviews of him on YouTube if you're
05:17 - interested and the name itself doesn't
05:20 - actually come from a snake even if the
05:22 - logo apparently is meant to be of two
05:24 - snakes blue snake and the yellow snake I
05:26 - didn't realize that for years her name
05:28 - comes from Monty Python which was or
05:30 - suppose is was a British comedy group
05:33 - back in the 70s in particular pretty
05:35 - famous and he was obviously inspired by
05:37 - them and named the language after them
05:39 - but you I mention this mostly because
05:41 - there are quite a few references to
05:43 - Monty Python has Erlang
05:44 - - and it'd be very confusing if you
05:46 - didn't know why they have those
05:50 - references even if you don't get four
05:51 - references yourself there'll be one
05:53 - later involving this man on the right -
05:55 - Eric Idle in terms of getting set up so
05:58 - we can start doing some coding a code is
06:00 - just an instruction to a computer a
06:02 - computer can't understand or code on its
06:05 - own because it's high level it's too
06:07 - high for a computer to understand we
06:09 - have to bring back down to a computer
06:11 - can understand which is binary
06:12 - thankfully we don't do both translation
06:14 - is done by a program called an
06:15 - interpreter but winged to have access TV
06:17 - interpreter to be able to run to be able
06:20 - to carry out Python code so there are
06:23 - too many ways of doing this both of
06:24 - which I'll show you briefly in a second
06:26 - the first way is downloading into your
06:27 - desktop which is good if you want to
06:30 - keep it offline and save your files and
06:33 - organize it that way but was also you
06:34 - can access it online via a web app okay
06:37 - I'll show you an example of that later
06:39 - as well perhaps visas worth getting - is
06:41 - just by googling install Python and
06:43 - you're looking for the downloads page of
06:45 - python.org who run the Python and so at
06:50 - the top I'm I think it may also detect
06:52 - your OS your operating systems or
06:55 - Windows or Mac or Linux if it doesn't
06:57 - you click for one which you are so I'm
06:59 - Windows so I wanna download the latest
07:01 - version there are previous versions down
07:04 - here I would stick to the latest one
07:06 - there's no reason not to really click
07:08 - download if you are prompted to save it
07:10 - and work for its downloading Chrome it's
07:12 - down at the bottom and now you can click
07:14 - it so it is at least a Windows ad or
07:16 - executable file Exe file and so you just
07:20 - click it now run and you can pretty much
07:22 - leave all the defaults how they are
07:23 - there's no particular reason why you
07:25 - wouldn't want to so you can install now
07:28 - for maybe a administrator request just
07:32 - sign in or press yes event or install
07:35 - like that okay and now once it's done it
07:38 - took me about a minute and a half to
07:40 - install and close it down once you have
07:42 - Python installed and you've closed
07:44 - Installer you now can search for idle or
07:46 - IDL e this is the name of the IDE the
07:51 - integrated development environment which
07:52 - we can write Python code in is called
07:54 - idle not IDE because one of the members
07:57 - of Monty Python is called Eric Idle so
07:59 - it's another reference to Monty Python
08:01 - but it is an integrated development
08:03 - environment so I've got the two minnows
08:05 - up here but this window pops up when you
08:07 - open idle is called for Python shell
08:09 - also called the interactive shell this
08:12 - is where we can type code line by line
08:13 - it's really good for testing things out
08:15 - and so the first few videos will be just
08:18 - in the shell and the first few to type
08:20 - in when you do any programming is always
08:22 - get the computer to say hello world so
08:26 - if you copy this bit of code print
08:29 - bracket quotes hello world close quote
08:33 - close bracket and then press Enter so
08:36 - for return key or Enter key on your
08:37 - keyboard you'll get four computer to
08:40 - speak to you so hello world is the
08:42 - output from the input up here this line
08:45 - of code for computer is running is
08:47 - processing is carrying out this
08:49 - instruction to print hello world as
08:51 - printing it to us and printing being
08:53 - another word for out putting it on the
08:54 - screen you can't really make a proper
08:56 - program in interactive mode effect you
08:59 - can't you can't save it or anything like
09:00 - that it's just for testing really and
09:02 - also running programs instead in Python
09:04 - need to go to script mode so script mode
09:06 - you access but that's a file a new file
09:09 - like that and a new window pops up and
09:12 - you can type the equivalent here the
09:13 - same code prints hello world like that
09:17 - and now this time instead of pressing
09:19 - enter pressing enter will just go down
09:21 - because it's where we'd write a proper
09:23 - long program so instead to run this code
09:25 - we go to run at the top and go to a run
09:27 - module or press f5 you've got to save
09:30 - your code this time which is good
09:31 - because we can keep it you press ok and
09:33 - choose a place on your computer to save
09:35 - it - files are called something dot py
09:38 - so I can just do I've done loads at once
09:41 - here example and press ENTER like that
09:44 - and it goes back to the shell because
09:47 - that's where the code is run so instead
09:49 - of having it as your code in the shell
09:51 - it just shows us the output in the show
09:53 - let me do that instead of actually
09:55 - downloading python and installing it on
09:56 - your computer on the desktop you can
09:58 - access it online via a web application
10:01 - an example is replic repl die T and this
10:06 - is free our time recording even if it
10:08 - does have a paid version as well so I'm
10:11 - going through my first few videos at
10:12 - least be using this it has the same
10:13 - features as idle in fact some more
10:16 - useful features as well which I'll show
10:18 - you in a second so once you go to our
10:19 - EPO to IT in your browser you can either
10:23 - to start coding straight to ever
10:24 - clicking this I mean going to - like
10:27 - this and then you will create a repple
10:30 - which is very sort of equipment of
10:32 - opening idle and here you can just get
10:34 - started very quickly it will give you
10:36 - here we've got on the one side is what
10:39 - the equivalent of your idle show is
10:40 - somewhere on side we've got the
10:42 - interactive shell we can type here so
10:44 - again if you haven't done in idle make
10:46 - sure at some point you type print hello
10:48 - world it's convention millions of
10:50 - programmers have done it before
10:51 - presenter and it runs it like the idle
10:54 - shell word on the left hand side is
10:56 - reckless equivalent of script mode so
10:58 - instead I can now here type in again
11:01 - hello world so was it struggle to type
11:04 - it when you try to talk so I've got my
11:07 - code ear and now as opposed to saving it
11:09 - thankfully it saves it for us which is
11:11 - quite nice
11:11 - I can hit run here and it runs it in my
11:15 - interactive shell over here like it did
11:18 - in idle so very very similar but this is
11:21 - good because you can do it without
11:23 - installing anything and I'd really
11:26 - recommend you sign up as well so you can
11:28 - sign up here again I can set up a time
11:29 - recording it's free at least initially
11:31 - and say you put username your email and
11:33 - a password sign up once you are signed
11:35 - in and have a new workspace
11:38 - what's good about doing online is you
11:39 - can share your code quite easily so
11:41 - there's a share button over here to
11:42 - click this you can share a link to your
11:45 - work space so if you have code which you
11:48 - want to show up say a teacher or a
11:49 - friend you just put the link into
11:51 - browser or show them the code you can
11:53 - also just share the output if you want
11:55 - to over here so it's quite good at
11:56 - sharing codes and also it can save that
11:58 - and keep it for you without having to
12:00 - manage on your computer so opposed to
12:03 - now I prefer to offline but doing online
12:04 - is really good especially once you're
12:06 - starting up feel free to use return tip
12:08 - software to idle or repla if you want to
12:11 - unfortunately kind of learn a
12:12 - programming language just by sitting
12:14 - watching a video it's really important
12:15 - you actually try for stuff yourself so
12:18 - the end of every video I'm going to
12:19 - include a try now which is exercise on
12:21 - multiple exercises which will hopefully
12:23 - reinforce for content of a video for
12:25 - this video is very simple just have
12:26 - access to Python setup somehow either
12:29 - desktop or online and make sure you have
12:31 - copied this code print hello world and I
12:34 - can see hello world coming back on your
12:36 - screen

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to first in a series of videos which cover various features of the Python programming language now roads are really good resources online and more specifically on YouTube which cover Python I'm definitely not the first to approach this and you can learn Python so many different ways just using videos may not suit everyone but this series is designed especially for people studying computer science in UK schools including those doing qualifications like GCC's and alevels because python is well and doesn't belong to anyone in exam board the videos will be quite generic I'm not

idle and here you can just get started very quickly it will give you here we've got on the one side is what the equivalent of your idle show is somewhere on side we've got the interactive shell we can type here so again if you haven't done in idle make sure at some point you type print hello world it's convention millions of programmers have done it before presenter and it runs it like the idle shell word on the left hand side is reckless equivalent of script mode so instead I can now here type in again hello world so was it struggle to type it when you try to talk so I've got my code ear and now as opposed to saving it thankfully it saves it for us which is quite nice I can hit run here and it runs it in my interactive shell over here like it did in idle so very very similar but this is good because you can do it without installing anything and I'd really recommend you sign up as well so you can sign up here again I can set up a time recording it's free at least initially and say you put username your email and a password sign up once you are signed in and have a new workspace what's good about doing online is you can share your code quite easily so there's a share button over here to click this you can share a link to your work space so if you have code which you want to show up say a teacher or a friend you just put the link into browser or show them the code you can also just share the output if you want to over here so it's quite good at sharing codes and also it can save that and keep it for you without having to manage on your computer so opposed to now I prefer to offline but doing online is really good especially once you're starting up feel free to use return tip software to idle or repla if you want to unfortunately kind of learn a programming language just by sitting watching a video it's really important you actually try for stuff yourself so the end of every video I'm going to include a try now which is exercise on multiple exercises which will hopefully reinforce for content of a video for this video is very simple just have access to Python setup somehow either desktop or online and make sure you have copied this code print hello world and I can see hello world coming back on your screen
