00:00 - in this video we'll go over how to write
00:01 - a java program in a simple text editor
00:04 - like notepad and compile and execute it
00:06 - directly from the command line maybe
00:08 - you're just starting out in java and you
00:09 - want to know how you can run your
00:10 - programs from the command line or maybe
00:12 - you've been programming in java for a
00:13 - while but you've only run your programs
00:16 - in an ide like eclipse either way i've
00:18 - got you covered my name is john i'm a
00:20 - lead java software engineer and i love
00:21 - sharing what i've learned with you in a
00:23 - clear and understandable way i also have
00:24 - a full java course available in a link
00:26 - down in the description if you're
00:27 - interested let's get right to it okay
00:29 - first there's only one thing you have to
00:31 - have installed to get this to work
00:33 - properly and that is the jdk the java
00:36 - development kit if you've already got it
00:38 - installed awesome if not just follow a
00:40 - link down in the description to go and
00:42 - download it run the installer it should
00:44 - just take a couple of minutes and you'll
00:45 - be good to go let's get started by
00:47 - opening the command prompt window to do
00:48 - that just go to the start menu type in
00:51 - cmd and press enter i'm doing this in
00:54 - windows 11 so if you're doing this in
00:55 - windows 10 or any other version of
00:57 - windows it might look a little bit
00:58 - different but it should still work the
00:59 - same way first let's just make sure that
01:01 - the jdk is correctly installed so we
01:03 - know we'll be able to run our java
01:05 - programs properly to do that you can
01:06 - just type in java space dash
01:10 - version and hit enter if you see
01:13 - something like this print out that shows
01:15 - the current version of java that you
01:16 - have installed you're good to go if you
01:18 - see some kind of error like java is not
01:20 - recognized as a command that means you
01:22 - don't have the jdk installed so go and
01:25 - do that in the link down in the
01:26 - description first next we just want to
01:28 - go to whatever folder on your computer
01:30 - that you want to use to put your java
01:32 - program for me i'm just going to put it
01:34 - on the desktop here so i've just
01:35 - navigated to my desktop folder next
01:38 - let's create the file for our java
01:40 - program to do that just right-click
01:42 - anywhere here in the folder and go to
01:44 - new and text document then just type in
01:47 - whatever you want to call your java
01:48 - program i'm going to call mine hey there
01:51 - earth everybody always calls there's
01:53 - hello world so let's just change it up a
01:55 - bit then hit enter to create it but this
01:57 - just creates a dot txt file not a dot
02:00 - java file and we need to create a java
02:03 - file to run our program properly so to
02:05 - change this to a java file you need to
02:07 - go up to the menu where it says view and
02:09 - then go to show and click file name
02:12 - extensions again i'm using windows 11 so
02:14 - this is what it looks like for windows
02:16 - 10 it's very similar just go to the view
02:18 - tab at the top and click the check box
02:20 - for file name extensions in the show
02:22 - hide section so now we can see it has
02:24 - the txt file extension to change that to
02:28 - java just right click and go to rename
02:31 - or you can also just hit the f2 key to
02:33 - rename and change the file extension
02:35 - from txt to dot java and hit enter
02:38 - you'll probably get a warning about
02:39 - changing the file name just go ahead and
02:41 - click yes next we want to open this file
02:43 - so we can write our program in it in
02:45 - notepad so just right click the file and
02:47 - go to open with and if you don't see
02:49 - notepad in this list like i don't have
02:51 - notepad just go to choose another app
02:53 - and then here you might have to click
02:55 - more apps to show more applications and
02:57 - then notepad should show there so just
02:58 - select notepad and click ok that'll open
03:01 - your hey there earth program right here
03:03 - in notepad this is where you'll put
03:04 - whatever code you want for your java
03:06 - program we'll keep this one very simple
03:08 - class hey there earth create our public
03:11 - static void main method strain args
03:14 - we'll just have it print out hey there
03:16 - earth close the method and close the
03:18 - class to save the file just go to file
03:21 - and save or just hit control s
03:24 - next let's go back to the command line
03:26 - and navigate to the directory where we
03:28 - made our java program so for me since i
03:30 - put it on the desktop i just need to
03:31 - type in cd desktop to change my
03:34 - directory to the desktop and if i want
03:36 - to make sure i'm in the right directory
03:37 - i can just type in dir and here i can
03:40 - see my heytherearth.java program ready
03:43 - to go so now what do we enter to run our
03:46 - java program well actually before we can
03:48 - run it we have to compile it into
03:50 - something that the computer can
03:52 - understand and run called bytecode to
03:54 - compile it we'll use the java c command
03:57 - java c for the java compiler makes sense
04:00 - right so just type in java c and then
04:02 - the name of the file that you want to
04:04 - compile so for me it's hey there
04:06 - earth.java make sure you put the java
04:09 - file extension in there or you'll
04:10 - probably get some kind of error so just
04:12 - enter that and then press enter if you
04:14 - don't see any output at all you don't
04:16 - see any errors or anything that means
04:18 - that it worked and to verify that you
04:20 - can go back out into your folder and see
04:22 - that it created a dot class file for
04:25 - your program so here it's
04:26 - heythereearth.com
04:28 - this is the bytecode file that i was
04:30 - talking about so now your program is in
04:32 - a form that you can execute directly if
04:34 - you have some kind of error in your
04:35 - program like let's say you didn't end
04:38 - your quote or something when you go to
04:39 - try and compile your program hey there
04:42 - earth.java you'll get a printout showing
04:44 - where it's running into the compilation
04:46 - error if you get something like that
04:47 - just go into your file and fix it save
04:49 - it and run the compiler again so like i
04:52 - said now our program is in bytecode form
04:54 - that we can run so what's the command to
04:56 - actually run it just use the java
04:58 - command not java c just java and then
05:01 - the name of your program so hey there
05:04 - earth for this command you don't need to
05:06 - type out the dot java file extension and
05:08 - then press enter so it printed out hey
05:10 - there earth and that's what our program
05:12 - was supposed to do so it ran
05:14 - successfully so doing it from the
05:15 - command line is a little bit more work
05:17 - than just clicking the run button in
05:19 - your ide but it's not really too hard it
05:21 - just takes a couple of commands and it's
05:23 - just something that every java
05:24 - programmer should know you should know
05:25 - how to run simple java programs from the
05:28 - command line like this if you enjoyed
