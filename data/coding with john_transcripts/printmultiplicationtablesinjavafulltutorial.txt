00:01 - hey guys john here in this video we're
00:02 - going to go over how to print out
00:04 - multiplication tables in
00:05 - java so given some number we're going to
00:07 - print out all the multiples of it up to
00:09 - some
00:09 - limit so say if we start with the number
00:11 - seven we'll print out seven times zero
00:13 - seven times one seven times two up to
00:15 - whatever limit we set
00:17 - now before we get started here the full
00:18 - source code is available in a link down
00:20 - in the description so go
00:22 - grab it it's going to be a simple piece
00:24 - of code i think we're going to use a for
00:25 - loop to do it
00:26 - and at the end i'm also going to show
00:27 - you how you can get that initial number
00:30 - as input from the user via the keyboard
00:33 - so let's get to it so first we're going
00:35 - to need a number that we're going to
00:36 - print out the multiples
00:38 - of so let's just create that as a
00:40 - variable we're going to use an
00:41 - int we're going to call our number
00:43 - variable
00:44 - number so int number equals um let's
00:47 - just print out the multiples of seven
00:49 - to begin with so let's say we want to
00:51 - print out all the multiples of seven
00:53 - seven times zero
00:54 - seven times one sometimes two all the
00:55 - way up to seven times ten so we want to
00:57 - go from
00:58 - 0 to 10 multiplying all of those by 7
01:01 - and print out the results
01:02 - now the easiest way to do that is
01:03 - probably with a for loop so we're going
01:05 - to create a for loop
01:06 - starting with int i equals 0
01:10 - starting with zero and then we want to
01:12 - go while
01:13 - i is less than or equal to
01:16 - n so we're going to start with zero and
01:18 - end at ten if we just had i
01:19 - less than ten it would stop at nine i'm
01:22 - going to do i
01:23 - plus plus so we increment i each time so
01:26 - inside of this
01:27 - we're just going to print out the result
01:29 - of that multiplication so like
01:30 - seven times zero equals whatever the
01:33 - result is
01:34 - so let's just print that out where it's
01:35 - going to be a system.out.printline
01:40 - so first we want to print uh the number
01:42 - that we want to do the multiple of
01:43 - so just number and then we want to say
01:46 - number times whatever the current value
01:49 - of i
01:49 - is so here it'll be number times
01:53 - and then the next thing whatever the
01:54 - value of i is is in i
01:57 - so in the first run of this loop it's
01:58 - going to say 7
02:00 - times 0 because 7 is our number that's
02:03 - not going to change
02:04 - and i in the first run of the loop is
02:05 - going to be 0. and then we're going to
02:07 - print out
02:08 - uh equals so seven times
02:11 - zero equals and now we want to print out
02:14 - the actual
02:15 - result of that multiplication of seven
02:18 - times i and to do that it's kind of as
02:20 - simple as it seems you can just
02:22 - literally print out number times
02:26 - i we put that in parentheses so there's
02:28 - no chance of any wonkiness of it doing
02:30 - some other order of operations that we
02:32 - don't expect it's going to calculate
02:34 - number times i and that's what it's
02:35 - going to print out in that spot
02:37 - so for the first round of this loop we
02:38 - expect seven times zero
02:40 - equals zero and then for the second run
02:43 - seven times
02:43 - one equals one and so on and then the
02:46 - last thing we should see is seven times
02:48 - ten
02:48 - equals 70 and we should see everything
02:50 - in between
02:52 - so let's go ahead and run it and see
02:53 - what happens
02:55 - so yeah all right we've got seven times
02:58 - zero equals zero seven times one equals
02:59 - seven
03:00 - all the way down to seven times ten
03:02 - equals seventy awesome we're putting
03:04 - out multiplication tables not so hard
03:05 - right of course we can mess around with
03:07 - this however we want instead of just
03:08 - going from zero to ten we can go
03:10 - from zero to ten thousand let's just run
03:13 - that see what happens
03:14 - and of course that works too um i'm not
03:16 - going to go in and check all 10
03:18 - 000 of these operations to make sure
03:19 - that's doing the math right i trust java
03:21 - to do a fine job with that
03:22 - and of course we're all we can also just
03:24 - change the number that we're writing the
03:25 - multiplication tables for so let's go
03:27 - ahead and change this back to 10 real
03:29 - quick
03:29 - and change this to just do um and change
03:32 - this to do something else i don't know
03:33 - multiples of um
03:34 - 12. so let's go ahead and print that out
03:37 - awesome
03:38 - 12 times 0 0 all the way up to 12 times
03:40 - 10 equals 120
03:41 - perfect so i'll go ahead and make this
03:42 - code a little bit more robust so
03:44 - you can hard code this number but i
03:46 - think it's a little cool to be able to
03:48 - just take that number
03:49 - from the user so you ask the user hey
03:51 - what number do you want to print out a
03:52 - multiplication table for
03:53 - and then that's the number that you
03:54 - print out all these results for and so
03:56 - to be able to get
03:57 - input from the user we use the scanner
04:00 - class in java so i'm going to create a
04:02 - new scanner
04:03 - called scanner so scanner scanner equals
04:07 - new scanner and to get keyboard input
04:09 - from the user we use
04:11 - system dot in here as the parameter to
04:13 - create our scanner
04:15 - and since we're using eclipse we can
04:16 - automatically import
04:18 - uh java.util.scanner if you aren't using
04:20 - a fancy ide like this just this is the
04:22 - import you need for that
04:24 - java.util.scanner and then to get the
04:26 - input from the user first we want to
04:28 - print out a little message to them to
04:29 - prompt them hey we would like you to
04:31 - input something
04:32 - so that's just system.out.printline
04:35 - i don't know it could be something
04:36 - simple just like enter a number
04:39 - and this prompts them to guess what
04:41 - enter a number and then instead of
04:42 - assigning this int number to be
04:44 - something hard
04:44 - coded we can then get this as input from
04:47 - the user
04:48 - and to do that we use the scanner object
04:50 - that we created and we call a method on
04:52 - it called
04:53 - next int and calling this method allows
04:56 - the user to insert a number via the
04:57 - keyboard in the console
04:59 - let's go ahead and give that a run see
05:01 - how it happens
05:02 - so it's prompting me enter a number and
05:04 - let's do what we did at first
05:05 - seven and awesome it's taking that seven
05:08 - and printing out the multiplication
05:09 - tables for it
05:10 - sweet uh just for fun let's try another
05:13 - number uh i don't know um
05:14 - something ridiculous and again i trust
05:18 - java to get those calculations right but
05:20 - it looks like it's working great you
05:22 - could spot check a couple of them of
05:23 - course uh
05:24 - 586 156 times 10
05:27 - is this with an extra zero at the end
05:30 - and then 586 156 times zero equals zero
05:33 - times one is itself
05:35 - great seems to be working like a dream
05:37 - so one thing to note here if you give it
05:39 - a run and
05:40 - it tells you to enter a number and you
05:41 - enter something that's totally not a
05:43 - number and java can't make a number out
05:45 - of
05:46 - you're going to see that it gives you an
05:47 - input mismatch
05:49 - exception it's trying to create a number
05:51 - from something you give it that isn't a
05:53 - number and it's not going to work so if
05:54 - you'd like to see a full tutorial about
05:56 - how to handle those kinds of exceptions
05:57 - when you're getting input from the user
05:59 - check out this other video i made on
06:01 - getting keyboard input from the user via
06:02 - the scanner class
06:04 - it goes through everything you need to
06:05 - know about how to handle those types of
06:06 - exceptions
06:07 - and then allows the user to enter
06:08 - another value until they enter something
06:10 - that java can deal with
06:12 - so that's it guys not so hard right
06:14 - pretty cool if you got some value from
06:15 - this video show me by giving it a like
06:17 - and you'd like to see
06:18 - more java tutorials like this in future
06:19 - go ahead and hit that subscribe button
06:21 - i think that's it thanks for watching
06:23 - i'll see you guys in the next video
06:25 - that way i forgot the more astute of you
06:27 - might have seen this yellow
06:29 - underline on the scanner and that's
06:31 - eclipse complaining to me that i
06:33 - didn't close my scanner probably it's
06:35 - not going to cause big problems in a
06:36 - small program like this but it is always
06:38 - good practice to
06:39 - be a good boy scout and close your
06:41 - scanners so to do that just call scanner
06:43 - dot close so then we've made eclipse
06:46 - happy we get that nice warm cozy fuzzy
06:48 - feeling about ourselves that we have
06:49 - nice clean coat and we close our
06:51 - scanners
06:52 - then we can feel good of ourselves we've
06:53 - done some good for the world you know
06:54 - it's like
06:55 - it's like feeding the homeless saving a
06:56 - puppy closing a scanner i think it's
06:58 - about the same
06:59 - all right that's it guys see you next
07:01 - time
