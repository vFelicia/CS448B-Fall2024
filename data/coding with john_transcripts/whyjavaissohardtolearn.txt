00:00 - have you been struggling to learn java
00:01 - and wondering why it's so much harder
00:02 - than you expected it to be in this video
00:04 - we're going to talk about a few things
00:05 - that can make
00:06 - java really difficult to learn my name
00:08 - is john i'm a lead java software
00:09 - engineer and i love sharing what i've
00:10 - learned in a clear and understandable
00:12 - way even if it is really hard so if
00:13 - you'd like to see more be sure to hit
00:14 - the subscribe button so you don't miss
00:15 - each new video i also have a full java
00:17 - course available and a link down in the
00:18 - description if you're interested
00:19 - the first thing about java that can make
00:21 - it so hard for a beginner is just a huge
00:23 - amount of basic code you have to put in
00:24 - to run anything at all so you've
00:26 - probably written a hello world program
00:27 - in java right that's everybody's first
00:28 - program if you're coming from another
00:30 - language like python all it takes in
00:31 - python to do hello world is just
00:33 - print hello world poof that's it now
00:35 - that program is easy for a beginner to
00:37 - understand but if you're trying to teach
00:38 - hello world in java to a beginner first
00:40 - you need
00:40 - public class hello world excuse me i
00:44 - just want to print something i don't
00:45 - think i need all of this extra junk yes
00:47 - you do you need it
00:48 - don't ask why just do it okay okay all
00:50 - right now can i put in my print
00:51 - statement no no there's more you still
00:52 - need
00:53 - okay next you need public static void
00:56 - main and then in parentheses you need
00:58 - string open and close bracket
01:00 - args but what why do i need all of that
01:03 - what does it even mean
01:04 - you just do you just need it don't ask
01:05 - why don't ask what it means right now
01:06 - it'll be too confusing
01:07 - uh okay now at least can i put my print
01:10 - statement yes now you can put in your
01:11 - print statement
01:12 - okay so i just do print no no no no you
01:13 - can't just do print it's
01:16 - system.out.printline
01:17 - and then you can put in hello world ah
01:19 - man finally that and don't forget the
01:21 - semicolon
01:22 - i think i'll just stick to python it's
01:24 - kind of like you're trying to teach this
01:25 - beginner to make a peanut butter
01:27 - sandwich but then you say well first you
01:28 - have to build an entire kitchen with all
01:30 - the cabinetry the pantry you have to do
01:32 - all the plumbing put in the countertops
01:33 - then finally you can get out the bread
01:35 - and the peanut butter and a knife and
01:36 - actually make your sandwich
01:37 - the second thing is just the
01:39 - overwhelming amount of things
01:41 - to learn when you first start learning
01:42 - you think okay variables
01:44 - all right int long string okay got it if
01:47 - this then that
01:48 - else if this then that okay and then you
01:50 - keep learning about more and more things
01:52 - that exist that you're eventually going
01:54 - to have to learn
01:54 - inheritance polymorphism collections
01:57 - like lists arraylists hashmaps tree maps
01:59 - linked lists vectors classes objects
02:01 - generics lambdas static and non-static
02:04 - jar files the jvm the jre and the jdk
02:06 - and all of that is just scratching
02:08 - the surface look there is a lot to learn
02:10 - about java don't try to learn everything
02:12 - at once and just watching a bunch of
02:14 - youtube videos about it won't help you
02:15 - if you never actually
02:16 - code anything but obviously you should
02:18 - still watch all of mine figure out
02:20 - something that you
02:21 - want to make just get started coding
02:23 - watch a few videos if you run into
02:24 - something you can't figure out along the
02:26 - way then
02:26 - get right back to coding take it step by
02:28 - step and accept that there will be a lot
02:30 - that you don't know just take your time
02:32 - you'll get to it the third thing that
02:33 - makes java so difficult is just all the
02:35 - object oriented stuff when you first
02:37 - start learning java you start with your
02:38 - basic programs like hello world or maybe
02:40 - something simple like a gpa calculator
02:42 - which actually was my very first youtube
02:44 - video so click here if you'd like to
02:45 - suffer through that but all those
02:46 - programs they were all in one class all
02:48 - in one file and probably mostly just
02:50 - inside that main method they were very
02:52 - simple
02:52 - life was good java made sense
02:55 - then start learning about this object
02:57 - oriented stuff classes
02:59 - objects inheritance encapsulation
03:01 - abstraction polymorphism static and
03:03 - non-static when i was taking my college
03:05 - course all the static versus non-static
03:07 - stuff was just something i just
03:09 - couldn't wrap my mind around static
03:11 - method can only be called from a static
03:13 - context what even is a static context
03:15 - object oriented programming is a whole
03:16 - different way to think about your
03:18 - programs than your basic
03:19 - procedural programming but like a lot of
03:21 - other things it just took a lot of time
03:22 - and practice until it all started
03:24 - sinking in
03:24 - the fourth thing that makes java so hard
03:26 - is it's not just java
03:28 - programming is hard programming is a
03:30 - unique kind of skill that most people
03:32 - never have to develop or use but
03:33 - programming is hard people dedicate
03:35 - their entire lives and careers to
03:37 - programming you won't take a week or a
03:39 - month long course or watch a bunch of
03:40 - youtube videos
03:41 - and then wake up the next day with a six
03:43 - figure programming job learning to
03:44 - program takes patience and honestly just
03:46 - the ability to
03:47 - sit in front of a computer and work on a
03:49 - single problem for
03:51 - hours and hours or days at a time if you
03:53 - run into a programming problem and find
03:54 - yourself hammering away at it till two
03:56 - three in the morning trying different
03:57 - things and googling like crazy forever
03:59 - with a thousand browser tabs open until
04:01 - you
04:01 - finally figure it out if you find
04:03 - yourself doing that i think you've got
04:04 - what it takes
04:05 - just keep at it but one thing that can
04:06 - make java a whole lot easier hit that
