00:00 - if you've never programmed in java
00:01 - before or even never programmed at
00:03 - all before and you want to create your
00:04 - very first java program and get it up
00:06 - and running
00:06 - this is the video for you you don't need
00:08 - any prior coding experience or java
00:10 - knowledge
00:10 - all you need is a computer this video is
00:13 - for the absolute
00:14 - java beginner starting from scratch who
00:16 - wants to get their very first java
00:17 - program
00:18 - up and running my name is john i'm a
00:20 - lead java software engineer and i love
00:21 - sharing what i've learned
00:22 - in a clear understandable way so if you
00:24 - like this video be sure to subscribe so
00:26 - you don't miss each new java tutorial i
00:28 - also have a full java course available
00:29 - in the link down in the description if
00:31 - you're interested okay so let's get
00:32 - started installing everything we're
00:34 - going to need
00:34 - to code and run our first java program
00:36 - the first thing we're going to need to
00:38 - install is called the jdk
00:40 - the java development kit the jdk gives
00:42 - us everything we're going to need
00:44 - to take the java source code that we're
00:45 - going to write and turn it into
00:47 - actual functional java programs and give
00:50 - us the ability to run them
00:51 - the link to download the jdk is down in
00:53 - the description currently at the time of
00:54 - this recording you can see we're at
00:56 - a jdk version number 16. but whenever
00:58 - you're watching this just go ahead and
00:59 - download whatever the most recent
01:01 - version is
01:01 - so if we scroll down on this page we can
01:03 - see all the different options we have
01:05 - for downloading it for me i'm using
01:06 - windows so i'm going to click the
01:08 - windows
01:09 - installer check the box and click the
01:11 - download button if you're using mac go
01:13 - ahead and click the mac installer
01:14 - whenever that's finished downloading go
01:15 - ahead and open it up and it'll walk you
01:16 - through a normal installation process
01:18 - just click next this will tell you where
01:19 - exactly it's going to install the jdk on
01:21 - your computer so it's good to just take
01:22 - note of that in case you need to know
01:23 - later you can just use the default
01:25 - location and click
01:26 - next now it's installing that completed
01:28 - successfully so we can go ahead and
01:29 - close that out
01:29 - the second thing we're going to want to
01:31 - install is called an ide
01:33 - an integrated development environment so
01:35 - you could if you really wanted you could
01:37 - write all of your java programs just in
01:38 - something like
01:39 - notepad and use like command line tools
01:41 - with the jdk that we just installed
01:43 - to build and run your java programs you
01:45 - can do that if you really want to but an
01:47 - ide just gives you a ton of tools that
01:49 - make
01:50 - developing your java code a whole lot
01:52 - easier one of the most popular ides
01:54 - and the ide that i like and use the most
01:56 - is called
01:57 - eclipse there's a link down in the
01:58 - description to download that as well
02:00 - it'll take you to this page here so just
02:01 - go ahead and click on the download
02:03 - button
02:03 - and then click the download button again
02:04 - here and it'll start downloading the
02:06 - eclipse ide is going to help us actually
02:08 - write our java programs and then the jdk
02:11 - that we installed is going to take the
02:12 - java programs that we write and turn
02:14 - them into a format the computer can
02:15 - understand and run them
02:16 - download's complete let's click it to
02:18 - run it this thing always looks like kind
02:19 - of a sideways gear face to me
02:21 - when you run the installer you're going
02:22 - to see this with a whole bunch of
02:23 - different options of what you can
02:24 - install
02:25 - all you need is the very first one the
02:26 - eclipse ide for java developers don't
02:28 - worry about any of the other ones that's
02:30 - the one you want
02:30 - click that it should automatically find
02:32 - the location of the jdk that you've
02:34 - already installed so you can go ahead
02:35 - and click install
02:36 - completed successfully so let's click
02:38 - that launch button and get started with
02:39 - coding here it'll prompt you to select a
02:41 - directory to use for your workspace this
02:43 - is just a file location where eclipse
02:45 - will put all of your java source code i
02:46 - just use what it defaults to but you can
02:48 - put in whatever directory you like and
02:49 - click
02:50 - launch when it launches you'll see this
02:51 - welcome page that you can just close out
02:53 - when you get started using an ide like
02:55 - eclipse all the different options can
02:57 - feel overwhelming at first but for now
02:58 - you can just ignore most of it and just
03:00 - focus on the few simple things we have
03:01 - to do to create and run
03:03 - a java program in eclipse each program
03:05 - has to be inside a project so the first
03:07 - thing we need to do is just
03:08 - create a new java project since we don't
03:10 - currently have any projects you could
03:12 - click this create a java project here
03:14 - but once you create your first project
03:15 - this will go away so let's go ahead and
03:17 - create a java project
03:18 - the normal way go up to file and then
03:20 - new
03:21 - java project you can name it whatever
03:22 - you like let's just say first
03:24 - java project you can uncheck here where
03:27 - it says create
03:28 - moduleinfo.javafile we won't need that
03:30 - and then click
03:31 - finish so over here is where we can find
03:33 - the first java project that we created
03:35 - this package explorer tab is where
03:37 - you're going to find all of your
03:38 - projects
03:39 - and individual java program files that
03:41 - you create so what we can do is click
03:42 - this little caret to expand this project
03:44 - you'll see two folders inside this jre
03:47 - system library folder
03:48 - and the src folder your source folder
03:50 - the source folder is going to be the
03:52 - important one that's where we're going
03:53 - to put all the source code for our java
03:55 - program so to create our first java
03:56 - source code file in our project we're
03:58 - going to right click this source folder
04:00 - and then go to new and then class for
04:02 - now it's fine to think of a java class
04:04 - as just a fancy name for a java source
04:05 - code file you can give it whatever name
04:07 - you like we'll just call it
04:08 - first java program you're also going to
04:11 - want to check this box where it says
04:12 - public static void
04:14 - main string args we'll talk more about
04:16 - that in just a second for now go ahead
04:17 - and click
04:18 - finish and it'll create this first java
04:20 - program.java file let's go ahead and
04:22 - blow this up a bit so you can see it
04:23 - better let's talk a little bit about
04:25 - what it automatically put in this file
04:26 - at the very top here we see this public
04:28 - class first java program this is just
04:30 - called a class declaration and every
04:32 - java file will have it it just says here
04:34 - is a java file called
04:35 - first java program and then you see
04:37 - these curly braces here everything in
04:39 - this class is going to be enclosed
04:41 - between those curly braces next we have
04:43 - this public static void main
04:45 - string args thing there's a whole lot of
04:47 - complicated looking programming terms in
04:48 - it but all you need to know for now is
04:50 - that it's called
04:51 - the main method and inside this main
04:53 - methods curly braces
04:54 - is where you're going to put all the
04:55 - commands that you want to run for your
04:56 - program and if you're too curious about
04:58 - what all this stuff means i have another
04:59 - video here fully explaining
05:01 - this main method when it generates this
05:02 - file you'll see this uh to do
05:04 - auto-generated method stub this is
05:06 - what's called a comment it's
05:07 - automatically generated and we don't
05:08 - need it so we can just go ahead and
05:10 - remove it inside this main method is
05:12 - where we're going to put all the
05:13 - commands that we want our program to run
05:15 - when we tell it to run the program it'll
05:16 - run through all the commands in our main
05:18 - method and once it reaches the end of
05:20 - our main method
05:20 - the program will end the very first
05:22 - program everyone writes is just called
05:24 - hello world so we'll do that now just
05:25 - because it's kind of a rite of passage
05:27 - everybody has to do it but then we'll do
05:28 - something a little bit more interesting
05:29 - also so this will just have the program
05:31 - print out the words hello world here's
05:34 - the command to have java print out some
05:35 - text
05:35 - it's system with a capital s dot out
05:39 - dot print ln and then an open
05:43 - parentheses
05:44 - and inside these parentheses is where
05:46 - you're going to put whatever text you
05:47 - would like the program to print out and
05:49 - have to put that text in quote so here
05:51 - we'll have
05:51 - in quotes hello world then we have an
05:55 - end quote and a closed parenthesis
05:56 - and then a semicolon at the end of the
05:58 - line in java every single statement has
06:00 - to end with a semicolon after you've
06:02 - typed that out go over and click
06:03 - the save button to save your program and
06:06 - then click this green arrow which is the
06:07 - run button that will run your program so
06:09 - let's see what it does
06:10 - alright it printed out the words hello
06:12 - world congrats you coded and ran your
06:14 - very first java program
06:16 - a few things to note in eclipse whenever
06:18 - you print something out in your java
06:20 - programs it's going to show up in this
06:21 - little window here called the console
06:23 - you might hear this referred to as
06:25 - the console output another thing is that
06:27 - java is case sensitive so if you happen
06:28 - to mess some of this up and make
06:30 - something capital that shouldn't be
06:31 - you're going to get errors but a cool
06:33 - thing about using an ide like eclipse is
06:35 - that if you make a mistake and code
06:37 - something that doesn't make
06:38 - sense in the java language like say we
06:40 - just have a print n instead of print
06:42 - ln eclipse gives us this like red
06:44 - squiggly line kind of like if you
06:45 - misspell something in word so we know we
06:47 - have an error in our program and eclipse
06:49 - even gives us some suggestions on how to
06:51 - fix it so here it suggests oh we could
06:53 - change it to print
06:54 - ln and we can click it and it
06:55 - automatically fixes the code now that
06:57 - we've coded the hello world program
06:58 - let's do something a little bit more
06:59 - interesting
07:00 - and create two numbers and have java add
07:03 - them together and tell us the total so
07:04 - let's get rid of this hello world line
07:06 - now in programming when we want to
07:08 - create something like a number
07:10 - or a string of letters or text we use
07:12 - what's called a
07:13 - variable to hold that information and to
07:15 - create a variable we have to tell java a
07:17 - few things
07:18 - the first thing is we need to tell java
07:19 - what type of information
07:21 - we want to store in this variable and
07:23 - that's called the type for a standard
07:24 - number we can just use the
07:26 - int type which stands for integer this
07:28 - will hold any standard whole number just
07:30 - not decimals or fractions or things like
07:32 - that the next thing we need to tell java
07:33 - is a name for the variable
07:35 - it can be just about anything you want
07:36 - but it should reflect what is actually
07:39 - being stored in the variable so if we
07:40 - were using this in to store someone's
07:42 - age
07:43 - we should probably call it something
07:44 - like age but here since we're just
07:46 - adding two numbers together we can just
07:47 - call it
07:48 - uh num1 then we want to tell java what
07:50 - we want the initial
07:51 - value of this variable to be and this is
07:54 - called initializing a variable because
07:56 - we're giving it its initial value let's
07:57 - say we want to start num1 with a value
07:59 - of seven all we have to do is say
08:01 - int num1 equals seven this assigns the
08:04 - num1 variable
08:06 - the value of seven and then like every
08:07 - java statement we need to end it with
08:09 - a semicolon so next we wanna create our
08:11 - second number and we'll do it exactly
08:13 - the same way
08:13 - we want another int variable and we'll
08:15 - call it num2
08:16 - and we'll initialize it with the value
08:19 - of five
08:20 - semicolon to end the statement so now
08:21 - all we've done is declared and
08:23 - initialize our two numbers
08:25 - so we can actually do is create a new
08:27 - int variable we'll call it
08:28 - total and we want to initialize its
08:30 - value to be the sum
08:32 - of those other two numbers and to do
08:34 - that we can just say num1
08:36 - plus num2 and end of the semicolon this
08:38 - will take the values that are currently
08:40 - assigned to num1 and num2 which
08:42 - are 7 and 5 and add them together and
08:45 - store that result
08:46 - in this total variable so after this
08:48 - line in the program this total variable
08:51 - will have the value of 12. now we just
08:52 - need to print out the result we'll print
08:54 - out the same way we did before which is
08:56 - system.out.print
08:57 - ln so if we want to print out this total
08:59 - variable we'll just put in
09:01 - total end it with a semicolon that
09:03 - should be it let's go ahead and save and
09:05 - run it click
09:06 - run and perfect we get the result of 12.
09:09 - notice that we didn't want to use quotes
09:11 - here like we did before when we were
09:12 - printing hello world
09:13 - when you want to print the value of a
09:15 - variable you don't use quotes if you use
09:17 - quotes
09:17 - java assumes that you mean to print this
09:19 - actual text
09:20 - so if you do put quotes in there and you
09:22 - save it and run that java will just
09:24 - print out the word total
09:25 - probably not what you want all right
09:26 - awesome in just a few minutes completely
09:28 - from scratch
09:29 - you've been able to code and run your
09:31 - first java program successfully but of
09:33 - course there's just so much more in java
09:34 - to learn so to continue your java
09:36 - learning be sure to check out my other
09:37 - beginner java videos like creating a
09:39 - rock paper scissors game or a number
09:40 - guessing game those are cool fun
09:42 - projects that will keep you
09:43 - interested in having fun while learning
09:45 - java so keep coding and having fun thank
09:47 - you so much for watching and i'll see
09:48 - you in the next video
