00:00 - hey everybody in this video I'm going to
00:02 - be taking some time to respond to some
00:05 - questions and comments I've gotten over
00:07 - the past weeks and months in other
00:09 - YouTube comments although I do read each
00:12 - and every one of them I don't always
00:14 - have time to respond to all of them so I
00:16 - thought hey let's make a video of it and
00:18 - have some fun with it now before we get
00:19 - right into it I do have a full Java
00:21 - course available in a link down in the
00:23 - description there you'll find dozens of
00:25 - videos exclusive to the course packed
00:27 - with Java knowledge so go check it out
00:28 - first up is a very important set of
00:31 - comments of course I do get a lot of
00:33 - comments about being follicly challenged
00:36 - like here from Sanjay he says do you
00:39 - guys observe one thing senior developer
00:41 - YouTubers like John code with mosh
00:44 - Naveen Reddy from Telco don't have hair
00:47 - on their head I think they are hiding
00:49 - Dark Side of IT industry and also Rohit
00:52 - says in the process of learning to code
00:54 - you lose your hair senkai says when your
00:58 - hair starts to fall out you realize your
01:00 - or Java skills are improving luxia says
01:02 - looking forward to your hair sponsorship
01:04 - and also Andrew in my video about how
01:07 - Java strings are immutable he says your
01:10 - hairstyle is immutable Patrick Bateman
01:12 - says he gave up his hair for Java
01:14 - superpowers hashtag bald people have
01:17 - superpowers cyros says thanks gigachad
01:20 - bald man co-gaming hub says you good bro
01:24 - but why you bald not really sure what
01:27 - he'd like me to do about that edge Lamer
01:30 - says nice tutorial Mr bald head
01:32 - subscribed thank you so much now of
01:35 - course this goes on and on I get these
01:37 - kinds of comments all the time now now
01:39 - these commenters might have a point
01:40 - there does seem to be kind of a theme
01:42 - across some of these programming
01:44 - instructors on YouTube I think if I just
01:46 - got a little bit thicker glasses and
01:48 - maybe had a little bit more glowing of a
01:50 - smile I might look just like mosh and
01:54 - hey mosh makes amazing videos and has
01:56 - millions of subscribers I should be so
01:58 - lucky let's see
02:01 - got to get that that confident smile
02:04 - he doesn't even really shy away from it
02:05 - and all his thumbnails his head is like
02:07 - glowing another thing though that I've
02:09 - learned from all these comments is that
02:11 - if you're bald and wear glasses people
02:14 - will say that you look like basically
02:16 - anybody else in the world who is bald
02:19 - and wears glasses I've been compared to
02:21 - basically every bald guy with classes
02:23 - that I can possibly think of and many
02:25 - that I've never heard of yes I am bald
02:27 - no there's not much that can be done
02:29 - about that now with all these
02:31 - programming YouTubers that seem to be
02:33 - hair challenged you might conclude that
02:35 - there could be some kind of cause effect
02:37 - relationship between programming or even
02:40 - programming in Java in particular and
02:43 - losing one's hair slowly or extremely
02:45 - quickly over time now of course I'm not
02:48 - positive whether that's true or not but
02:50 - for a comparison here is a picture of me
02:53 - in my freshman year of college just as I
02:57 - was starting my programming Journey now
03:00 - compared to that with what you see now
03:02 - after about 15 years of programming of
03:05 - course correlation does not equal
03:06 - causation but it might be something to
03:09 - consider so next up Owen Kelly says why
03:12 - am I paying thousands to learn this at
03:14 - College when YouTube is so much better
03:16 - and Benji guy says John sir you explain
03:19 - this a lot better than a university I
03:21 - spend a lot of money at thank you you
03:23 - bloody legend and Mr genetics says
03:26 - paying thousands of dollars for
03:27 - university courses to be poorly taught
03:29 - from a careless and lifeless teacher and
03:31 - here this man taught a concept I clearly
03:33 - grasped in seven minutes God bless the
03:35 - American education system and so yeah I
03:38 - really do appreciate these kinds of
03:39 - comments I'm I'm always genuinely happy
03:42 - that that I'm able to help people grasp
03:46 - subjects that they spend hours in a
03:49 - class or maybe looking through other
03:51 - kinds of videos and just it didn't make
03:53 - sense and and there there was just some
03:55 - there was just some little Gap that they
03:59 - couldn't quite make the the mental leap
04:00 - for like I I see what like you're trying
04:03 - to tell me something and I have all this
04:05 - understanding about about Java and
04:07 - programming but I don't know what you're
04:09 - trying to get at and and what I try to
04:11 - do in my videos is is identify what I
04:15 - think that Gap is and then what I try to
04:18 - do is just lay out the path across that
04:21 - Gap as succinctly and clearly as I can
04:25 - figure out a way to do and there are a
04:27 - few videos that I'm especially proud of
04:30 - that I think I've done that really well
04:31 - with the video on generics I've gotten a
04:34 - lot of feedback about that that's one
04:35 - I'm really proud of now that said all
04:38 - these people saying you know thank you
04:40 - I'm paying thousands of dollars you know
04:41 - taking some class at a college or
04:43 - wherever else my Java course is a tiny
04:46 - fraction of the cost of one class and
04:49 - one semester that you might have in a
04:51 - college or university you know link down
04:54 - in the description yeah just saying next
04:56 - we have a Sicily Villa who says are you
04:59 - a medalist and Vic says so you're
05:02 - telling me that not only are you really
05:03 - good at teaching but you also have great
05:06 - taste in music as well and yes it is
05:08 - absolutely true I I love music I
05:10 - especially love metal and I know they're
05:12 - like the most popular metal band in the
05:14 - world so it's not really cool to like
05:15 - them but Metallica definitely is my
05:18 - favorite band I play guitar as you can
05:20 - see behind me I also have a bass but
05:22 - that's not my base that's a friend's
05:24 - base that they've just left here and I
05:26 - also do play the drums they used to be
05:28 - in the back of a lot of my videos but
05:30 - now they're I rearranged the room and
05:32 - it's over here it's off to the side I
05:33 - don't get the chance to play the drums
05:35 - anywhere near as much as I would like to
05:37 - nowadays with a wife and now two kids in
05:40 - the house I have been asked by a couple
05:42 - of people hey are you ever going to play
05:43 - any of those instruments in any of your
05:45 - videos I really don't see how it would
05:47 - ever make sense in any Java tutorial
05:49 - video but maybe in kind of a fun video
05:51 - like this uh maybe someday if I can
05:54 - think of some kind of a way that it
05:56 - would make sense to get it in sure I'm
05:58 - not against it next up we have a number
06:00 - of comments all with the same kind of
06:02 - theme like a buy H Mahmoud here who says
06:06 - I love this but why is it in 3x speed
06:09 - adidaio says you are too fast for a
06:11 - beginner couldn't follow Muhammad says
06:13 - you're too good and way too fast I watch
06:16 - the videos either at .75 or 0.5 am I
06:20 - normal so so yeah over the last couple
06:22 - of years I have gotten a fair number of
06:24 - comments saying hey you know you're just
06:26 - talking too fast I love your content but
06:28 - boy you just talk really fast and I
06:31 - guess I don't necessarily disagree but
06:34 - there there is a couple of things about
06:35 - that one is it's just kind of the way I
06:37 - talk and if I was trying to just talk
06:40 - about something in a natural way I'm
06:42 - going to talk in the speed that I would
06:43 - talk in real life and if I try and just
06:46 - slow it down like this it changes my
06:50 - whole manner of delivery and it's not
06:51 - really me being me giving off that
06:54 - information and I think it would I think
06:56 - it would come off like that I don't
06:58 - think people would get into it as much
07:01 - as they do when I try and just talk
07:04 - normally I try and do these videos as I
07:06 - would describe these topics to someone
07:09 - sitting next to me like if I talk more
07:11 - slowly like this maybe it's more
07:14 - understandable but it's a lot less I
07:16 - guess first it's a lot less fun for me
07:18 - because I don't just get to to talk and
07:21 - and describe something and get into it
07:23 - how I would normally like to do it and I
07:25 - think that kind of naturalness comes
07:29 - across on your side as well or at least
07:32 - I hope it does and so I do think it's
07:34 - true that there will be some people who
07:36 - might have to watch at a slower speed or
07:37 - go back and re-watch things every time I
07:41 - record or edit one of these videos I'm
07:43 - trying to strike kind of a balance I'm
07:45 - trying to actually get the information
07:47 - across in a way that's digestible but
07:50 - I'm also trying to keep people
07:52 - interested and keep people watching of
07:54 - course if I dive off into every little
07:56 - detail and describe everything really
07:58 - slowly and and methodically a hundred
08:01 - percent of the time A lot of people are
08:03 - going to get just bored forward watching
08:04 - it and they're going to go off somewhere
08:06 - else so I'm always trying to find that
08:08 - balance sometimes I might be a little
08:10 - bit too fast sometimes I might get too
08:12 - In The Weeds on a particular subject I
08:14 - apologize I'm doing my best I promise
08:17 - next we have this individual who
08:18 - apparently goes by uh 12 who says can
08:21 - you record your video without your face
08:23 - because it takes a lot size of megabytes
08:27 - and also Makita who says we actually
08:30 - don't really need to see you this close
08:31 - in your videos even when I downside the
08:33 - video window your face and head are
08:35 - still way too big so yeah that I don't
08:38 - know I'm putting my face in the videos
08:39 - was something that I decided on really
08:42 - really early like I think my very first
08:44 - video had my face in it I do think that
08:48 - showing my face in my videos allows me
08:50 - to get just I don't know a little bit
08:52 - more of a personal connection I I like
08:54 - being able to see the person who's
08:57 - teaching me something then I can see
08:58 - that if they're excited about something
09:00 - I can be excited about it at the
09:02 - beginning it absolutely made me very
09:04 - very self-conscious and it also makes
09:06 - you know recording these videos more of
09:08 - a complicated Affair you know I have to
09:10 - have lighting I had to buy a camera I
09:13 - have to try and make myself not look
09:14 - absolutely awful and I do try to make my
09:17 - head as unobtrusive as I can I put it
09:20 - off in the corner whenever it's
09:21 - obstructing some text I move it out of
09:23 - the way but uh I don't know if you can't
09:25 - stand seeing my face at all maybe you
09:27 - can put something over you know that
09:29 - corner of the screen to block it out it
09:30 - is a little bit weird of a concept for
09:32 - someone to be like hey I like your
09:34 - YouTube videos but man I can't stand
09:36 - your face next up billel says great and
09:39 - professional what is the tool you are
09:40 - using to record and manage it please so
09:43 - that is a question I do get occasionally
09:45 - basically how do you go about creating
09:48 - these videos what tools do you use let's
09:50 - hope let's just talk about that a little
09:51 - bit since the very beginning I've been
09:53 - using OBS to record my screen I think
09:56 - that stands for open broadcaster
09:57 - software it's completely free it's the
10:00 - full featured it has everything you
10:02 - could possibly want to record your
10:03 - screen and you can also do streaming
10:05 - with it which I have not done yet I also
10:07 - record my audio all through OBS and I
10:11 - actually use this little lapel mic that
10:13 - I got off of Amazon for like 12 it's
10:16 - still basically the same one that I used
10:18 - right at the beginning and that's
10:20 - plugged directly into my computer and
10:22 - you can see right here that it's
10:24 - recording my audio right here through
10:26 - OBS now as for the video Until not very
10:30 - long ago at all maybe just a few months
10:31 - ago I just used my phone and I combine
10:34 - it with the audio and the screen cap
10:35 - captured by OBS and that's what I would
10:38 - use now especially because of the kind
10:40 - of content that I produce you know it's
10:42 - not very video heavy I have my face but
10:45 - other than that you know the important
10:46 - part is the screen capture so the camera
10:48 - wasn't especially important I think
10:50 - what's more important is the audio I've
10:53 - had a lot of people complain about the
10:55 - audio near the beginning when I didn't
10:57 - really know what I was doing and I still
10:59 - kind of don't know what I'm doing but I
11:00 - at least know enough that I need to you
11:03 - know tree treat the room that I'm in to
11:06 - make it not sound awful and not record
11:08 - right next to an air conditioner like I
11:11 - have done a couple of times now I do
11:13 - have an actual camera that I record on
11:15 - um it's what I'm staring at right now
11:16 - it's a Sony zve E10 it's not super fancy
11:20 - but um I think it gives good video
11:23 - quality and it was relatively
11:24 - inexpensive and now I don't have to use
11:27 - my phone anymore now as for what I'm
11:28 - recording on
11:30 - um here I'll just show you
11:31 - so I am just sitting in front of my
11:36 - laptop so I don't even use you know a
11:38 - big fancy desktop it's just a relatively
11:40 - inexpensive laptop that I have done all
11:43 - my programming videos with now as far as
11:45 - video editing goes uh ever since the
11:47 - beginning all the way up to now all I've
11:49 - used is a free tool called DaVinci
11:52 - Resolve I didn't know anything at all
11:53 - about video editing before I got started
11:55 - so I just kind of learned as I went I
11:57 - think the only thing that I actually
11:58 - spent money on was the microphone and
12:01 - that was twelve dollars it was literally
12:04 - this microphone cost twelve dollars link
12:06 - down in the description if you want it
12:08 - but it's basically just a no-name Amazon
12:10 - brand so if you're thinking of starting
12:12 - a channel like this but worried about
12:13 - the cost of any sort of equipment and
12:15 - stuff like that that you need don't
12:16 - worry about buying a fancy camera
12:18 - especially at first you can get really
12:20 - really far just with your phone make
12:23 - sure your audio is decent I think people
12:25 - will leave your video way faster for bad
12:28 - audio than they will for bad video next
12:31 - we have Patrick who said says man I just
12:33 - love you so much this is so clear and
12:35 - understandable and mgtv says dude I love
12:39 - you and Malak says simply I love you so
12:43 - that is all um a little bit strange
12:45 - hearing that all from mainly men uh that
12:48 - I don't know personally but I guess all
12:50 - I can say to that is I love you too guys
12:52 - I love you too so if you enjoyed this
12:54 - kind of video let me know in the
12:56 - comments and maybe we'll do more like
12:57 - this in the future and if you have any
12:59 - of your own questions either programming
13:01 - or not programming related uh go ahead
13:03 - and let me know in the comments too and
13:04 - you might just see them answered in an
13:06 - upcoming video a lot like this one and
13:09 - as always thank you so much for watching
13:10 - I really appreciate you being here and
13:13 - just hanging out with me I'll see you
13:15 - next time
