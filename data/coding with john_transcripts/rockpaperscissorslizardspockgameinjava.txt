00:00 - in this video we are going to enhance
00:01 - the rock paper scissors game that we
00:03 - made
00:03 - and implement a full rock paper scissors
00:05 - lizard spock
00:06 - game in java this one is for all the
00:09 - programmers out there who are somehow
00:10 - even bigger nerds than me
00:12 - if you haven't already seen the rock
00:13 - paper scissors video go ahead and click
00:14 - here to view it it won't take long to
00:16 - get through that and it'll just be a few
00:17 - easy enhancements to create rock paper
00:19 - scissors lizard spock
00:20 - if you're new to the channel my name is
00:21 - john and i make a java tutorial video
00:24 - every single week either a video on java
00:25 - topic or a full programming tutorial
00:27 - walking through
00:28 - how to create something from scratch be
00:30 - sure to leave a like and hit the
00:31 - subscribe button so you don't miss the
00:32 - new video every week thank you for
00:33 - taking the time to like and subscribe
00:35 - it's the only way these videos get out
00:36 - to help more people and so i really do
00:38 - appreciate it and as always the full
00:39 - java source code for this rock paper
00:41 - scissors lizard spot game is available
00:43 - in the link down in the description so
00:44 - go and grab it the original rock paper
00:46 - scissors source code is also available
00:48 - in a link down in the description
00:49 - so you can grab that if you want to
00:51 - build off of it to make rock paper
00:52 - scissors
00:53 - lizard spock yourself first like i said
00:55 - if you haven't seen the original rock
00:56 - paper scissors video
00:58 - go ahead and watch it here we're going
01:00 - to start with that code because it gives
01:02 - us all the structure that we need the
01:03 - flow of the game
01:04 - the randomness the computer move the
01:06 - player move all the main
01:08 - flow and aspects of the game are going
01:10 - to stay the same we're just going to
01:11 - take that rock paper scissors game
01:13 - and add some enhancements to make it a
01:15 - rock paper scissors lizard spock
01:17 - game so this is our original rock paper
01:19 - scissors game and let's just do a quick
01:21 - run through of how it works
01:22 - well the whole game is structured in a
01:23 - wild true loop so you can just keep
01:25 - playing repeatedly if you want to
01:26 - and we start with this array of strings
01:29 - r p and s for rock paper scissors
01:31 - and to do the computer move we just pick
01:32 - a random element from that array and
01:34 - then to get the player move we just
01:36 - print out please enter your move
01:37 - and then use the scanner class to get
01:39 - the string input from the user
01:41 - we expect the user to enter either r p
01:43 - or s for rock paper or scissors
01:44 - and if they don't send in one of those
01:46 - we say hey that's not a valid move
01:48 - and go to the top of this while true
01:50 - loop here again so they can re-enter
01:52 - and then after that we have the computer
01:53 - move and the player move and all that's
01:55 - left is to do the logic
01:56 - of who wins and print out the result so
01:59 - we print out the computer played
02:00 - whatever they played and then the logic
02:02 - for printing out the result begins
02:04 - first if the player move and the
02:05 - computer move are equal if they're the
02:07 - exact same then we say the game was a
02:08 - tie
02:09 - otherwise we have a section for if the
02:11 - player move was rock
02:12 - so if the player move is rock and the
02:14 - computer move is paper then we say that
02:16 - you lose because paper covers rock
02:17 - otherwise if the computer picks scissors
02:19 - you win because rock crushes scissors
02:21 - and then we have a section for if the
02:22 - player move is paper
02:24 - of course paper covers rock scissors
02:25 - cuts paper and then lastly we have the
02:27 - section for if the player move was
02:28 - scissors
02:29 - scissors cuts paper and rock crushes
02:31 - scissors and then we just ask the user
02:33 - if they want to play again
02:34 - and if they enter the letter y it
02:35 - restarts the loop again and allows the
02:37 - player to play all over again
02:38 - and if they enter anything else the game
02:40 - ends so overall pretty simple pretty
02:42 - straightforward right it's a good
02:43 - beginner game to make
02:44 - so now how do we enhance this to make
02:46 - rock paper scissors
02:47 - lizard spock basically we're going to
02:49 - keep the same structure we're not going
02:51 - to change how the game flows or anything
02:52 - like that
02:53 - we just need to redo the set of moves
02:56 - that are possible for the computer and
02:57 - the player to make and then down here we
02:59 - need to make a lot of changes
03:00 - to how the logic works for determining
03:02 - who wins and printing out the result
03:04 - because there are a lot more
03:05 - possibilities
03:06 - with five different options than with
03:08 - just three so first let's just start
03:09 - here
03:10 - at the top the string array of possible
03:13 - moves that we have
03:14 - is right now just rpns rock paper or
03:16 - scissors so
03:17 - instead let's go ahead and add the two
03:20 - options for lizard and spock
03:22 - so for lizard of course we can just add
03:24 - l as a possibility
03:25 - now since spock also starts with an s
03:28 - and that's competing
03:28 - with the s for scissors let's go ahead
03:31 - and just pick a different one how about
03:33 - k because k is at the end of spock i
03:35 - really want to keep it one letter to
03:37 - make it easy for the user to input and
03:39 - so we can just make it k
03:40 - to make it different from everything
03:41 - else and so now that we have more
03:43 - options here we should probably rename
03:44 - our string array variable from rps to
03:46 - rps lk
03:48 - now a fancy way you can do this if you
03:50 - are working in an ide like eclipse
03:52 - you can use the rename functionality so
03:53 - i can hit alt shift
03:55 - r when i'm selecting rps and then i can
03:59 - change this to be
04:00 - rps lk hit enter and you can see that
04:02 - it's automatically
04:04 - changing that variable name everywhere
04:05 - it's used so that's super convenient
04:07 - as we move down in the code we can see
04:09 - that the computer move is already
04:11 - selecting
04:12 - a random element from that array and it
04:15 - uses the length of the array to get that
04:16 - random element
04:17 - so even though we added a couple of
04:19 - options to the array
04:21 - it should now automatically include
04:23 - those two as possibilities so there's
04:25 - nothing we need to do there at all
04:26 - moving down in the code we have a system
04:28 - out print line statement that says
04:30 - please enter your move
04:31 - rp or s so we do need to change this to
04:34 - r p
04:35 - s l or k rock paper scissors lizard
04:39 - or spock and then we collect the next
04:41 - move from the player
04:42 - no change needed there and now we have
04:44 - our validation where if the player
04:46 - enters rp or s
04:48 - we break out of this loop because they
04:49 - entered something valid so we do need to
04:51 - add lizard and spock as
04:53 - options here so we'll just copy and
04:56 - paste
04:56 - that blizzard and spock so we got r p
05:00 - s l and k are now all valid moves for
05:03 - the player all right then
05:04 - below that we just have a print
05:06 - statement where we print out what the
05:07 - computer played
05:08 - no change needed there and then here is
05:10 - where most of our changes are going to
05:12 - take place where we're printing out
05:14 - the results of the game and who won no
05:17 - changes needed to this first part here
05:18 - where
05:19 - if the player move is equal to the
05:20 - computer move it's still a tie but we do
05:22 - need to add
05:23 - all of the combination results uh now
05:26 - that we have
05:26 - lizard and spock added as possibilities
05:29 - so all of the rest
05:30 - of this logic is going to be changed up
05:33 - quite a bit
05:33 - now what are the actual rules to this
05:35 - game that we need to implement so i
05:37 - brought up
05:37 - this image here that i found on
05:39 - instructables so what we've got is
05:41 - rock crushes lizard lizard eats paper
05:43 - lizard poison spock
05:44 - spock vaporizes rocks box smashes
05:46 - scissors sisters decapitates lizard
05:48 - scissors cuts paper paper disproves
05:50 - spock
05:50 - paper covers rock and as always rock
05:53 - crushes scissors so it's basically all
05:54 - the interactions with the lizard
05:56 - and the spock that are new to our logic
05:59 - that we need to add so let's just move
06:00 - down the code in our logic
06:02 - and add what we need to so first we have
06:04 - a section
06:05 - for if the player chooses rock so
06:08 - underneath
06:08 - that inside this else if we're going to
06:10 - have all the conditions that the
06:12 - computer could play
06:13 - against it so right now we have a
06:14 - condition for if the computer chooses
06:16 - paper
06:16 - and scissors and so we just need to add
06:18 - two other conditions
06:20 - for lizard and spock but just for fun
06:22 - also let's go ahead and
06:23 - type what the result is in addition to
06:26 - just whether the player wins or loses so
06:28 - for example here if the player plays
06:30 - rock
06:30 - and the computer plays paper we can
06:32 - print out paper
06:34 - covers rock and then you lose
06:37 - and here we have rock crushes scissors
06:40 - you win so now let's copy this else and
06:44 - create the condition for if the computer
06:47 - played
06:47 - lizard against the player's rock let's
06:50 - go off our cheat sheet here for
06:51 - rock and lizard rock crushes lizard so
06:54 - rock crushes
06:55 - lizard and the player wins and then
06:58 - let's copy that again
06:59 - for the spock play remember spock is k
07:02 - and not s and it is a spock vaporizes
07:06 - the rock
07:07 - spock vaporizes
07:10 - rock so in that case the player loses
07:13 - okay so that should cover all the
07:14 - conditions where the player played
07:16 - rock paper covers rock and so i would
07:18 - lose rock crushes scissors
07:20 - so i would win rock crushes the lizard
07:22 - too so i win
07:23 - spock vaporizes the rock so i would lose
07:26 - the rock is covered let's move down
07:28 - to paper we'll have similar things here
07:30 - so paper versus rock we have
07:31 - paper covers rock you win scissors cuts
07:35 - paper
07:36 - you lose and then let's copy this else
07:39 - for lizard and spock l and k
07:43 - so paper versus lizard is lizard eats
07:45 - paper
07:46 - lizard eats paper so i lose
07:50 - and then paper disproves spock so i win
07:54 - spock win all right that covers all of
07:57 - the paper scenarios where the player
07:59 - plays paper
08:00 - and the last of our current entries here
08:02 - is for scissors
08:03 - of course scissors cuts paper rock
08:05 - crushes scissors
08:07 - as it always has you lose copy paste
08:10 - our else ifs for lizard and spock l
08:13 - and k so scissors decapitates a lizard
08:17 - scissors decapitates blizzard
08:20 - so i would win as the scissors player
08:23 - spock smashes scissors
08:24 -  smashes scissors
08:28 - so i lose that covers all of these
08:30 - scissors scenarios now since in our
08:32 - original game the computer couldn't play
08:33 - lizard or spock we need
08:35 - whole other sections for when the
08:36 - computer plays a lizard or spock so
08:38 - we're going to copy this
08:40 - entire section and paste it down here
08:42 - for if the player
08:43 - plays lizard so let's go down the line
08:46 - lizard versus paper lizard eats paper
08:48 - eats paper you win rock crushes the
08:52 - lizard
08:52 - so i lose now here now since we copy
08:55 - pasted we have a lizard versus
08:57 - lizard the tie games are accounted for
08:59 - way at the top
09:00 - so we actually need to change this to uh
09:02 - scissors but the result here is the same
09:04 - the scissors decapitates lizard but
09:06 - since i'm the lizard here i lose
09:08 - i'm getting decapitated i'm getting
09:10 - decapitated which is always
09:12 - an inconvenience now lizard versus spock
09:14 - it turns out
09:15 - lizard poison spock zerd poisons
09:19 - spock so since the player played lizard
09:21 - you can say you win
09:23 - alright so that covers all the scenarios
09:24 - where the player played
09:26 - lizard let's copy and paste all of that
09:29 - one more time for when the player plays
09:32 - spock
09:32 - k now we have spock versus paper which
09:35 - is paper disproves
09:37 - spock so in that case since i'm spock i
09:39 - lose
09:40 - nexbach versus rock and in that case
09:42 - spock vaporizes
09:44 - the rock spock vaporizes
09:47 - rock so the player wins we have spock
09:50 - versus scissors
09:51 - spock smashes scissors
09:54 - smashes scissors so the player wins
09:57 - and now here again since we copy pasted
09:59 - we currently have a spock versus spock
10:01 - so we need to change this to a spock
10:02 - versus lizard and we already have the
10:05 - outcome here lizard does poison spock
10:07 - but in this one since i am spock
10:09 - i would lose because i'm getting
10:11 - poisoned okay that should account for
10:13 - all the different possibilities let's do
10:15 - some play testing and see if everything
10:17 - works as it should so i'll hit ctrl
10:19 - f11 to play the game so i'm just going
10:21 - to play through this a handful of times
10:22 - and make sure everything's working fine
10:24 - let's play a spock computer play lizard
10:27 - lizard poison spock you
10:28 - lose so it's working play again yes or
10:30 - no i can enter y and play again
10:32 - and to remove a lizard lizard eats paper
10:35 - i win
10:35 - okay i'm gonna do this a whole bunch of
10:36 - times to get a really thorough test
10:46 - okay i think i encountered every single
10:48 - scenario the game could offer and all of
10:50 - them
10:50 - worked great now you have a fully
10:52 - functioning rock paper scissors lizard
10:55 - spock
10:55 - java program so if you've got friends
10:57 - who are big bang theory fans or
10:58 - especially those who are programmers
11:00 - it's pretty cool right you made your own
