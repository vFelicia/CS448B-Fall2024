00:00 - we are going to implement one of the
00:01 - worst sorting algorithms in the world
00:03 - in java it's not fast it's pretty much
00:05 - just a
00:06 - two-line sorting algorithm while the
00:09 - list
00:09 - is not sorted we're going to call
00:12 - collections.shuffle
00:14 - and pass in our list we check to see if
00:16 - the list is sorted
00:17 - and if not we shuffle it and we keep
00:19 - going until it magically is
00:21 - sorted and then we'll print everything
00:23 - out for our list of just
00:25 - three elements it basically finishes
00:26 - right away so it's got to be super
00:28 - speedy right well maybe and instead of
00:30 - just having three elements
00:31 - i'm going to increase it to 14 and see
00:34 - what happens so i'm back here the next
00:35 - morning to find so we started last night
00:37 - at 9
00:38 - 25 and finally finished this morning at
00:41 - 2
00:41 - 17 that means it took about
00:44 - five hours to sort 14
00:48 - numbers
