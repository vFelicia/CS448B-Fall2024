00:00 - i lead a team of software engineers and
00:01 - today i want to tell you about
00:03 - five things you can do in an interview
00:04 - that'll put you ahead of 95 percent of
00:06 - the competition
00:07 - now if you're already interviewing at
00:09 - our company we already know you can do
00:11 - everything your resume says you can do
00:13 - you can code what we need you to code
00:15 - you can do the work of the job but what
00:17 - we want to know is do we want to have
00:19 - you on our team
00:21 - not everybody who can code what you need
00:23 - them to code is a human being that you
00:24 - want to have on your team and talk to
00:26 - every day
00:27 - number one do i enjoy
00:31 - talking with you i'm about to
00:33 - potentially spend
00:35 - eight hours a day every single day
00:37 - having to talk with you
00:39 - interact with you work with you and deal
00:41 - with you
00:42 - that's more time that i get to spend
00:43 - with my family most days now is that
00:45 - time spent interacting with you going to
00:46 - be fun
00:47 - and engaging or is it going to feel like
00:49 - a chore am i going to dread it every
00:52 - time
00:53 - do you communicate well are you engaging
00:55 - are you asking questions or am i having
00:57 - to pull
00:58 - every word you say out of you you just
01:00 - sit there twiddling your thumbs waiting
01:02 - for other people to say something
01:04 - answering questions and one or two word
01:07 - sentences
01:08 - or not explaining them you don't seem
01:10 - excited just overall
01:12 - can we have a good fun conversation
01:16 - where i think you're going to be a
01:17 - delight to have on my team
01:19 - just that alone puts you so far ahead of
01:22 - so many people
01:23 - and number two do you genuinely seem
01:26 - interested
01:27 - in working with us you might not think
01:29 - that's something we should care about
01:30 - you might just think okay i want money
01:33 - you want programming
01:34 - i can give you some programming and you
01:35 - can give me some money and we'll all be
01:37 - happy
01:38 - that's kind of how i felt directly
01:40 - coming out of college too like hey look
01:41 - i have these skills
01:43 - these are the skills you want i'm a very
01:45 - nice person so
01:46 - just hire me but now being on this side
01:49 - of things
01:50 - i don't want somebody who's not excited
01:53 - to be a part of whatever it is we're
01:54 - doing
01:55 - and even if your team isn't doing
01:56 - something super exciting like you're
01:58 - coding
01:58 - web services or you're making a website
02:01 - you know you're not working at spacex
02:02 - you're not going to mars
02:04 - but still you could you could be excited
02:06 - about working with what you enjoy doing
02:08 - every day
02:09 - you could seem interested in us as a
02:11 - team and us as people when you're
02:13 - working with someone who just wants to
02:14 - punch a clock and collect a paycheck
02:16 - you're not going to be nearly as
02:17 - productive as a group of people who are
02:19 - excited to be doing what they're doing
02:21 - and excited to be working together
02:23 - and that's the kind of person i want on
02:24 - my team number three
02:26 - if you've had a previous software
02:28 - development job
02:30 - what was it can you explain it and don't
02:32 - just talk about the technologies you use
02:34 - or i use
02:35 - java and spring and we use
02:38 - hibernate and i coded an eclipse
02:42 - and we made a website
02:45 - we made a web service
02:49 - i coded for uh customers
02:53 - um no i want you to be able to explain
02:57 - what the thing that you worked on did
03:00 - why it mattered how it fit
03:01 - into the business that you were working
03:03 - with the value that it provided
03:06 - what that tells me is that that person
03:08 - can really think
03:09 - about the value that they're trying to
03:11 - provide for their company
03:12 - and not just taking a piece of work that
03:15 - they have to do
03:16 - and doing it blindly i want them to be
03:18 - able to think about what they're doing
03:20 - and be able to deliver the value that we
03:22 - want to deliver
03:23 - and not always just blindly follow some
03:26 - directions you're given
03:27 - and again you might just think uh who
03:30 - cares tell me what to code
03:32 - i'll code the thing it's my job to code
03:34 - stuff
03:35 - you just tell me what to code and
03:37 - everybody will be happy
03:39 - no i want you engaged in the
03:41 - conversation of the needs that we're
03:43 - trying to deliver
03:44 - know what you've done be able to explain
03:47 - it and be excited about it too
03:49 - number four if you've had a previous job
03:51 - you've probably done code reviews at
03:53 - that
03:54 - job what i want to know is how you do
03:57 - those code reviews
03:58 - there's so many people that i know that
03:59 - just look at a pull request
04:01 - and go yeah i mean i guess it looks fine
04:04 - um
04:04 - there's nothing that seems to be spelled
04:06 - wrong or
04:08 - i guess it's fine it's a pretty small
04:10 - change or it's it's such a huge change
04:12 - and i don't care
04:13 - that person is pretty good at coding so
04:15 - they probably is probably
04:16 - right it probably works how it's
04:19 - supposed to work
04:20 - now please if you're going to review
04:21 - code review it
04:23 - pull the code down run the test boot up
04:26 - the application
04:27 - test that the code actually does what it
04:29 - says it's supposed to do now if you're
04:30 - somebody who pulls down the code
04:32 - runs the test boots up the application
04:34 - and actually tests the functionality
04:36 - you're doing more and you're doing
04:37 - better than again
04:39 - 95 of people doing code reviews and
04:42 - better than 95 percent of people who are
04:43 - interested in joining our team
04:45 - it puts you way ahead of the curve
04:47 - number five
04:48 - be able to communicate well in writing
04:50 - and no i don't mean handwriting i mean
04:52 - emails ims unfortunately this isn't
04:55 - really something that can jump out well
04:57 - in an interview
04:58 - most of the time the person starts
04:59 - working for you and you realize you
05:01 - can't understand what they're saying in
05:02 - their emails or ims
05:04 - they aren't clear they're always leaving
05:06 - things out or you just don't understand
05:08 - really what they're trying to say
05:10 - or you see them in an email talking to a
05:11 - manager and you just know
05:13 - that manager is going to have no idea
05:15 - what they're trying to say and you're
05:16 - going to have to clear it up
05:17 - so what i'm looking for is somebody who
05:19 - can be just as clean and articulate
05:22 - and descriptive in their
05:25 - written communication as they are in
05:27 - their verbal communication
05:29 - and so that's something i guess i might
05:30 - look at your resume for so i mean if
05:32 - there's a bunch of just
05:33 - misspellings and i can't quite make out
05:36 - what you're trying to say in some of
05:37 - these sentences
05:38 - it's gonna make me go man i know this
05:40 - person is gonna be a chore to talk with
05:43 - over emails and ims every day and i'm
05:46 - just not gonna wanna do it
05:47 - that's a huge deal now with everybody
05:48 - working from home and the vast majority
05:50 - of communication that we do with each
05:52 - other
05:53 - is over im or over email i promise if
05:56 - you do those five things
05:58 - as long as you're a halfway decent
05:59 - programmer you're going to have
06:01 - teams just begging you to join them
06:03 - overall what i think all of these can be
06:05 - condensed to
06:06 - is be a delightful person to work with
06:09 - nobody wants to work with
06:10 - a really great programmer who's just a
06:13 - jerk and impossible to get an answer
06:15 - from
06:16 - we would much rather work with somebody
06:17 - who you can talk to have some back and
06:19 - forth with
06:20 - and just have a good time with while
06:22 - getting things
06:23 - done properly because you're able to
06:25 - have such good conversations and
06:26 - interact with these people well
06:28 - you're going to get better solutions
06:32 - faster i would much rather work with
06:33 - somebody whose programming skills are
06:35 - pretty good but they're amazing to work
06:37 - with great to talk to
06:39 - than somebody who's a great programmer
06:41 - but just really quiet you can't get a
06:43 - word out of and when they do speak it
06:44 - just doesn't make sense they can't
06:46 - explain what they've done
06:47 - just know it makes your face go like
06:49 - this
