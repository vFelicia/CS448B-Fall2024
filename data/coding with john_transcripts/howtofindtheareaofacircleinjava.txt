00:00 - hey how's it going john here today we're
00:02 - going to do a quick
00:03 - tutorial of how to find the area of a
00:05 - circle
00:06 - in java before we get started here i
00:08 - want you to know the full source of this
00:09 - program is available in a link down
00:11 - below
00:12 - so go get it we're going to make it
00:14 - quick and easy so
00:15 - let's get started so so of course the
00:17 - formula for the area of a circle is just
00:19 - pi r squared pi times the radius
00:22 - squared so what we're going to do in
00:24 - this program is accept a radius as input
00:26 - from the user
00:28 - and then print out the area of the
00:29 - circle from that but first we're going
00:31 - to need to get the radius from the user
00:32 - so to do that we're going to use the
00:34 - scanner class we'll create a new scanner
00:37 - called scanner
00:39 - equals new scanner
00:43 - and then we're going to use system dot
00:45 - in which is
00:47 - used for keyboard input we'll go ahead
00:50 - and
00:51 - import what we need to for scanner it's
00:52 - java util scanner if you aren't using a
00:55 - fancy ide like this that auto imports it
00:57 - now to get the radius as input from the
00:59 - user we're going to call a method on the
01:01 - scanner
01:02 - called next double because we're going
01:04 - to get that radius
01:06 - as a double so the user can type in
01:09 - decimal numbers and stuff and don't just
01:10 - have to use whole numbers integers
01:12 - things like that they can type in
01:13 - 3.52 for the radius if they want we
01:16 - should be able to accept that
01:17 - now this next double method is what is
01:18 - going to allow the user to
01:20 - enter a double but we also want to
01:22 - actually save what they enter
01:24 - to a variable a radius variable so we're
01:27 - going to create
01:28 - a new double variable called
01:32 - radius that will be set to whatever the
01:34 - user types in here when we prompt them
01:36 - so we also probably want here just a
01:38 - quick message to the user to prompt them
01:40 - to actually
01:41 - input the radius so let's say system dot
01:45 - out dot print line
01:48 - please enter the radius
01:54 - and so the user will see please enter
01:55 - the radius and then they'll be prompted
01:56 - to do so
01:57 - on the next line so then after this line
01:59 - executes we'll have the radius from the
02:01 - user in this radius variable
02:02 - all we have to do is do the calculation
02:05 - and print it out
02:06 - so let's go ahead and start the print
02:08 - statement system.out.printline
02:13 - area of the circle is
02:18 - and then now is when we're going to do
02:21 - our calculation
02:22 - so as we know we need to do pi times r
02:25 - squared so first to get the value of pi
02:27 - and java is easy we're just going to use
02:29 - the
02:29 - math class that comes with java and
02:32 - we're going to use math.pi
02:35 - which gives us the value of pi as a
02:37 - double
02:38 - so that's great now we have to multiply
02:40 - pi times the radius squared and what's
02:42 - the easiest way to get the radius
02:43 - squared here
02:44 - well it's probably to just do radius
02:46 - times
02:47 - radius that's the radius squared that
02:49 - works great so really that should be
02:51 - about it let's go ahead and run it and
02:53 - see what happens
02:55 - okay so we get the prompt please enter
02:56 - the radius let's say we've got
02:59 - uh 5.5 like we said so the area of the
03:02 - circle is 95.03 blah blah blah blah so
03:05 - great now a good way quickly to just
03:08 - verify that it's giving you a right one
03:09 - is compare it against something else
03:11 - like say
03:12 - google's calculator so let's just enter
03:14 - the 5.5 value there
03:16 - and they give you about 95.03 for the
03:19 - area
03:20 - and that's exactly what we're getting
03:22 - awesome
03:23 - now a couple of cool things before we
03:25 - stop the video one is
03:27 - if you want to instead of doing this
03:29 - radius times radius here you want to be
03:32 - really cool
03:33 - you can use the math.pow method
03:37 - which takes one number and raises it to
03:39 - the power of another number
03:41 - so we can just call that and we can take
03:42 - the radius
03:44 - and raise it to the power of two
03:47 - and that'll give you radius squared
03:49 - without having to type out radius times
03:50 - radius
03:51 - it does the same thing but it looks way
03:53 - cooler and really what's more important
03:55 - in programming than being cool i mean
03:57 - who doesn't get into programming for all
03:58 - the chicks and everything
04:00 - trust me if you use math.pow you'll just
04:01 - be biting off the ladies
04:03 - so yeah let's just run that make sure we
04:04 - get the same output
04:06 - we'll put in 5.5 and we get great
04:10 - 95.03 still works now one more thing you
04:13 - might have noticed if you were running
04:14 - this yourself
04:15 - that if you run it and you give it a
04:17 - radius that is like not a number you
04:19 - give it some garbage
04:21 - you get an exception input mismatch and
04:23 - it's because it's trying to take
04:25 - what you're putting in for the input and
04:28 - put it into a double and it's not able
04:30 - to do that so it blows up you're not
04:31 - going to get any ladies if your program
04:33 - blows up on bad input so if you'd like
04:35 - to learn more about doing
04:36 - input validation when using the scanner
04:38 - class check out this other video i made
04:40 - which is a
04:41 - full tutorial about using the scanner
04:43 - class that includes
04:44 - input validation so if you're learning
04:46 - java and found this video helpful please
04:47 - be sure to tell me with a like
04:49 - and if you want to see more java
04:50 - tutorials like this in the future please
04:52 - be sure to
04:53 - not subscribe we already got way too
04:55 - many subscribers as it is i think we're
04:57 - at like
04:58 - 14 or something now double digits it's
04:59 - getting just out of control
05:01 - we want to keep this channel nice and
05:02 - exclusive to something like
05:04 - seven or eight people is probably the
05:05 - sweet spot for subscriber numbers and if
05:07 - you didn't like this video please
05:09 - be sure to leave an angry nasty comment
05:11 - down below i just
05:12 - love reading those and i just realized i
05:15 - spelled circle
05:16 - like a complete doofus i'm leaving it in
05:18 - if i look around online and i find
05:19 - source code like this and i see circles
05:21 - spelled like circle
05:22 - i'll know you stole it from me now we
05:24 - have to remember here
05:25 - as in all our videos we have to be good
05:27 - boy scouts and always
05:29 - close our scanner every time we're done
05:32 - using it
05:34 - and this is no exception make you feel
05:36 - good about yourself you close your
05:37 - scanner you know
05:38 - it's like you adopted a whole family of
05:40 - kittens you know maybe it's more like
05:41 - you adopted a whole family of elderly
05:43 - cats because uh
05:44 - people always overlook those everybody
05:46 - wants a kitten because kittens are so
05:47 - nice they're so fun
05:48 - yeah always be a good boy scout closure
05:50 - scanners alright see you guys next time
