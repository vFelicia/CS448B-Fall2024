00:00 - the simplest way to read text files in
00:01 - java we're going to use
00:03 - a buffered reader so buffer reader
00:05 - reader
00:06 - equals new buffered reader new
00:09 - file reader so just output.txt
00:12 - we also want to surround this with a try
00:14 - catch catch i o exception to read a line
00:17 - of text from our file we just call
00:19 - reader.readline
00:20 - we're going to just print it out to the
00:21 - console so system.out.printline
00:24 - reader.readline so we're going to read
00:26 - the line from the file and print it out
00:28 - to the console
00:28 - we do want to call reader.close as well
00:31 - to close our reader object okay now
00:33 - let's run it and see if we are reading
00:34 - from the file
00:35 - awesome we can see that it did read the
00:37 - first line of the file that we wrote
