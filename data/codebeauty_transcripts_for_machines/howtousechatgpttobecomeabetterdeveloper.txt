hi guys and welcome to my channel this video is going to be a little bit different go away in this video we are going to talk about artificial intelligence remember all the scary movies predicting AI rising to the power and being way smarter than us well maybe that time has already come that's exactly what we will find out in this video because a few days ago I went to my LinkedIn profile and everyone was talking about this AI tool called chat GPT so I decided to try it out and see what's all the buzz about and I was shocked so let me show you what I'm talking about please keep in mind that this AI has wide use but in this video we are going to focus mainly on how it can affect and help us as developers so here it is it has a very simple interface but let's see what it can actually do so let's say for example reverse a string in C plus plus let's see okay here is the explanation and then it gives you the code fantastic let's run the program and here is our hello world reversed how awesome is this but it's pretty simple example so let's see what else it can do so let's test its oop knowledge let's say create a user that has name age username and password in C plus plus let's see okay so here you get the explanation okay so it gave us the entire code and it created the class and then it also created the example of how to use this class and it's even writing the comments in code I mean how cool is this so let's copy this and paste it to my visual studio okay all the code is here and if I try to run this app let's see the result so here is our user amazing so since many of you very often ask me about data structures and algorithms let's see what it can do in that area so let's ask it to make a program that measures inserting time and compares the speed of a linked list and an array in C plus plus so let's see so it even continues giving additional explanations about this code but what I'm interested in is to see how this code will work so let's paste it to visual studio okay and let's run it okay and time to insert what is this is this one million elements into a linked list is 0.9 seconds and time to insert 1 million elements into an array is 0.001 seconds okay let's close this let's see why so it is because it has generated a static array not Dynamic array so that is the reason why inserting elements into an array is faster than into a linked list otherwise if it had been a dynamic array then linked list would be faster you can try and ask chat gbt to create a comparison between a linked list and dynamic array when it comes to inserting elements and see what you are going to get in that situation let's do something with algorithms let's say write AC plus algorithm to sort 10 random numbers in ascending order numbers should be bigger than 10 and smaller than one thousand okay so let's see how it's going to handle this okay so here's our finished result let's copy the code okay go to visual studio and let's see how this program behaves okay so here are our random numbers sorted in ascending order and all of them are between 10 and 1000 amazing so here is your homework solved in literally five seconds now let's try something different because chalk GPT is not only about programming but it has wide use so let's give it a different test let's say for example write a short but interesting and controversial post that would get me a lot of thumbs up let's see I'm becoming a drama Channel you know okay okay so I read this and it's very interesting but also very controversial topic because I believe that it hits different on the employer side and on the employee side so let me know what do you think in the comment section would you like for a four day work week to be introduced let's see if it will be able to reply to this request let's say can you write me a short story about a man who sold his dog because he didn't have money let's see I'm really interested in this one okay so once upon a time a man named John had a dog named Max John and Max were the best of friends and did everything together they went on long walks played fetch in the park and snuggled on the couch at night but one day John's financial situation took a turn for the worse he lost his job and found himself struggling to make ends meet he couldn't afford to buy Max food or pay for his vet bills and he knew he had to make a difficult decision okay now I am not going to read this anymore because I'm going to start crying so let's return to C plus plus topics okay let's see if it can create an entire application let's say for example make me a calculator app in C plus okay okay so here is the code for our app and I don't even need to test it because I can already see that is it of course there are different ways to make this application but one thing that I do want to test and one thing that I do want to try is this let's say translate it to C sharp let's see if it will be able to do this so I don't know if you see the same potential as I do but this is actually amazing this is just beta version and it's already able to translate an application into a different programming language so imagine what it will be able to do in a year or two years and even now I believe that it shouldn't have any problems to translate much bigger applications but there are too many users and servers are crashing it's just in it's better phase so I believe that currently it's just not able to return me translation for a million lines of code so this is actually amazing and another thing that I want you to notice is the similarities between C plus and C sharp so if you take a look for all of my viewers who are learning C plus plus I want you to take a look at this C plus application and then at this csharp application you can notice how similar they are like if else structure and then here you have console right line and console read line which are in c plus c in or console input and then C out or console output so very very similar and I always mentioned that once you have a good understanding of one programming language especially if that programming language is something like C plus plus then it's just a matter of syntax which you can practice in a couple of days do a couple of exercises before you are able to switch to another programming language so while we are talking about different programming languages let's try something different let's say create a pink now VAR with a list of top five best football players with HTML and CSS links should point to their Instagram profiles so let's see okay so here is the code I'm going to copy it paste it in my vs code and then save and I will run this okay so this is our nav bar it looks kind of ugly but let's see if it is functional let's see Cristiano Ronaldo so it takes us to his Instagram page actually and then Leo Messi okay and then Neymar Jr Robert Lewandowski and then foreign so as you can see the code is okay I don't know if the data is okay though for my male viewers who understand about football let me know in the comments so what is the conclusion is AI going to overtake our jobs I do believe that some Industries are going to be overtaken by AI in the near future Industries like construction warehousing Transportation so all the repetitive routine tasks that humans are performing especially physical tasks those are gone in the future and then AI is also writing music and creating art so should musicians and artists be concerned I don't know I also showed you what you can do in code and this is just better version I am personally very enthusiastic when it comes to all the improvements that AI is going to bring to our life especially to the medicine and space research genetics Health Plan and Longevity and life quality in general but I also have some concerns AI systems are designed to make decisions and take actions based on the data but they are not perfect and they can make mistakes and those mistakes can have very very negative consequences they can create Financial losses legal issues or even be very harmful to us humans or to our environment AI systems are very complex and they are extremely hard to understand especially because they constantly evolve and change so I understand all the people who are worrying about security because of AI so Chuck GPT says that it finished its training in 2021 and that it is not aware of later events and it also says that it cannot browse the internet but I'm going to leave you a couple of examples of what people are doing with chat GPT and what kind of responses they are getting back so that you can decide for yourself if this is true or not some of these people might be trolling or maybe not again you can decide so what do you think about this let me know in the comments I saw that a lot of people are concerned about Ai and I didn't make this video to scare you I needed to share this information because this is a very useful tool that you can use in order to help you to learn programming and it's completely free at least for now so AI is here and it is here to stay you cannot change it you can either be unhappy and whine about it or you can embrace it and use it for personal growth it's your choice so what is the conclusion of this video the conclusion is that I think you don't need me anymore I give you someone who is going to reply to all your programming questions and it was great honor to be your programming teacher all of these years but now I leave you in good hands thank you very much for watching and we are still going to see each other on Instagram bye
