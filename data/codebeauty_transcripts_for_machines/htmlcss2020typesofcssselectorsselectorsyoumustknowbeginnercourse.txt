hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another HTML and CSS for beginners and in this video I want to talk about CSS selectors so that is a topic that is very important for you to understand and it is something that you are going to come across very often in your programming career and you should understand it so make sure to watch the entire video because I do have some important tips and tricks to give you when it comes to this topic but before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and also click the bell icon so that you are notified when I publish my next video and also if you want you can follow me on my other social media platforms the link for those is going to be in the description so as I already said in this video I want to talk about different types of CSS selectors but first I want to explain what is selector so selectors we usually use when we want to select or defined an HTML element that we want to style so for example in this body section I'm going to add a paragraph of text so for that I'm using key tag and let's say that inside this paragraph I'm going to write a message this is a message like this and let's copy this paragraph three or four times so okay four times that is going to be enough and this element selector is the first one that I want to show you and element selector is something that you have already seen on my channel so how do you use element selector here in this head section I'm going to add style tag like this and then in this style tag I'm going to write the syntax of element selectors so you just write the name of your element which is B in this particular situation and then you open and close these curly brackets in which we are going to put the style for all t tags in this body so here I want to write the style for my paragraphs and let's save this for now and I want to open this document for to see how it looks without these styles which we are going to add later so I'm going to close this and then here is my HTML document and let's open it let's say open with Google Chrome oh I have opened it already so here we have this is a message and that paragraph is written four times okay so now if I open this document we want to style that paragraph with a different style so let's say that for example for this paragraph we want to style font size like this and let's say that the font size is going to be 20 pixels okay and then let's say that we want to align this text to the center as well so for that we are going to use text align property and we are going to say that the value is going to be Center so now when I save this and refresh it here as you can see this is a message has moved to the center and the font is larger as well so that was the example of element selector and another type of selector that I want to show you is going to be class selector what is class selector and how we use class selector for example let's say that all of these P tags are not the same so all these messages are not the same but let's say that this first one is going to be this is let's say error message like this and then the second one is going to be a warning like this so this is a warning message and then this third one is going to be in full message for example and then this fourth one let's say that is going to be error message as well okay like this so now we have written out different types of messages and when i refresh this you can see that they look pretty much the same and what I want to accomplish is for these messages to look different so according to their purpose let's say so we want this error message to for example red background and this warning message to have yellow background for example and then info should have blue or green I guess and that error again should have red background and how we are going to accomplish that for that I'm going to use something called class selector so here I am going to write class like this and then in these quotation marks I'm going to say that this P element is going to have a class that is called error like this so here I have created a paragraph element which has class that is called error and here you can put whatever name you want except that you cannot use a number to start the name of a class so I have called my class error and now I'm going to create that class here so the style for that class and how we do that you say dot and then you put the name of your class which is in my case error and then you open these curly brackets and in inside these curly brackets we are going to put the style for this error class so for the element that has this error class and let's say that we want to style that element so this paragraph here we want to style it with background color which is going to be let's say like Oh white quarrel okay so we want this white red color to be a background color of this element here and we want to copy this class on this paragraph element as well because this is error message as well so here I'm going to paste it and now after I have saved this if i refresh where is it if i refresh my page you can see that this is error message and this is error message as well is written here and we should correct this too this is an error message so I'm going to correct that very quickly I'm going to seed this is an error message and then this is an error message as well okay and then here this is an inflorescence like this so after i have styled my error messages i want to style these other paragraphs as well so here on this warning message I'm going to say class and then here I want to give it a class that is called warning like this and then here I want to create that class I'm going to copy the name so that I don't make mistake so warning class is going to have background color where is it background color so this light golden yellow something is going to be background color of our warning message so this is yellowish color and then I'm going to give a class to this info message as well so I'm going to say class and I'm going to call that class info like this and I'm going to create info class here as well so dot and then the name of your class and then in these curly brackets you put the styles that you want your class to have so here I know here I'm going to say that this info message is going to have background color of let's say white blue so it is going to be this one here it's a light blue color and now after I have saved this if i refresh it here you can see that now our warning message has this yellowish background and then our info message has this blue background okay where is my document so that was an example of a class selector so you write the name of your class in this class attribute and then here in your style tag or in your external CSS file you put dot and then the name of your class and then inside curly brackets you write the styles for that element so for the element that has that class and there is one thing that I want to show you and there's going to be really the priority so priority between this element selector and then this class selector so for example if I put here in this P style if I see a background color so this property here and I see that background color is going to be this line color so it is greenish color and then I saved this what do you expect for our paragraphs to have so which background color this line or this white coral light yellow or light blue so after I have saved this and if i refresh it here you can see the DS state with their previous background color so this one is red this one is yellow and then blue and then red as well and why is that the case because these classes the styles that you write in your classes have a higher priority than the styles that you write in your element selector so this has a higher priority than this here and whenever you bright the styles for a certain property in your element sorter and then you repeat that property in your class selector your class selector is going to have the priority over your element selector so this here is going to be overridden by this here or it is here or this here depending on which P tag we owe which P tag we are talking about and then there is another type of selector that I want to talk about and that is going to be really ID selectors so what is ID selector well let's say for example that this paragraph here is not just a simple message but it is a critical error message so this is critical error message for example let's say that we want to have a critical error message as well and we want to style that paragraph as an error so with this class that is this one here so this error class but we want to give it a specific style so which is going to be unique for this element only and for that we are going to use IDE so we are going to say I D like this and here I want to specify the name of this element and let's say that that name is going to be critical like this and this ID selector is really something that is used only once in your webpage so only one element should have this ID which is called critical you can give other IDs to your other elements but this one should only be present on one element so it is going to be this one here and after I have created this ID which is called critical I'm going to style it here and how do you style your ID selector you say hash tag and then you put the name of your selector which is this one here like this and then in these curly brackets I am going to write the Styles for this element here so for this element that has the ID of critical and let's say that I want to style this element so that it has higher font so I'm going to say font size and I want it to have font of 30 pixels o pixels like this and then let's say as well that I wanted to have color of text which is going to be white so I'm going to say color like this and that I want to give it a value of white so now if I save this and then refresh my page here you can see that now it has this error class and it is styled at center it has background color which is red and then it has this this font size of 20 pixels like the others and then it as well has this color a front which is black and now after i refresh it you can see that now it has gotten this higher so this this larger font and then this color of text which is white okay so that we have done use this ID selector and how do you use this ID selector you say the name of your element so the ID of your element you put that using your ID attribute and then in your Styles you specify this hash tag and then put the name of your ID and then in these curly brackets you put the Styles that you want to really style your element with and in this particular case it is this paragraph element here and there is one very important thing when it comes to the priority of this ID selector because this ID selector is more specific than the previous one ones that we have mentioned that mean is that it has the highest priority so it has higher priority than this element selector and it has higher priority than this class selector as well so these these ones that means that for example here if I specify background color so I'm going to copy this here and if I specify different background color than the one that we have specified here this element is going to have whatever we have specified in our ID selector styles so here I'm going to say for example red like this and now if I save this this should override this style here even though our paragraph element has both this class error and then this ID critical so after I have saved it if I come here and refresh it you can see that our critical your paragraph now has this really red background color that we have specified in our ID selector oh okay where is it so here's our code so let's repeat one more time we have talked about three types of selectors the first one was element selector and then class selector and then the third one was ID selector and we have said that lowest priority has this element selector so this one here after that priority has this class selector and then the highest priority of these three has this ID so but I really want to show you some more tips and some more different ways to style your elements so for example if you want to say more specifically that you want to style let's say this element here so you want to style your paragraph element and this one here this one that has this info class and you want to do that in a more specific manner than just writing the name of your class you can say for example I want to style the element the TAS class info like this and then in this particular situation this has priority over this because this is really more specific than this here so here you say please give me any element that has this info class and then here you say please give me the element that has info class or all P elements that have this info class and that here for example if I say background color background color like this and let's say that here I want to specify for example this yellow green so this greenish color previously we had this blue color so this like blue color on our info element and now we have specified background color which is this one here so this greenish color and now if i refresh my document as you can see our info message now has this light green background color because this here has higher priority than this here and if you want to specify even higher priority than this one you can use for example nesting so you can see I'm going to copy this and paste it here and instead of saying please give me all the elements that have this info class and there are P elements so that our paragraphs you can see for example body here so this would mean please give me all the elements that have this info class that are of type P and there are child of this body element which means that are inside this body element and if I specify here for example even another color so I say silver and then I say this and then I come here and refresh it you can see that this info message has gotten this silver background color why has that happened well because this has even higher priority than this one here meaning that the more specific that you are when you are specifying your styles and selecting your element that is going to have higher priority so that is going to be of a higher priority that when you specify a more general role so one more time we have talked about different types of selectors the first one that we have mentioned was our peak selector which is our element selector and we said that this one has the lowest priority so element selectors have the lowest priority because they are general they are very very general after that we have talked about these class selectors which you use really with this dot notation so you say dot and then the name of your class and how you use these on your tags you say class and then you specify the name of your class and then here whatever you put in your class that is going to override your element selector and after Dad so after your class selector the priority has this ID selector so how you use these id Software's you say hash tag and then the name of your element so the ID of your element which you specify using this ID property so this ID attribute on your start tag and then you really write the Styles inside these curly brackets and those Styles are going to override whatever you have put in your Styles that you have written in your class selector and then here we have specified a couple more ways that you can style your elements with and those are very specific situations where you want style an element that for example has bought a class and also you want to specify the name of that element so the type of that element and here we have a small specified the way for you to select nested elements on a specific way so you can write the name of the class or ID that that element has and then the name of that element itself so the tag that you have used which is in this particular situation P tag and that here you specify the name of the parent of that element and this nesting can go really however deep you need it so you can have here even more classes even more children if you need that so that was something that I wanted to show you in this video and I hope that you understood these examples and I hope that you understood different types of selectors if you have any questions write those in the comments down below and I'm going to answer those and also make sure to subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon and like this video if you learned something new and follow me on my other social media the link for those is going to be in the description on my channel thanks for watching and I'm going to see you in my next video bye
