hi guys and welcome to my channel long time no see so let's go straight to the point in this video i am going to show you how you can download install and set up everything related to a database and we are going to write our first sql queries together so the database that we are going to use is called interbase i'm going to leave a link to download it in the description so after you click that link you are going to get a page like this one so there are two versions of interbase interface 2020 server and then interface 2020 to go and ib lite the one that i will use in this video is 2020 server for windows linux and mac if you want to read differences you can read that here so click here on start for free and you should get um a registration form like this one so i'm going to fill this in okay so make sure to fill all of these fields in and then also check that you are not a robot at least i hope that you are not okay and then click on start and now we should get the download link so download installer here i'm going to download windows version okay and i will be back once this is downloaded okay so here is downloaded zip i'm going to extract it and then i'll open this folder and we are going to need this install windows application so double click on that and here we get pretty simple installation it's mostly next next finish so click on install and now we are going to wait for a couple of seconds okay now click on next and then accept terms and conditions next next uh what is this multiple instances uh no for now and then next here is the folder where it is going to store it so next and then here you can review what you have selected and if everything is okay click on install and now we are going to wait again so here you should enter a number that you received in your email after you registered so i'm going to check that and paste it here so here is my serial number and click on register and now it is done great so after you finish the installation you will need to run ib console so ib console okay and here you will get a message that says that you need to create a server so you will get a wizard like this one and if you accidentally close it don't worry you can open it again by right clicking here and click on add okay and here click on next and then server edition next and here you need to put default password for cisdba user uh let me very quickly check it and i will put it on the screen okay so here is the password and you can also click on this save password so that it doesn't ask again and then click on next you can put the description here for your server if you want and then click on finish and with that we have successfully created a server now we get an error message here which says that interbase server is not running and that is why you are not able to connect to that server if i double click click on this here we are not able to connect to the server so what we need to do is we need to start interbase server manager and then here just click on start and after you have done this you should be able to connect to your server so if i double click on this again as you can see we get this screen check mark which means that we have successfully connected to our server so what is the next step after you have created a server well let's create a database so right click on this part here databases and then click on create database okay and here you will need to insert a name for your database or actually select a location first and i'm going to store it into my documents folder so let's call it my first oh my first db like this and click on save okay here is your user your password uh you can click on save password if you want and then click on ok and now it's going to ask you for a password so let's input password and click on connect okay and now you should see this part here which says myfirstdb and then you should see this green checkmark which means that you are connected to your database so we have so far created a server created a database so now the time has come for me to show you how you can write your first sql query in order to create a table insert data into that table and so on now very quickly sql stands for structured query language which means that it is just like a programming language except that it is used to communicate with databases so it is a language that you use in order to create tables drop tables insert data read it delete it edit it and so on and if you want a separate course that is dedicated entirely to sql give this video a thumbs up and let me know in the comments so i can create that course if you want so in order to write sql code please select this little sql icon click on it and you should get a window like this one so here we are going to write sql code the first thing that i want to do is i want to create a table so i will say create table and let's call that table users like this and i'll put these parentheses and then at the end semicolon okay and then here i'm going to specify attributes for users so i will say that every user will have id and that id is going to be of type int and it will not be null like this so that is the first attribute and then let's also say that every user has name and name is going to be of type string and depth type in databases is called var char so i will say var char and that is going to be a variable number of characters and the maximum number of characters is going to be 30 you can put a different max limit here and then i'm also going to say that it will not be null like this and then also let's say that user will have age it will be of type int and not null okay and let's do another thing let's say primary key and for primary key we are going to set id of our user now this primary key part here means that every user is going to have a unique id and that id which is unique is going to be used in order to identify every single user so there can be two users that have the same name or the same age but there cannot be two users that have the same id and that is why that id will be used as a primary key again if you want a detailed course related to sql please let me know in the comments and i'm going to create that course there are a few things that i want to mention here first is that sql is not case sensitive which means that you can use both uppercase and lowercase letters in order to write it so i can say create like this but please just pick the option that you prefer and then stick to that because it makes it very hard to read if you use uppercase and then lowercase and then uppercase again and so on so i prefer to use lowercase but again it's going to work either way okay so that is the first thing and then the second thing is that name for our table i called it users but if you try to call it user you are going to notice that the name is bolded now and the reason for that is that user is a keyword in sql so you cannot use it as a name for your table that is why i will use users so plural and then as well since this table is going to be used to store multiple users of our application it only makes sense to name it with a plural so users so let's execute this query and it should create a table called users so i'm going to select this query and click on this little thunder symbol which says execute query or press f5 on your keyboard okay and now you should get this table here but since it didn't refresh i'm just going to close this very quickly and then open it again okay and now we have user stable and here are the fields of every user so id name and age so now let's add a few records let's insert a few records into this table there are two ways to insert a record into a database the first one is with user interface that interbase provides and the second one is by writing sql code i'm going to show you both but from now on for the most part we are going to stick to sql code because that is what most developers use like the only people that i've seen that use user interface are mostly managers who don't know how to write sql code so let's do that as i said i'm going to show you how you can insert a record with the help of user interface so you need to go to your database and then click on tables and here you are going to see your tables so double click on the table that you want and then here you need to click on data and here you get user interface that you can use in order to insert data so uh let's say id is going to be one and then name is going to be salvina norak and then age is going to be 27 okay and then you need to click on this uh post edit and then commit so commit that transaction okay so that is how you insert data with the help of user interface and you can use um these other options in order to delete or navigate through your data that is how you use user interface now let's see how you can use sql code where is it okay it is here so let's see if we can read this data first how we can read the data that we just added so i'm going to say select everything so select all from users like this this means select every record from users table select this query and press f5 and here you will get the data from this table okay so this is your first sql query now let's see how we can insert some data with the help of sql code and again if you want detailed course an entire course related to sql only let me know in the comments so how to insert data with sql well you say insert into users so please insert into and then specify the name of your table and here you need to specify the fields and you have the fields here so id name and age like this okay and then here you will say values so here are the values that you need to insert for these fields so id is going to be let's say one again and then for the name since that is a string type which is varchar in sql you need to put these single quotation marks and inside it you will put the name so let's say bill gates like this and then age is 50 okay so if i want to execute this query i will select it and i will press f5 and we get an error now what this error here says actually we are going to get two errors but the first one is it says attempted update during readonly transaction now let's close this and let me show you how to fix this so go to transactions and then options okay and here you need to set access mode to right and click ok and then click ok again and now that error should disappear so if i click on f5 again this time we are getting a different error which means that we are making progress so now it says violation of primary or unique key constraint now what this error here means um is that you are trying to add a record that has a primary key that already exists in your table now if i select everything from my table select everything from users you will see that this id of 1 already exists so i cannot use it again so if i change it here if i put 2 instead and i try to execute this query now okay now the query has been executed you need to commit that transaction so click on transactions and commit or press f9 okay and if i try to read from my table again press f5 now you can see that we have successfully inserted a record into our table so let's do this one more time just to repeat what we have learned this time i'm going to say that the id of user is 3 and i will say that the username is mark zuck mark zuckerberg um he is i don't know 35 maybe okay so you say insert into and then the name of your table and then inside parentheses you specify the name of the field so id name age and then you say values and again inside these parentheses you specify the values for these fields so id is three it is an integer so we don't use quotation marks and then this here is a name and because this here is a var char which means a string you need to use single quotation marks and then age again 35 an integer so you don't need quotation marks okay so i'm going to select this query press f5 and then press f9 in order to commit this transaction or go to transaction and press commit if you um didn't already press f9 okay and now if i say select everything from users now we are going to get our third user so that is how you write sql queries so i believe that is enough for this video for your first time working with a database i am going to paste all the code and all the links that you need for this video in the description or i will pin it in a comment and then in the next video i'm going to show you how you can create a c plus app and connect it to the database so that you can read the data and write it store it in your database so that is going to be the next video and then please let me know in the comment section if you want an entire course related to sql so if you want to learn sql i can create that course if you want and um please give this video a thumbs up if you want more videos like this one and that also helps me and helps the youtube algorithm in order to promote this video to other people so that they can learn programming as well so if this video was helpful for you make sure to share it with someone who also needs to learn this or wants to learn programming so thank you very much for watching and i am going to see you in some other video bye
