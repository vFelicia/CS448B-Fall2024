hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is saldina and i make i.t and programming related videos so if that is something that is of interest to you consider subscribing to my channel and give this video a thumbs up as well now in this particular video i want to talk about objectoriented programming so what is objectoriented programming well oop or objectoriented programming allows you to represent reallife objects in programming and those reallife objects are going to be represented together with their attributes and then their behaviors as well one of the most important concepts of oop are classes and objects so let me explain the difference what is a class and then what is an object a class is going to represent a template meaning a blueprint and then an object really represents an example of that class an instance of that class for example a class can be a fruit and then an object of that fruit class can be an apple a banana a peach or another example a class can be a car and then an object of that class can be a volvo a ford bmw and so on and that car class for example has some attributes and then it has some behaviors as well now what are attributes of car class well a car has a name for example that's an example of one attribute and then it has a price and max speed and color and so on and then behaviors of a car can be drive for example and then break as well and then change color and so on so here we are going to create an example of a class and then we are going to create an object of that class so the class that i want to create is going to be called youtube channel so in order to create a class you write class and then you give a name to your class so here i'm going to say youtube channel like this and then you put these curly brackets and at the end you will have to put a semi column and now here you will put the members of this class now one thing that i haven't mentioned is that class is user defined data type we have already talked about data types in this course or in c plus plus for beginners course so if you haven't watched that make sure to do so i'm going to link it in the description and then here as well so we have talked about basic data types such as integer floating point number and then boolean character double string you know but a class is going to be a userdefined data type which is going to allow you to represent a reallife object in programming and in this particular situation i want to represent a youtube channel so let's think of attributes of a youtube channel what is something that describes a youtube channel let's say for example that each youtube channel has a name so that is going to be a string variable let's say string name like this so these attributes are going to be represented with variables so one of the attributes is going to be name and then let's say another is going to be string owner owner name like this and then let's think of another attribute let's say that each youtube channel has a subscribers count so end subscribers count like this and then let's as well create a list of published videos so i'm going to say list and let's call it published video titles so that is going to be type string and it is going to be called published like this now here it says that this list cannot be used because we haven't included um it here so here i'm going to say include list and now this should be accessible okay now we don't have that error anymore and what i want to do here is i want to represent a youtube channel that has four attributes it has a name then owner name you can use email here or whatever and then it has subscribers count and published video titles now here you can use another class here you can say for example list of videos you can create another class that is called video and then in that video class you can put all the attributes that describe a video so that can be for example a title and then a description number of likes number of comments number of views um the duration of that video the video itself you know but for the simplicity of this particular exam example i'm going to use just the title of those videos so now after i have created this youtube channel class what i can do is i can create an object of that class so let's say here that i'm going to create an object so how you do that you say the type so you put the name of your class which is youtube channel and then you give a name to that variable let's call it youtube channel like this okay now what i want to do is i want to assign values to these properties of my youtube channel and how do i do that well you say youtube channel and then you put dot and here is nothing available but it should be these properties should be available when you say youtube channel dot now why these are not available it is because all the members of your class are by default private and that means that these members because they are private they are going to be accessible only within this class here and in order to make them public in order to make them accessible outside of this class you put public access modifiers so you say here public okay like this now this public is an access modifier and it is going to make all of these members of your class accessible outside of your class which means that now if i press dot here as you can see name owner name published video titles and then subscribers count is available for me now so i'm going to say that the name of my youtube channel is going to be for example code beauty like this and then owner name let's copy this a couple more times so owner name is going to be my name so saldena like this and then subscribers count well let's say this is an integer variable so we don't need the quotation marks let's say a hundred and a thousand and eight hundred uh people and then these published video titles so let's add value to my published video titles list so here i want to say that i have published for example um c plus plus for beginners oh let's say video one okay and then let's say html and css video one okay and let's add as well this video so let's say c plus plus oop video one okay now after i have assigned value to these properties what i can do is i can write out these properties so i can say here for example c out and then let's say name and let's write out the name of my youtube channel like this and i'm going to add an end line and i'm going to copy this couple more times like this so here i want to write out owner name so let's put youtube channel dot owner name and then here i want to write out the subscribers count so youtube channel dot subscribers count and then published video titles now this property here published video titles is not a simple property meaning this property here is a list and in order to write out a list we are going to use a loop so i'm going to delete this and then here i want to create a loop and let's say that we will be using for each loop so i'm going to say 4 like this and then here i'm going to write out the type of the value that i'm going to use in my list so i'm going to say string because this published video title is of type string and then here i want to give it a name so i'm going to say video title like this and then i'm going to specify the list that i want to iterate and that list is going to be this one here so it is going to be a list of published videos in my youtube channel object okay and now in these curly brackets i am going to specify the block of code that is going to be executed in each iteration so what i want to do with this video title is i want to write it out so i'm going to say see out and then let's write out video title and i'm going to add an end line at the end as well and one more thing that i want to write out before this list is going to be just see out videos like this okay and let's add end line at the end so that it is for method nicely so now if i run this program as you can see it has written out information about this object that we have created here it says that the name of youtube channel is code beauty and then owner name is saldena subscribers count is equal to 1800 and then the this channel has published three videos so c plus for beginners and then html and css video one and then c plus plus object oriented programming video one okay so uh i have created a class that is called youtube channel i have created four attributes so four properties and made them public which means that these four properties are going to be accessible outside of this class and we have accessed those properties here so we have said uh that we want to assign the value to our name property and then own our name subscribe subscribers count and then we have as well um assigned value to this published video titles list okay and then here we have written out information that is stored inside these properties so that was an example of how you can create a class and then how you can create an object of that class as well and in my next video we are going to be talking about constructors and class methods because there is a more simple way to do this that we have done here so make sure to check that video out as well so i hope that you enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and also please subscribe to my channel and click that bell icon and i'm going to see you in my next video bye
