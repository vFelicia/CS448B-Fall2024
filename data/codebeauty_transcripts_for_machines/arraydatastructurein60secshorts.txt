in this video I'm explaining one of the data structures that every developer should know about an array array is type of collection that has fixed size and it stores elements one after the other in memory every element has an index so you can access each element by using the name of the array and the index of the element you can imagine an array as a garage that has fixed number of parking places let's say 10. they are all one after the other and each parking place has an index so you can Traverse the entire garage and find any car that you want very fast but adding more than 10 cars is impossible because the garage has fixed size and in order to add more cars you would have to buy a bigger garage and then move all of your existing cars there and then add new cars and this is very time consuming this is the main characteristic of array data structure traversing it and searching data inside an array is very fast but if you want to write a program that will often add new elements and remove existing elements then it is better to use a different data structure for example a linked list
