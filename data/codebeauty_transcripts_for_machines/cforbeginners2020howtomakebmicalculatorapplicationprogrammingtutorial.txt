hi guys water to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners I just got an idea of a simple and fun program that I can show you how you can build and since I'm a bit of a fitness enthusiast myself if you haven't noticed I wanted to show you how you can build your own body mass index calculator so stay tuned make sure to subscribe and let's build our own BMI calculator okay so here is the text of my task and what we are going to build is BMI calculator so first I want to explain what is BMI calculator it is body mass index calculator that is going to tell you whether you are underweight or a normal weight or you are overweight depending on your weight and your height and here I'm going to use weight in kilograms and then height in meters so if someone else wants to adjust this program so that he can work with pounds feet and inches you can write out that code in the comments down below and the first one that gets it right I'm going to pin that comment so that everyone else can use it and see it okay so we are going to use this formula here which is used calculating your BMI in metric system so another thing that I want to mention is does these three categories here there are also some more categories that you can really calculate whether you are extremely underweight or you are extremely overweight but these three should be enough for us to do now and these three I'm going to cover in this code another disclaimer that I want to make is that this BMI calculator probably should not be used by people that have huge amounts of muscles so professional bodybuilders because even though they have my soul that muscle is still weight so even though they are not overweight they will fall in a category of overweight because their BMI is going to be higher but for most of us that don't have a lot a lot a lot of muscle or are living normal lives trained couple of times a week maybe this is going to be completely okay so let's build our program now so here is our tool that we are going to use to draw this diagram so lucid chart and let's really develop the algorithm for solving this problem and we are going to translate that diagram that algorithm in C++ code so as you may already know first thing that I'm going to put here is this shape here that is going to indicate the start position of my program this circle shape here and after that we really need two things from our user so two things that he should enter and those are his height and his weight so let's use this funnel shape here that is going to indicate something entering in your program so visual representation that's why I'm using that panel shape and inside here I'm going to put two things that my user needs to enter and those two things are these two tanks here so he's weighed and he should enter his weight in kilograms and also he's height and let's say that he should enter his height in meters so I'm going to use metric system for this problem okay now let's indicate the flow of our program it should flow like this and after our user has entered his weight and his height there is a simple calculation that our program needs to perform and that calculation is going to be a process for our program so the shape that I'm going to use for that is this shape here so this shape that says process on it and what our program should process what our program should calculate is it should total eight BMI so I'm going to put here BMI is equal to and then I'm going to put this formula here that is used calculate BMI okay so it's weight represented eight kilograms divided by height to the power of two so I'm going to multiply my height with height okay and this is really the calculation of our BMI and now after our program has calculated this BMI what we are left to do is we should depending on this BMI really right out so our user whether he's underweight or overweight or of a normal weight so we should make a decision depending on this BMI and for that decision we are using this decision shape so this diamond shape and inside this diamond shape I'm going to put I'm going to put a condition and that condition is going to be let's first check whether my BMI is lower than eighteen point five like this and in this situation where our users BMI is lower than eighteen point five so when this condition here results as yes I am going to write out something to my user and lets me find a shape okay let's rotate the shape and delete is text okay and what I want to write out my user oh I can make this smaller what I want to write out to my user in the situation where his BMI is lower than eighteen point five is I want to write out that he is really underweight so let's put text inside here now let's write out that he is underweight so that is going to happen in this situation oh my god there's kind happen in this situation here let me just okay it's okay so in this situation where is BMI is lower than eighteen point five we are going to write out the t's underweight but in the situation where his BMI is not lower than eighteen point five we have to check something else and let's check so let's add another of these diamond shapes where is it here okay and let's now check whether his BMI is higher than 25 so I'm going to write out BMI greater than 25 okay and that is going to happen in the case that this here results as no and in the situation where users BMI is higher than 25 that really means that our user is overweight so we are going to write out Oh okay so we are really going to write out a message to our user so let's copy trip here which we are using to write out a message for a user so this reversed funnel shape that to represent something living your program something being outputted from your program so in the case where this calculation here results as true we are going to write out our user that he is overweight like this okay and let's really adjust this no it's that looks a bit more presentable okay so first we have checked whether his BMI is lower than eighteen point five it's yeah if yes we have written out underweight if no we have to check whether his BMI is greater than 25 and if it is it means that he's overweight but in the situation where this here results as a no that means that our users BMI is not lower than eighteen point five nor it is greater than 25 so that means that his BMI is really somewhere in between so between eighteen point five and twenty five and that is a normal BMI so that is our last possible situation where we are going to break out to a user that he has a normal weight so what's right out normal normal weight okay so after we have covered these three case it's cases let's just join our flows into one so I'm looking for this shape here and I'm going to make it smaller delete this text from it and I'm really just going to join these flows inside this shape here let's just try to move this here I'm going to delete it and let's say that I'm going to okay guys I had huge problems trying to adjust some arrows so I had to rewrite this whole diagram and I believe that I made it a bit prettier so here we were explaining that in the case that our user has BMI lower than eighteen point five we are going to write out this message to him in the case that his BMI is not lower than eighteen point five we are going to check whether it is greater than 25 and if yes we are going to write out that he's overweight if no we are going to write out that he's of normal weight and in each of these three cases we are coming here to this diamond shape here which is just got just going to join these three potential situations and after this diamond shape here we are going to write out our user what his BMI really is because I really want my user to know if he is for example in this situation here or in this situation here I want him to know whether his BMI is let's say eighteen point four so he is not that extremely underweight but he's just a little bit underweight or in this situation here I want him to know whether he's BMI is twenty five point five so he's just a little bit overweight or his BMI is really thirtyfive let's see that's why I I want to write out my BMI to my user his BMI to my user okay so and then we just really stop our program so now I'm going to copy this diagram and put it next to my visual studios to it we can really translate this this diagram here into our code so here I have put this diagram and then also my visual studio and let's now translate this diagram let's translate this algorithm into code because this here really is an algorithm explanation on how to solve a certain problem so the first thing that needs to happen is our user should enter he's weight and he's height and for ducked happen I first need to declare variables for weight and height and for that I'm going to use type float because his weight and height can be decimal point number so I'm going to say float and then I'm going to say weight and height okay like this and after that let's put a message out to our user so that he knows that he should enter his weight and height so I'm going to say C out weight and let's put that he should enter his weight in kilograms and that also height but he should enter his height in meters like this so that he knows which which system he should use okay after we have written out this message here what I need to do is I need to use my C in command so that I can allow my user to enter weight and height and I'm going to say first thing that my user enters that's going to be stored inside my weight variable and then after that the second value that my user actress is going to be my height so store that in a height variable like this okay and after we have entered weight and height next thing that needs to happen is we need to do this formula here and really calculate our BMI and in order to store this result the result of this expression in RB and why we need a variable for debt and that variable is obviously going to be called BMI so what's that here in this line here let's add BMI so I'm going to declare another variable and that variable I'm going to use now and I'm going to say that my BMI is going to be used as follows so I'm going to use this formula here which is our weight divided by our height to the power of 2 for now I'm going to use use it like this okay and this one here we have really calculated our BMI so this code here and now after we have calculated our BMI what we should do is we should really check what is the value of that be my and for that we are using the shape here which really translates into if ifelse case so first I'm going to say if and then the first thing that I want to check is if my users BMI is lower than eighteen point five like this and in this situation where his BMI is lower than eighteen point five I'm going to execute one line of code so that's why I don't need to put these brackets so I'm going to delete them because I just want to execute one line of code and that line of code is going to be indented here so that it's easier to read and that line of code is really to be going to be a message that I want to write out my user and that message is going to be that my user is underweight unfortunately okay now let's add one end line like this okay this is in the situation where his BMI is lower than eighteen point five in a situation where his BMI is not Lord in eighteen point five we're going to execute something else so that's something else we represent would else statement and I'm going to put that else statement and what is happening in that else case it is happening another ifelse so here we have a situation where we need to check something else so here I'm going to put else if so if this here results as no please then check something else and for that we use this else if statement so I'm going to say else if please check if my BMI is greater than 25 then so in that situation we also want to execute one line of code and that line of code is going to be to write out to my user that his BMI is greater than 25 which means that he is overweight so let me copy this message here and we are just going to adjust that so I'm just going to say you are overweight like this okay so if his BMI is less than eighteen point five I'm going to write out that he under weight else if his BMI is not lower than eighteen point five I'm going to check whether his BMI is greater than 25 if yes I'm going to write out that he's overweight if no we are also going to execute something else and that that is the situation here so in this case he has a normal weight so let me again copy this message here and let's really put here a normal weight like this okay so in this situation where his BMI is not great not lower than eighteen point five nor it's greater than 25 we are going to write out or user that he has a normal weight and with this here with this code here we have really covered this part of diagram here okay and then after this code here executes we really want to write out he our BMI to him to the user so we have to translate this shape here which really translates into our our see out command and we want to write out your BMI is and now let's write out BMI like this okay and this line of code as you may already see from our diagram is going to execute in either this case or this case or this case because after we have finished with this decision part we have executed only this part of code or this part of code or this part of code here so whichever of these three has been executed after this code here we are going to execute this line here in either this situation or the situation or this situation and that is going to be writing out to my user what his BMI really is and that is the last thing that we need to put so the last part of our code and now if I run my program okay it asks me to enter my weight and my height and my weight is I believe 6766 kilograms I think and then my height is 1.75 let's press Enter oh no I'm overweight how might be my 66 okay guys for a moment I thought that I am overweight but I am not definitely this 66 BMI overweight so that means that we have a bug so where are you sneaking a little buggy back well if you can see where our bug is then write that in comments down below and I already see where potentially our bug could be so this formula here it should really go like this so we should divide our weight with our height to the power of 2 which means that we should put parentheses here like this because and that is this calculation here so in this situation our weight is going to be divided with our height and after that that number is going to be multiplied with our height so we are going to get larger BMI that we should really so we should put this code here in parentheses so that was the first bug that really happened in these tutorials ok I'm going to leave this alright I'm not going to edit it out out okay and now if I enter my weight let's see 66 and then my height 1.75 okay so I am 21.5 that is my BMI and I am off a normal weight so we have really built our BMI calculator and this is the formula that you should use for a metric system and if someone else wants to rewrite this program for pounds and inches and feet you can write that in the comments down boy and as I said I'm going to pin that comment up so that everyone can see it if you of course get it right I hope you liked this video if you did make sure to write it in a comments down below and I'm going to put more videos like this and also subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon so that you are first to be notified when I publish a new video share this video with anyone who would like to learn programming or also with fitness people that would just like to use this program and if you don't know how you can run this program without using that using Visual Studio I'm going to link my first video here and at the end of that video I'm explaining how you can run the program from windows and that should give you an idea on how you can really share your applications with other people so make sure to subscribe like leave a comment share whatever you want and I'm going to see you in my next video bye
