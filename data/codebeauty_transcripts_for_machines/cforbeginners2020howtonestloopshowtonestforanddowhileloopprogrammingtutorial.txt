so this here is the initialization step of our installation initialization initialization initialization so it is the in this in hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners in this video I want to talk about nesting loops in my previous videos we have talked about while we do while loop and for loop and now I want to show you the example on how you can really combine and nest those loops so if you haven't watched my previous videos or you are not familiar with loops at all I recommend you to watch those I'm going to link those in the description of this video and also before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and click that Bell icon as well so what are we going to do in this video I want to really show you how you can nest for loop and dowhile loop and the example that I'm going to use to explain that is going to be following so I want my user which is going to be a student let's say to enter three grades or more if you want we are going to use three for this example and I want to do is grades I want those grades to be between one and five and that I want to write out the average grade so the average grade between those three that he has entered so let's start building our program the first thing that I need to explain is since we are going to enter 3 grades that means that we are going to repeat that entering process 3 times and for that I'm going to use for a loop so I'm going to write 4 and then in these parentheses here I'm going to put my initial setup of for loop which is going to be the first thing is going to be initial value of our counter so I'm going to declare a counter which is going to be called I and initially I'm going to give it a value of 0 that is the first thing the second thing that I need to put in these parentheses here is going to be the condition that our loop checks each time that it wants to run a block of code which is going to be this block of code that we put inside these parentheses so that condition we put here and that condition is going to be while our I is less than 3 so we want to make three iterations in first iteration RI has the value of 0 and the second iteration is going to have the value of 1 and then in our third iteration is going to have the value of 2 so we have made three iterations after that it gets the value of 3 but this condition here is not going to be true anymore so that our for loop is not going to be executed any more so that is the second thing and then the third thing which we need is going to be really increasing that value of our counter in each iteration so after each iteration and I'm going to put here this increment on our I variable okay so in this block of code here we are going to repeat 3 times something so what is that something that is going to be really the process of our user entering the value for his grade and since we said that that grade needs to be between 1 and 5 I am going to use dowhile loop for that how well I'm going to write out to do ok and then here I'm going to put while which is going to be the condition so here we prompt our user to enter the grade and then we say here you are going to have to enter that grade while that grade is less than 1 or greater than 5 so since we don't have any variable that we are going to use to enter that grade I will have to declare it here so I'm going to say here int rade like this okay and then let's prompt our user in this block here to enter his grade so I'm going to write out C out and let's say enter breed and I am going to use the current value of my counter so that I can really say which grade my user is entering so enter first grade second grade and third grade so I'm going to say I plus one like this y plus one well because our counter starts at zero and it wouldn't make much sense to say to our user please enter grade zero so that is why I'm increasing this value of my I when I want to write out a message to my user okay like this so here I'm going to write out please enter a grade and after that I need to accept that great that my user enters in my grade variable so I'm going to say C in grade like this and we are going to repeat this process here for a single read well our user enters a grade that is less than 1 or grade is greater than 5 okay so our program is really going to prompt our user please enter grade 1 and then he enters 6 for example and then our program checks this condition here and says ok you have missed this part here so go back and then please enter grade 1 so first grade again okay so if I run my program now let's just prove that very quickly so our program our program says now enter first grade so enter grade 1 and then let's say that I entered 9 for example it prompts me again to enter first grade because I have not obeyed this rule here sparked here so I'm going to say this time for example five and then it says okay you have successfully entered first grade let's now enter second grade so for that second grade let's enter for example 0 and then it prompts me again you have not entered correct value for grade please enter it again and let's say that this time I'm going to enter Y and then it asks for a third grade and let's say that this time third grade is going to be three so our program now has successfully accepted disturbed grade and now our program is going to really finish its execution because we haven't written anything else after this part here so there is something else that we need to write and since we want to calculate the average grade of our user what we are going to need is going to be really to sum all of these grades that our user enters so I am going to declare a variable which is going to really hold that some of our users grade so I am going to put it here I'm going to call it sum and initially I'm going to assign it a value of zero and later I'm going to explain why so I have declared a variable that is going to be of type int and I have called it sum and assigned a value of zero so this sum here is going to each time that our user enters a grade and we really we really check that that grade is valid grade after that we want our son to hold whatever it was previously holding plus the value of our grade like this okay so why I have assigned a value of zero to my son because zero is a neutral value when it comes to adding numbers you add 0 to whichever number and then you get that same number and in a situation where we didn't assign any value to our sum we would get really an error so if I try to run my program now you see that it prompts me with an error and it says an initialized local variable some use because it does not have any value assigned to this variable here it is going to say really that it does not know how to add the value so the value of our grade to our sum so that is why we need to assign some value to our some variable okay so and that value is going to be zero because zero is neutral when it comes to adding numbers okay so now I can really run my program and as you can see that error has disappeared so I'm going to stop my program and let's very quickly write out this sum that we have calculated here so I'm going to say C out and I reach write out some like this sum is equal to and then let's write out the value of our song and let's add my like this so I am going to run my program once more it prompts me to enter first grade I'm going to say that my first grade is going to be for example five and then my second grade is going to be for example six that's an error so please enter your second grade again so I'm going to enter this time to let's say and then for my third gear third grade let's enter one for example and it says that the sum of my great grades is equal to eight which is correct so one plus two plus five that is going to equal to eight so what we are left to do now we should only really divide our sum by the count of our grades which is three because we have hardcoded this value here the tree so our user can enter only three grades you can really use a variable for this or you can part code it to any other value that you want and need so here after this line of code here what I need to do is following so I'm going to say C out and then let's say average is equal to let's say average grade is equal to and let's write out the results so that is going to be sum divided by three okay is it though so I need to run my program and let's enter for example value 2 and then again value 2 and then let's enter for example value 4 and then it says that average grade is equal to 2 which is not correct but why has this happened so as you can see here we have used two integer variables so our sum is integer value and then 3 is integer value as well so when you divide two integer values the result is also going to be integer value so in order to get a floating point a decimal point number you really need to convert one of these two into a float type so you can say either here you can say float so please convert my some variable into float and then divide or you can put here this point 0 or you can leave both of these whichever you prefer so I'm going to leave both of these like this so if I run my program once more it prompts me again to enter first grade so I'm going to say that my first grade is equal to 5 and then my second grade is also 5 and then let's say that third grade of our user is going to be 9 so our program prompts us again to enter the third grade because it needs to be in this interval here so I'm going to say now that the value of my third grade is going to be 3 which is correct value and after that as you can see it writes out that the sum of these 3 grades is 13 and then average grade is 4 point 3 3 3 3 3 so that was an example on how you can really combine and nest loops in order to solve complex problems I am going to paste the text of this program here in the description of this video so if you need it you can find it there and thanks for watching make sure to subscribe to my channel if like the Bell I can also share it with anyone who would like to learn programming and I'm going to see you in my next video bye
