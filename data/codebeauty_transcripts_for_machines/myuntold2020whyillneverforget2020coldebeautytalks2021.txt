so 2020 was a year of finding myself in the midst of pandemic and all the unfortunate events that came with it i decided to open a youtube channel seeing people losing their jobs and students not being able to go to schools and knowing that all of them will be looking for some sort of knowledge that will give them a promise of a better future a work that they can do from their home and knowing that i can do something to help that gave me a strong sense of purpose and it gave a meaning to all the free time that i had on that journey i have personally learned so much and when i look back at my first video i think to myself oh god i would do this so much better now i was so shy and i was forgetting every second word but you know what it is important to start and seeing the difference from a few months ago and now is what makes me realize that i have made progress myself and that i have learned so much from you i know that a lot of you who are watching my channel are struggling with programming i know that feeling when a programming problem gives you a headache when you don't feel smart enough or you feel like giving up i have been there i've experienced it as well i still do and i'm sharing this because i want you to see that side of me as well i want you to see that i am someone that you can relate to more than you think and the best advice that i can give you is to be kind to yourself to understand that there is a learning curve and that it is normal to struggle and don't forget about the people that your code affects it's sometimes easy to see just numbers and letters and code but when you consider the impact that your application is making on the life of each person who is using it that gives you a sense of purpose which is much greater than just writing code sitting in front of a camera and talking to 10 000 people for someone who is a programmer who is introverted by nature it's not easy but i do it for you reading all the nice comments and seeing that people actually like my videos is what makes me going so thank you for that thank you for every like and share and comment and i appreciate so much each one of you who are subscribed to my channel and who watch my videos you guys have given me the voice and the opportunity to speak and stand up for the things that i believe in i managed to raise interest for programming among young kids in my country giving them the opportunity to learn things that will help them to have a better future tomorrow encouraging more girls to enter this industry because it doesn't really matter your gender your race age the way you look those things don't really matter as long as you are using your knowledge to help others and do something meaningful with it the world will appreciate it and you will feel happy and that is the only thing that truly matters speaking at un anniversary event about global issues that we all should care for like poverty in some countries inequality children that don't have opportunity for education discrimination global warming and pollution you have given me the voice to speak about all of this publicly and i will always stand up for the things that i believe in peace justice and equality and this channel will always be a place to share the knowledge and educate people i know that 2020 has been a very difficult year for many people i know that a lot of people lost their jobs or lost a dear one and it has been hard for me it has forced me to think about the true meaning of happiness what am i doing with my life am i really using my knowledge to help others starting this youtube channel was a very big step outside of my comfort zone but sitting here in front of you and looking back at all the things that we have done together i can truly say that i have never been happier in my life and this video is a thank you to all of you because you are my inspiration
