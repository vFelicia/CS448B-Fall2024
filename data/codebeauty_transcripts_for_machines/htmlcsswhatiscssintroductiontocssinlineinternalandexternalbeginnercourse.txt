hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of HTML and CSS for beginners in this video I want to talk about CSS in my previous video I have explained basics of HTML and in this one I want to cover the basics of CSS so we are going to talk about different types of CSS and we are going to talk about CSS in general so before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and also click the bell icon so that you are notified when I publish my next video and also follow me on my other social media platforms the link for that is going to be in the description of the video so without further ado let's start with today's lesson the first thing that I want to explain is going to be what is CSS CSS stands for cascading style sheets and that really means that CSS is used in order to style your HTML document so in order to style your web page and for that we are going to use it and I really wanted to make this course both HTML and CSS because these two are used really together so not separately but you use HTML in order to define the structure of your web page so all the elements that are going to appear in your web page and then CSS is really going to be styling those elements so here I have this basic HTML structure I hope that you are familiar with this if you are not you can watch my previous video there I have explained this basic HTML structure so I'm going to start from there and we are going to add a couple of elements the first one that I want to add is going to be title so let's say title ok and here I'm going to use let's say my first page like this so I'm going to say that this is my first web page and I have saved it and now if I click reload here as you can see my first page has appeared as this top title so that has done this title tag now I want to add headings so for that we are using this h1 tag and I'm going to say this is heading like this and also I have saved that so control us in order to save all the changes when you get this black dot symbol so control s and the changes are saved and then you can refresh it in your browser and your tag is going to appear so this is heading has appeared in my web browser okay so let's add one more element and that is going to be a paragraph and inside it I want to add let's say I want to write this is paragraph okay and then let's add a couple more sentences so I'm going to say this is second line and add a break line as well and then let's add a third line so that it really looks like a real paragraph so this is second one and then this is third third line okay and I'm going to add the end of sentence so now if i refresh it you can see that our paragraph has appeared here as well so now what I want to do is I want to style these elements here and the first type of CSS that I'm going to show you is going to be inline CSS because there are multiple ways that you can write your CSS the first one is going to be in Y after that I'm going to show you internal CSS and then I'm going to show you external CSS which is used most often so my CSS is going to be really to write your style in the tag so in the in this element itself on it start that you put style attribute and then in these quotation marks you can put really the property that you want to style and then its value and as you can see here we are offered with multiple properties that properties that we can style for this h1 tag and the one that I want to use is going to be for example color like this and then after I've specified the property name itself I'm going to really write the color that I want this text to be off so I'm going to use for example hot pink color okay and now if I save this and then refresh my web browser page here you can see that this heading has become of this hot pink color okay so that is one thing that I want to show you and then what style this paragraph text as well so this paragraph element I want to style differently so I want to say for example that for my paragraph tag I want to style background color so this property here and for that let's use green let's say this green yellow color and here you can really specify the name of your color or you can put this RGB value meaning red green and blue and you can as well put here hexadecimal code of your color and for now we are going to use only this green yellow name of a color so if I save that and then refresh my page you can see that this here has become of this greenish color that we have specified here okay so that would be really styling these elements in lines so this is called inline CSS because we specified that CSS in this element itself so in this start tag of an element and now I want to show you another way of writing CSS and that is going to be really writing internal CSS so what is internal CSS that means that you can put your CSS so your style in this head section in this style text so I'm going to write style and then here so between the start tag and instead I'm going to put the name of my element and that is going to be for example this P tag so I want to style my paragraph and then in these curly brackets we are going to specify the style for this P tag and this style is going to be applied on all paragraph tags that we have in this HTML document so here I'm going to say for example that I want to style the font size of this P element and I'm going to say that that font size should be for example 20 pixels okay and after I have saved it I can refresh it and as you can see this paragraph now has this size of 20 pixels and this here is going to be applied on all paragraph tags in my HTML document so in this body section and just to prove that I'm going to add another paragraph and I'm going to say P and let's say this is second paragraph like this okay also I have saved it and now if i refresh it you can see that my second paragraph has appeared and it has the same font size as this one here but it does not have this green yellow background color because we have specified this inline CSS only on this first paragraph and that's why only this first paragraph has this greenish background but this one does not have any background at all so for that I'm going to move this background color from this my CSS into this internal CSS so I'm going to copy that control C and then placed it here and now if I save it and reload my page once more you can see that this paragraph two has gotten this green yellow background color and that means that now we can really remove this inline CSS from our first paragraph and this should behave the same when I save it and reload it it has stayed the same okay and let's move this h1 element into this internal CSS as well so here I'm going to say h1 and then put these curly brackets which means in these curly brackets I'm going to specify the style for all h1 elements on my webpage so let's say for example that I want style background color as well and for this background color I'm going to choose well this lavender blush color let's say for example because that's apparently a color so if I save it and then reload it here you can see that our heading has gotten this pink not not pink but this lavender blush background color I'm sorry guys I should probably use normal colors okay so we have styled it with this lavender blush color and let's also add it another property so let's say that we want to style the color itself so for this color I'm going to use for example red okay and now if I save this document and try to reload it here what do you expect that is going to happen well I did in a comments down below so if I reload it you can see that nothing has changed and why has that happened why Notting has changed because as you can see here we have specified red color but here we have still this hot pink color as the color for this heading and this this my CSS really has priority over this internal CSS because any time that you specify inline CSS for your element that is going to be really of a higher priority than your internal CSS so the priorities of these types of CSS go in a following way so the biggest priority has this in my CSS after dad the priority has this internal CSS so whatever you put in these style tags and then though these priority has external CSS but that is the one that is most used most so if I delete this my CSS now I'm going to save my document and then I'm going to reload my page and then as you can see our heading has become of this red color that we have specified here so now we have really removed all the styling from this my CSS to this internal CSS and this internal CSS is one way to style your page as well but neither the inline CSS nor the internal CSS are used that often and the one that is used most is going to be external CSS but why what is your reason well if you remember when we had that style for our paragraph tag here so inline style for this paragraph if you can remember that that was not really applied on any other paragraph tag but this one here okay so we have changed that when we moved that paragraph style to our internal CSS so with this with this code here we have said please style all my paragraph tags in this page but when you build a website you usually have your website consisting of more than one page and usually I want to apply the same styling for all of those pages and that is why external CSS is used meaning that you create a different file for your style and then you apply that file on all the HTML pages so on all the web pages that your site consists of and now I'm going to show you how you can create external CSS so I'm going to say file and then new file and here I have been presented with this untitled empty document so I'm going to save it ctrl s and I'm going to save it on my desktop so the same location where my where this my first webpage HTML document is that is very important so I'm going to name it style and the extension that you use for CSS files is going to be dot C SS okay so when I say that you can see that now it really looks different than it did before so it has this dot CSS extension and then here you can really move all of this internal CSS so I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to paste it here and now I can delete this style tag from my head section so I'm going to delete that and I'm going to save my document and now if I try to refresh this page you can see that all of my styling has disappeared and why is that happened well as we deleted that Styles tag from this head tag so from this page we have really deleted all the Styles we have moved them to a different file which is this one here and I'm going to save that file and in order to have those styles so these Styles here applied to your HTML page you really have to link this file to this HTML page so you have to say please use styles from a separate file which is going to be this one here and in order to do that we use link tag which is this one here and we have to specify two attributes to our link tag the first one is going to be this relationship attribute so you say arielle and then if you hover over it it says this attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current to the current document okay so this attribute here is going to specify the relationship of this style CSS file to my HTML page and that relationship is style sheet like this okay so this Styles dot CSS is a style sheet for this web page and then the second attribute that you have to specify is going to be the location so where is this house dot CSS file and that is going to be really using H ref attribute like this and since this file here and this file here both have the same location so both of these files are on C users celina desktop and this one as well so C user selina desktop you can really specify just the name of the Styles file so you can see style dot CSS okay and now if I see these changes and refresh my webpage as you can see all these Styles appeared again so now we have again these styles that we have specified externally so in the external file and we have linked that file using this linked link tag and now we have really styled our web page using external CSS and now if you had multiple plate pages you can really just link this file the styles that CSS file to multiple pages and all of them are going to have a similar theme similar style one more thing that I want to show you is what is going to happen if I move for example this style dot CSS file so here we have specified only the name of our style file and that is because both of these files so both this HTML document and this CSS document are on the same location so that is this one here so disk c users so Deena desktop and then this one here is as well on disk C users sadena and then desktop and because of that we could only specify the name of our Styles file which is style dot CSS but what is going to happen if I for example move this file so what is going to happen if I create a new folder which I'm going to call let's say Styles okay and then I take this style dot CSS file which is this one here so this one that we have written here and linked here I take it and move it in my Styles folder so let's try to open this page again so I'm going to just reload it and as you can see we have lost our Styles again and why has that happened well because this style dot CSS is not available anymore on this location and this is the location where your HTML page is going to try to look for this file but since the location destination folder of this style dot CSS file has changed we have to really specify a new path to this file and let's check that path so I'm going to open this folder which I have created and then I'm going to right click on my style dot CSS and then click properties and here I have the location to my style file and that is going to be C users salvina desktop and then this Styles folder as well okay and then as you can see here it is going to look for this style dot CSS on C user solving a desktop which means that we are missing this part of pad here so this Styles folder so in order to fix the problem that we have we have to really specify that part of a pet here so I'm going to write styles and then put this flash so please try to look for this style CSS on this path and then add this Styles folder as well and then this is the name of the file that you are going to include so after I have saved it if I try to reload my page again you can see that my Styles have reappeared okay so I hope that you understood what is CSS and that you understood different types of CSS so we have talked about inline CSS internal and external CSS and the external CSS is this one here and that is the one that is used most often even though it is not wrong to use inline or internal CSS and we probably will sometime use the my CSS sometimes use the internal and external CSS as well so it really depends on what you need so it depends on your needs whether you want style a single tag in that case you can use inline CSS if you want to style all the page so a single page you can use internal CSS and then if you have multiple pages that you want to style you can use this external CSS and that often the case in in real life so you often have a website that consists of multiple pages so I hope that you enjoyed
