and then you can doubleclick on this visual code installer file and here you are going to be presented with this license agreement so you can click I accept the agreement and you can read these terms and conditions if you want I usually don't I'm sorry guys I probably should now that I'm filming yet but it's just no it's too long no hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to the first video of HTML and CSS for beginners in this course I want to teach you how you can build your own website or a website for someone else and if you're interested in this topic make sure to subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon as well because I am going to publish more videos on this topic and also follow me on my other social media platforms the link is going to be in the description of this video and the first thing that I want to show you in this video is going to be the tool that we are going to be using in order to write our HTML and CSS code so that tool can really be as simple as notepad so any text editor really so you can use notepad or notepad plus plus okay but the one that we are going to be using is called Visual Studio code so I am going to show you how you can download that so you type Visual Studio code and then this code dot Visual Studio com is going to be your link so you click here okay and now you really want to click on this download button and here you are going to be presented with the different versions of your Visual Studio code depending on the operating system that you use for me it is going to be windows so you click on this windows downloader and soon your download should start depending on your internet connection for me it is a bit slower ok and as you can see my download has started but I am going to really cancel it since I have downloaded this Visual Studio code version for Windows and I have it here on my desktop okay and it is really a simple next next finish installation so when you doubleclick on that you are going to be presented with this license agreement so terms and conditions so you can click on this I accept the agreement and then you can click Next and here you are going to be presented with this where should Visual Studio could be installed I usually leave this as it is already so by default I'm going to click Next as well ok and that it is asking for the program strike that I also click Next there so you can really leave these as they already are so defaults and then you can click install and this can take a couple of seconds for me at least ok and now this installation has been finished and it says that it wants to launch Visual Studio coach I'm going to click finish and as you can see this Visual Studio code has been really launched by default and the first thing that I want to do is going to be to change this dark theme into a light one you can skip this step but if you want to change the theme you can use this file and the Preferences and here you can select color theme and the one that I like is going to be this light Visual Studio Team so when you click on that we are presented with this beautiful light team ok so here I'm going to select new file since we want to create a new web page you can click on this new file and as you can see we are presented with this untitled empty file and I want to really zoom this in so that it is a bit more readable to you like this ok and now I'm going to save this file and then we are going to try to run it in our web browser just to see how this is really presented in our web browser so how you can save this file you can click on file and then here you have options to save and save as or you can use ctrl s or ctrl shift s so you can say ctrl s and I'm going to save this document on my desktop and I'm going to name it let's say my first web page and the extension that we need to use in order to say that this is HTML document so in order to tell to our computer that this should be opened by a web browser that extension is going to be dot HTML or just dot HTM whichever one you prefer I'm going to use this dot HTML extension like this ok and now I'm going to click Save and as you can see this file here is this location so this is the path to our my first web page dot HTML file so it is on disk C users folder than my user and then on desktop and then my first web page is the name of our file and that file is the what this one here so in my case it has been recognized by default to be opened by Google Chrome if that is not your case you can right click on it and then you can click open with and here you can select your preferred browser for me it is Google Chrome not sponsored so here I have opened this file in Google Chrome and as you can see this is the path to our file and then here is my first web page dot HTML which is really the name of our file and this file is empty so this web page is empty for now but we are going to add elements to our HTML document and then we are going to check how that is going to be shown in our browser the first thing that I want to explain is what is HTML HTML stands for hypertext markup language meaning that it is a standard language to create HTML documents or web pages and hTML is really used in order to create the structure of a web page which means that it is used to describe what elements are going to show up on your page and the example of those elements are a paragraph of text heading an image a link etc and we are going to see a lot more elements later in this course and in this video as well we're going to see some and then that HTML document is taken by your web browser and those tags are interpreted and then what browsers are really based on those tags decides which elements it needs to show to your user ok so here I want to show you the basic structure of an HTML document so I'm going to copy that okay this here is the basic structure of an HTML document and this line of code here so this doctype HTML really tells your computer that this is an html5 document and then here you have a root tag so I'm going to collapse it and here you have this HTML tag and this tab consists of this start tag and then this end tag and whatever content this tag has you are going to put that content between these two so between this start tag and this end tag and this is the root tag of your HTML page the content of this tag are two sections so two other tags and that is hash tag and then body tag so what is this head section what is this body section well here in this head tag you put data about your page meaning metadata and the examples of this are going to be for example title of your page some data about your author and then later when we learn more about CSS we are going to see how you can really style your body section so how you can style your HTML page by linking your CSS inside this head section but for now we are going to keep it simple ok so that is this tag you can collapse it as well and then inside this body section you put all the elements that you want to show to your user so the elements that I previously mentioned such as paragraph of text a link to to to another site an image heading except et cetera okay so these two are two tabs that you put inside your HTML tag and this HTML tag is root tag of your HTML page okay so I'm going to save this here now and if I try to run it in my web browser so I have already this web browser opened you can just refresh it if you have previously saved your HTML HTML document which we did so if I make some change you can see that this this black dot appears and then you can click ctrl as in order to save it and then you can come back to this document here and you can really refresh it and as you can see nothing has changed so we have put only this basic structure where is it so we have put only this basic structure of our HTML document and now we want to put elements so we want to put other tags in order to be interpreted by our web browser and then shown to our user ok the first element the first tag that I want to show you is going to be very simple one and let's say that for example that is going to be title tag so I'm going to write here in this head section so since that is something that we put in this head section that title tag I'm going to write here title ok and then I'm going to close that tag and the visual studio code does that for me if you use for example note that it wouldn't do that for you so it wouldn't write this close tag itself so you should probably either use you use something like visual studio code or you are going to have to really write these close tags on your own so this here is going the title of our webpage and I'm going to show you what is that title so how is it show let me just write this title so let's say that it is going to be my first web page like this and I'm going to save it and now if I come to this browser window so where we really test our code that's our web page and i refresh it make sure to watch this part here so I'm going to refresh it and as you can see my first web page has appeared here okay so that is what our title tag has done so this tab now is named my first web page okay so that really is this title tag and that goes inside this head section and then inside this body section we are going to put some other element and let's say for example that I want to add heading to my web page I'm going to minimize this and I'm going to put it here like this okay and let's say that we want to add heading to my web page so I'm going to use a tag that is usually used for that and that is going to be h1 tag meaning heading 1 and here I'm going to write let's see this is first heading like this Oh first okay and these H tags there is really six of these if I save this and then i refresh my page you can see that this is first heading has appeared on my page and as I already said there is six of these so you can use really H 1 H 2 H 3 4 5 & 6 in order to put different levels of heading to your web page so you can copy this and paste it multiple times like this and then we are going to change this to be h2 and then h3 h4 h5 and then h6 just see how that is going to be shown in our webpage and I have to change these and tags as well so this is opened as h2 and it has to be closed as h2 as well so h3 h4 h5 and then h6 okay and then if I save this and now I try to refresh it let me let me just try to position both of these in a single window and then I made position this okay here and now we are going to be able to really look at both of these at the same time so now if i refresh this window here you can see that we have six different levels of this heading and this is the biggest one and the most important one and then this is this is less important than this one and then this one is the least important okay so for now I'm going to leave only this h1 heading but I just wanted to show you that there are also more options okay so I'm going to delete that and then save it and here I'm going to refresh this page of ours and as you can see we are left but this is first heading and let's say that now we want to add a paragraph of text okay and for that I'm going to use something called lorem ipsum so it is this page here okay and here you really have some dummy text that you can use for these purpose purposes so I'm going to copy this I'm going to copy this paragraph of text here okay and let's say that I want to paste that text here inside my own paragraph and the tag that we use in order to put a paragraph of text in our HTML document so in our web page is going to be P tag like this and as well we have this open so this start tag and then this end tag and in between these two we put the content of this element so here I'm going to paste this text and as you can see it has been pasted all in a single line we are going to correct that but first I want to save it and see how my web browser is going to really show this here since in our editor it is all in a single line okay and now if i refresh this here as you can see it is not in a single line but it has been really shown in four lines so what if I try to add empty spaces here or new lines so let's find appropriate great places to add new lines let's say that it is going to be here okay and then let's say that we can put new line here as well and then also here okay so now if I say this these new lines should start with these words so with these sentences if our browser is to show it this way that we have written it here okay so I'm going to refresh it and as you can see it has not really changed in our web browser but why has that happened it has happened because it really does not matter how many empty spaces or new lines you put here so in this document here your browser is still going to really run their desk the same and if you need to put a new line you are going to use tag for that and the tag that is used in order to break line in order to put a new line is going to be the art tag so here I'm going to put BR like this okay and then this tag is used in order to put a new line to your web page so if I save this document now I'm going to save it and then I'm going to try to refresh it as you can see now my first line in my web browser is only this text here so it really contains only this sentence until it comes to this to this br tag okay and as you can notice this br tag really is different than these other tags so it is different than this P tag in the body and had a title as well because this tag really does not contain a start tag and an end tag but it is just br tag okay and that is because this tag does not contain any content so it is just used in order to break line in order to put a new line so whatever you put after this br tag is going to be placed in a new line and that is this sentence here so let's add another br tag here okay so I'm going to paste another be right back here and then here as well and if I save it now and I try to refresh it you can see that my text now has really been broken in a couple of sentences so here we have put one br tag and then here we have put another and here the third one and then this rest of the text has been really responsive li shown meaning that it is really going to adapt to the size of your web browser window okay but at the end we have these three be ours that we have put in our HTML document okay so I'm going to put it again here okay and that is going to be the example of a P tag and I'm going to finish this video here and then in my next video I'm going to show you really how you can style this web page or any other web page I'm going to talk more about CSS so that we are really learning about HTML and CSS together because they are usually used together so not not independently but CSS and HTML are used combined in order to really have a complete web page that has all the that you want to have on it and that looks nice as well so for now I hope that you have understood what is HTML how is it used and also this basic structure of your HTML document so this head and body sections and then we have learned how we can put a title and then how we can put this paragraph of text to our web page and in my next video we are going to talk more about CSS so make sure to watch that video and also subscribe to my channel so that you are notified when I publish that video and thanks for watching I'm going to see you in my next video bye
