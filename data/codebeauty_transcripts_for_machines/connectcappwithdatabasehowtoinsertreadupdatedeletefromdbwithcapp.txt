hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video i'm going to teach you how you can create c plus plus user interface application and connect it to a database so that you can read and write data from that database for that we are going to use interbase db that is going to be our database and then for building user interface applications we are going to use c plus builder the links to download these two are going to be in the description so if you are not familiar with either one of these two make sure to watch these two videos so the first one is going to teach you how you can install and set up interface db as well as how you can write your first sql queries and then the second one is going to teach you how you can build user interface applications with c plus and after you watch these two videos you should be able to follow this tutorial without any problems so with that being said now i'm going to show you the application that we are going to build in this video so here is the application that we are going to build its university app that contains the list of all the students for now we have only two students that i have inserted into my database so this data is read from the database and we have salina nurak and elon musk so let's now see how we can add more records more students so just click on this plus symbol and here you need to specify the id of the student and then name let's say bill gates and then grade is going to be six because from what i've heard he wasn't such a great student okay and then age is 60 and confirm this transaction okay and then let's also change some data let's say elon musk like this and confirm that and i'm going to delete myself it hurts but i am going to do it okay so delete record yes so now if i stop this application and then run it again we should be able to see these changes and as you can see indeed these changes have been stored in the database so now that i started my application now they have been read again so now i have only two students and i am not a student anymore okay so how are we going to approach building this application well the first step is going to be to create a database for this app so here i have opened interbase console so make sure to open your ib console and if you don't have it if you don't know how to install or set up interbase make sure to watch this video it will be linked here and also in the description so let's create our database here i have my local server and then here should be the list of databases i don't have any at the moment so i'm going to right click on databases and then create database so here i'm going to specify the name for my database and here i will select the location for my database documents folder is okay so i will say university db like this and click save and that is all that we need to do for now so i'm going to click ok and here is asking for username and password let me check what is the default password for interface very quickly and i'm going to put it on the screen okay so on the screen you can see default username and password master key and click connect and oh it says unable to connect to requested host now the problem is that our server is not running so make sure to start your interbase manager here i have it and you need to start the server here okay and then i'm going to close this error and if i try to connect to my database again now you should see this little green check mark and that means that you successfully connected to your database so after we have done this let's create the table where we are going to store our students so let's write an sql query so you can click here on this little sql icon and it is going to open a window like this one where you can write sql queries okay so here we are going to write sql code in order to create students table so i'm going to paste the query and i'm also going to leave it in the description so that you can copy it and paste it in your program and then if you want a separate sql course let me know in the comments give this video a thumbs up so that i know and i'm going to create a separate entire course related to sql only so here is our sql code to create a student's table so you say create table and then you put the name for your table which is students and then inside these parentheses like this you put all of the attributes and at the end you need to put this semicolon sign so these are the attributes of students so here you can see that every student has id name grade age and then here is something called primary key so let's explain these very quickly so name is of type var chart 30. this means that name is a string that has 30 characters that is max limit and then you can put here 50 or 80 or 100 if you need more characters and then this name should not be null okay and then grade is of typed integer and it also must not be null ages of type in and also it should not be null and then this id here it is also of type int it will not be null and it is also specified as primary key now what this part here means is that id is going to be a unique way to identify every single student so there cannot be two students that have the same id and we are going to use that id as a primary key for every student okay so here is sqlcode in order to create students table and i will leave this code in the description of the video or i will pin it in the comments so that you can use it and please make sure that you type everything correctly because the code that you write here sql code the errors that you make are much harder to fix and find than the errors in c plus plus code or any other programming language especially if you are a beginner okay um another very important thing is that sql language is not case sensitive which means that you can also say here create with capital letters it is going to work the same but please make sure to pick either lowercase or uppercase and then be consistent with that so i'm going to use lowercase i will say create with lowercase letters like this so how can i execute this query well you select the query that you want to execute and then you click on this thunder icon which says execute query or you press f5 on your keyboard and this query has been executed now we should see this table created here on these tables and views but it didn't appear i don't know why it's that but in order to refresh it i'm just going to close this very quickly and then i'm going to open it again and it is refreshed and here is our students table and all the fields that we created now there is probably more sophisticated way in order to fix this refreshing problem but if you're lazy like me just close it and open it again okay so the next step is to add a few records into our students table so let's do that let's say insert into students and then here i'm going to specify all the fields of students table so id name grade and age and then here i will specify the values okay so id is going to be one and then name i'm going to put it inside quotation marks single quotation marks because it is a string so let's say that the name will be salvina okay that's my name and then grade will be 9.5 that was my grade actually after finishing university and then age is 27. okay so in order to execute this query again i'm going to select it and i'll press f5 on my keyboard and here we get an error now a 10 attempt that updates during readonly transaction now if you get an error like this one let me show you how you can fix it so click here on transactions and then options and here you need to set right as access mode and click ok and okay here as well so if i try to execute this insert command again now we should get a message like this one okay and in order to commit this that transaction that we just made go to transactions and commit or press f9 on your keyboard okay great so with this we have successfully added one record into our students database so let's check that let's say select all from students okay and let's execute this command here and here we get every record from our students database and you can as you can see we have only one for now okay and here is the grade 10. now why is that the case let me know in the comments please before you listen to my answer so why do we have a grade of 10 here and here we have specified 9.5 so the answer is because we said that grade is going to be of type in so it is rounding this float type 9.5 to an integer number which is 10 in this situation so that is the reason okay now let's add another student let's say here for example elon musk okay and i'm going to put eight and then he is i believe around 50 years old okay so let's execute this press f5 okay and now we get an error very important error which says violation of primary or unique key constraint on table students now this error here means that we are trying to add a record into our students table that has the same primary key that already exists inside our students table so that is because if i select everything from students you can see that this id of one already exists for student salvina norak so in this situation we need to change the id as well for the second student so i'm going to change it to two and now i'm going to execute the query again and now if i oh first i need to commit the transaction okay and then i need to select everything from students and as you can see here we have the second record so that is how you can insert data into the database and read from the database using the ib console and now we are going to create c plus application and connect to this database in order to read and write the data from our c plus app so here i have opened c plus builder so let's create a new multidevice application with c plus plus it's going to be blank application click ok and now it is creating our project let's wait a couple of seconds so here is our blank application now before we start building this uh c plus app and connecting it to database there are some prerequisites some basic knowledge that you need to have in order to be able to connect a c plus plus app with a database so let's look at these tabs here so projects data explorer and then multidevice preview i want to focus on this second data explorer at least for now so i'm going to open it and if you look inside you will notice that here we have fire deck and db express so what i want to talk about is this fire deck part so what is fire dac it is a data access helper so it contains many different tools that are going to help us to connect to our database and to read the data write the data execute queries and things like that so if i open this fire dac you will notice that here we have many different databases and the one that i'm going to use is called interbase it is here so if i open interbase here you get something called employee now before you do anything please don't delete this because we are going to need it so this employee here this is actually a connection to our database so we are going to use this in order to connect to our database so how can you connect to the database that we just created so right click on this employee and click on modify okay and here you need to select the database okay and i'm going to select this one university db that we just created a couple of minutes ago and click open okay here is your username password protocol is tcp ip i'm going to change it to local because that is the default one okay and everything else i'm going to leave it as already is so i'm going to click on ok and now you should be able to connect to your employee database but if you're experiencing a problem and if you're not able to see the tables from your database one thing that i'm going to give you as a tip is to right click on your employee again click on modify and then here for server you are going to put the text that i'm going to put on the screen here so put localhost backslash gds underscore db if it is not working without this please try this um quick fix i'm going to delete it because for me it is working without it and click ok and now you should be able to see your student table that you created for this database also please make sure that your interface server is running so open your interface manager and make sure that your server is not stopped that is an important part as well so with that we have successfully connected to our database and now we can start working with the data inside this students table that we created now this part is going to be very easy that is why i love c plus builder so much so just drag and drop your connection this employee connection to your application and then go on this object inspector so select your connection go on object inspector and click connected to true okay so you need to set your connected state to true that is going to be the first step and then the second step is you need to drag and drop the table that you want to work with we have only one table for now that is our students table so i'm going to drop it on my application here and i also need to change its active state to true and then let's see how we are going to show the data from this students table so i'm going to use a grid i will say the string grid okay and i will just drag and drop this control to my application and just make it a little bit bigger here okay so how can you connect this grid in order to show the data from your students table it's actually very easy so right click on this grid and click on this bind visually and here you should see this live bindings designer so here is your students table and here is your string grid and in order to bind these two you just need to do this okay it's actually very easy and immediately you get this live binding preview of the data from your student table as you can see here and if i run my application let's see i should be able to see the data from my table was it taking so long okay so here is the table and here is the data from that table salina elon musk okay now another thing that i promised to show you is how you can add new data delete existing data or edit it through your c plus application so in order to do that there is another command that is used for that it's called navigator so i'm going to look for it here okay it's tbind navigator i am going to put it here and just make it a little bit bigger like this um okay and how am i going to connect this navigator so that it knows that it should work with this with this students table well again you need to right click on your navigator and click oh where is it so right click on it and click on bind visually and you will get a window like this one and again just drag and drop this here like this and all done so if i start the program now let's see what's going to happen why is it taking so long okay so here is my application and then if i want to add a new record click on this plus symbol and then put here three and then let's say bill gates and then great is going to be six i've heard that he wasn't such a great student at university so let's give him a six okay and then i think that he's around 60 years old and in order to confirm this transaction click on this check mark here and that is it so if i close this application and then open it again as you can see we have three students selena elon and bill gates so we have permanently saved our data to our database so it doesn't matter if you close your application turn off your pc this data is going to be saved into your database and then if you want to delete a record let's delete bill gates he was a college dropout after all so let's delete him delete record ok and then if i close the application start it again as you can see again we have only two students and then if you want to change something just click on the field that you want to change let's say elon musk okay and then commit this transaction like this and this should be stored in the database so let's check it through the database let's open our ib console and then if i say select all from students and press f5 as you can see now we have elon musk okay so i believe that is enough for this video i will leave all the links and the code from this video in the description or i will pin it in the comment make sure to check both and i will also link some additional resources like books and courses that i like in case that you want to learn more so if you enjoyed this video and if you want more videos like this one make sure to give this video a thumbs up so that i know uh or let me know in the comments if you want an sql dedicated course so an entire course dedicated only to sql so thank you very much for watching and i will see you in some other video bye
