hey want to buy some course okay I am proud to tell you that my practical programming course is finally out and in this short video I will tell you why you absolutely have to buy it but before that here is a short story of how it all came together I have always wanted to be a teacher always and I would even dare to say that I have a talent or a gift for teaching if you ask me the whole purpose of a human civilization is to acquire and on the knowledge and that is exactly what we have been doing since the very beginning and that is also a reason why I always wanted to be a teacher but you cannot live off of a dream so as many of you I also started programming because it seemed as a good way to earn some nice money and not just for the sake of money but for the sake of quality of life my own and those that are important to me so my cats when I was starting I didn't have any any prior experience with coding whatsoever and no one in my inner circle of people to guide me or to help me uh in high school I studied languages and I was playing accordion I'm not even joking so I did go to university and I studied software engineering but the knowledge that I was getting there wasn't enough so even though University was very expensive um somehow the knowledge that I was getting there was superficial it seemed like I was memorizing things rather than truly understanding them so very soon I turned to YouTube online courses different teachers but that also became very overwhelming and for two reasons mostly the first reason is that there was just so much to learn uh languages Frameworks tools backend front end mobile where do I start oh my God the second reason and this is a big one is that the the mentors that I've been learning from they seemed somehow more interested in showing how smart they are rather than simplifying things so that they are easy to understand for students because that has a point right so all in all it seemed as an endless struggle eventually I finished University and I got my first job for the great salary of drums please $400 but I'm from Balkans and in my country it it was considered to be decent money and honestly I was over the moon I finally got a chance to put my skills to test and to make profit from that which I did I worked my sweet ass off for the next two years I was solving problems on a daily basis I was completing all of my tasks on time I became crucial member of my team uh and I never stopped learning during that process so soon enough I started feeling like I'm not compens compensated enough for all the work that I do uh because I saw how much I'm contributing but I grew up in a very conservative environment and my parents my friends they would always tell me you have a nice secure job so don't leave it because if you lose it what if you can't find job later so I listened to them and I kept my job but I started looking for freelance opportunities on the side and I was so happy when I got my first freelance project for $20 per hour I used to work8 hours for my company and after I get home four or five more hours and on the weekends as well most of the weekends uh so that lasted for two more years and during that time I burned out completely so I decided to leave my company because they were paying me peanuts and at that point I already had a proof that I can earn a lot more I sent three job applications three companies abroad uh and one did not reply at all one rejected me but one accepted so we got into interviews and all and I asked for 5,000 bucks per month um I was laughing so hard uh not in terms of knowledge because I really knew everything that they were asking for I just didn't know if anyone would be willing to pay me that much money because up to that point I was earning 2 and a half sometimes 3,000 uh but for two jobs I used to work 15 hours per day but they accepted and I remember the first month that I earned $5,000 for 7 hours of work and not 15 like I used to at that point I was like I'm going to be rich baby and my parents they didn't believe that was my salary they thought I got into something illegal drugs crime selling booty I don't know but I was selling brains booty is not for sale for me that was a moment of breakthrough because I saw how much opportunity there is and I lost the fear of not having a job so I started switching jobs more often every few months and soon enough it got me to a salary of $20,000 per month now I want you to contemplate on that for a moment from $400 to $20,000 per month in less than 6 years during this time I have gained tons of knowledge and I have collected crazy experience I know how it is to work on big projects with a lot of great developers and I also know how it is to work completely alone with no one to help you I have worked remotely not being tied to a chair 9 to5 in some office while life is happening out there and I have also coded from my bed in pajamas and I have also coded from a beach in Maldives Italy France Dubai and much more I had the freedom to pick the projects that I really enjoyed uh and most importantly it allowed me to organize my time so that I can focus on what I truly enjoy and that is teaching so I have put all of my experience and knowledge into this practical course so all of the knowledge that I have collected over the past 10 years is carefully explained in simple words demonstrated on practical examples and most importantly understandable to Absolute beginner initial 100 lessons are already available and you can clck the clink you can click the link in the description and start learning immediately this is just one small part of all of the topics that you are going to learn in this course every week I will upload new video lessons new exercises tasks for you to practice until we cover everything that you need to know and you will not need any other courses after this one also you will get access to exclusive community of developers where you can ask questions share experiences and collaborate with other developers in this course we will be writing C but we will not focus just on learning C it will be a tool for me to shape your programmers mind because in this course I will not simply teach you to code I will also teach you to create to innovate and to solve problems so all the skills that you get in this course will be absolutely transferable to any other progamming language or any other application that you want to build in the future and the goal of this course is not for you to learn enough programming just to get a job the goal is for you to understand it so well so that you can pick the job that you enjoy the most and after you truly understand programming only the SKU the limit so everything that I did you can most definitely do as well and I want you to keep in mind on one very important thing and that is the fact that unlike some people on the internet who live pretty good Lifestyles thanks to the money that they make by selling courses everything that I have earned so far comes exclusively from my developer skill and not the course itself because I'm just releasing it I haven't made a single penny from it so that means that you also don't have to sell courses in order to make a good living you can code and work on projects that you truly enjoy and that you like the most the same way that I have come to a point in my life where I can also pick to do what I like most and that is teaching and passing my knowledge on to you I created this course for those of you who want to make some
