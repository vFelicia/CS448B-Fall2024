hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is saldina and i make it and programming related videos so if that is something that is of interest to you consider subscribing to my channel and give this video a thumbs up as well now in this video i want to show you how you can build an atm application and the first thing that i want to do in order to build this application is going to be to plan the functionalities that this application is going to have so i'm going to put a comment here and then here we are going to write all the functionalities that our atm is going to have so the first one is going to be to check the balance so i'm going to write that so check balance and then another functionality is going to be to deposit money so let's say deposit like this okay and then what else well we should be able to withdraw money as well so let's write that okay and i definitely want to show the menu to my user so i'm going to write that as well so i'm going to say show menu like this okay now after we have written these functionalities that we want to implement the first one that i want to implement is going to be this show menu function so i'm going to put the code for this show menu functionality in a function and let's create that function here so i'm going to say void it is going to be of void return type let's call it show menu like this oh like this okay and then what i want to do here is i want to write out the menu to my user so i'm going to say see out and then let's add these star symbols four five six seven eight nine ten that is going to be enough like this and then i'm going to copy this on the other side so that it looks proportional okay and then the first option that i want to write out to my user is going to be uh let's add first and then check balance so that is going to be the first option that our user can choose and then let's add a couple more of these so the second option is going to be deposit so i'm going to write that like this and then the third option is going to be to withdraw so i'm going to copy this here and then paste it here okay and then let's add these star symbols at the end of our menu like this okay now after we have created this show menu function what i want to do is i want to invoke this function so here i'm going to say show menu like this okay and if i run my program as you can see we have this menu shown to our user now what should happen next is we should allow our user to choose one of these three options so the next thing that i will do is i will create a variable so let's create it here let's say and and that variable is going to store the option that our user chooses so i'm going to call it option like this and then here after i have written out this menu so this menu here to my user i'm going to say see out and then please choose an option or whatever message you want to show so option like this and then i want to accept the value that my user enters in this option variable so i'm going to say see in option like this okay now if i run this program again as you can see it asks for option and if i select any of these three options if i press three for example you can see that my program closes because we haven't written any code after this line here so what i want to do now is i want to handle these three options and i'm going to handle these three options using a switch case so i'm going to write switch okay and then here i want to put this option variable so that is going to be the value that i want to check so i'm going to say switch option and then in the case that our user has entered option 1 what i want to do is i want to write out the balance to my user and in order to do that i'm going to create a balance variable because we do not have a balanced variable yet so i'm going to give it a type double like this and call it balance okay and let's assign it initial value of uh for example 500 okay so that is going to be the initial value of our balance um variable so here i'm going to say c out and then let's see balance is okay and then let's write out this balance variable and i'm going to add this dollar symbol at the end and i'm going to add and line as well okay so that is going to happen in the case that our user enters value or option 1 and i'm going to add break at the end of each case so here as well okay now our second case is going to be when our user enters option two like this so in that second case we should allow our user to deposit money so here i'm going to say see out and then let's write out um deposit amount so we want to ask our user how how much money he wants to deposit so in order to accept the value that our user enters i'm going to create a variable which i'm going to call deposit amount so let's create that variable it's going to be of type double and it is going to be called deposit amount like this and then i'm going to accept the value that our user enters here in my deposit amount variable like this okay and now what i want to do with this deposit amount is i want to add it to my balance so i'm going to say balance is now going to be equal to whatever my balance was previously holding plus this deposit amount like this and then let's add break at the end as well okay and then our third option our third case is going to be when our user wants to withdraw money so i'm going to copy this case here and then paste it here and here i want to write out a different message to my user so i'm going to say withdraw amount let's copy this okay and then this variable i'm going to call it withdraw amount like this okay and then here i want to enter that withdraw amount and what i'm going to do with my balance in that situation is going to be i want to subtract that withdraw amount from my balance but i want to subtract that withdrawal amount only in a situation where this withdrawal amount is equal to or less than this balance so i'm going to say here if we draw where it is withdraw amount is less than or equal to balance like this then i want to give that money to my user else meaning if our user has requested more money than he has i'm going to write out a message so i'm going to say not enough money like this okay and that is going to happen so this code here is going to happen in the case that our user enters option three which is this one here okay so now if i run my program you can see that it asks option and let's see that we want this first option so this check balance and it says that balance is 500 and if i press anything else as you can see my program is going to close and that is because we haven't implemented any loop that is going to iterate this code here so let's add that loop now so here i'm going to say do so do while loop is the one that i want to use and then inside my do while loop i'm going to put all of this code here so let's add a curly bracket close curly bracket at the end like this and then i'm going to say please do this block of code here while and then i want to do this code here while the option that my user has end oh option that my user has entered is not equal to 4 and when my user enters option 4 we should stop the execution of our program so in order for our user to know that for means exit we are going to write that here in our show menu function so here i'm going to add this fourth option which is going to exit our program like this okay now if i run this code you can see that it says that it has this menu here and then it asks for option so i'm going to enter option one for example okay and this option one says that balance is 500 dollars now let's enter this second option let's enter this deposit option so i'm going to press 2 and as you can see it says please enter a deposit amount so let's say that i want to deposit 700 for example okay now if i check my balance again so i have entered this option one and then i press enter as you can see it says that my balance is one thousand and two hundred dollars and there is one thing that i want to do with this program because i don't like the way that this looks it is not really readable so i'm going to add um clear screen so clear console command and i'm going to add that here so after my user chooses his option i want to clear the console so i'm going to say system and then let's add cls which is a command that is going to clear my console clear my window so if i run my program again as you can see again we have this menu and then it asks us for the option so let's say that i want to check my balance it says that my balance is 500 now let's try to withdraw money let's say that i want to withdraw money and i want to withdraw 600 dollars for example and then it says not enough money because we had 500 um on our account so now what i want to do is let's say for example that i want to deposit 100 okay and then i want to withdraw 600 dollars okay and if i check my balance now as you can see balance is zero and in order to test this exit functionality let's press 4 and then if i press enter as you can see my application is going to close now another thing that i want to check is going to be what is going to happen if our user enters option that is not valid meaning an option that is not any of these four that we have covered here so if i run my program again as you can see it asks us to enter options so i'm going to enter option 5 for example which is not valid and nothing has happened if i enter option 9 nothing has happened again 99 okay now you get the point what is happening here is our program tries to find this adequate option so option five option nine whichever one we have selected and since that option does not exist in these cases here our program continues to this while check and then it checks that the option is not equal to 4 and because our option is 5 or 9 or 99 which is not equal to 4 then our do while iterates again and then it writes this show menu again and then it asks us to enter this option again so these three options are the only valid options that you can select and then four means that you are going to exit your program now here we have created this show menu function that has a check balance deposit withdraw and then this exit option and what i want to suggest to you is how you can upgrade this program on your own so for example you can create two users two accounts and what you can do with those two users is you can implement transfer option meaning um transfer money from one account to the other account and i'm going to leave that up to you and if some of you decide to write that code make sure to paste it in the comments down below and i'm going to review that code and some other people may find it useful as well so i hope that you enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that bell icon as well and i'm going to see you in my next video bye
