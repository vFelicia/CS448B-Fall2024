hello everyone welcome to my channel in this video i want to talk about a very important topic called structures and i will show you how you can build very interesting program and then considering that you always ask me to give you an example that you can use to practice on your own at the end of this video i have a perfect example that is going to serve as a test for your knowledge but don't just skip to that part because it is important for you to watch the entire video so that you can get the knowledge necessary in order to solve that task and then also for those of you that use instagram uh please take a screenshot of your code or take a picture of this video and put it to your story and write something like learning programming with true code beauty or learning c plus with true code beauty and don't forget to tag me because then i will be able to see your story and i love watching your stories so i will have a link of my instagram profile in the description of this video and then twitter as well for those of you that don't use instagram so without further ado let's start with today's video as i said in this video i want to talk about structures and for those of you that are familiar with the way that i teach you already know that i don't like to give definitions but i prefer to give you a real life example because that is much better for understanding so that is going to be the case for this video as well that is how i'm going to explain what are structures and in order to be able to understand what are structures you first need to understand what are basic or builtin data types and by this i mean data types like integer and float and double and pool and character and so on so if you are not familiar with those i will link a video here and in the description down below as well where you can watch everything that you need to know about data types and then you can come back to this video and learn about structures now for those of you that are familiar with those basic builtin data types i'm going to say that structures are a little bit more complex data type in what way well they are not built in but they are user defined data type now let me show you on code and on real life example what i mean by this what i mean by userdefined data type so let's say for example that you want to store the name of your smartphone in your program in order to do that you would have to create a variable of type string and then call it name or smartphone name i'm going to say name in this case and then here i'm going to assign iphone 12 like this okay now let's create another variable let's say for example that we also want to store the information about how much storage space this iphone 12 has so i will create a variable of type int call it storage space and here i will say for example 32 gigabytes although i might be completely wrong with this one i have no idea it is probably more something like 64 or 128 so feel free to correct me in the comments down below but just don't be too harsh okay and let's create another variable also of type string and let's call it color and i will say that this iphone will be black like this okay and let's do uh the last one which is going to be float price okay and here i will say that this iphone 12 costs for example um 999.99 again i have no idea and i might be completely wrong and it is probably more something like this i don't know uh so please comment the current price of iphone 12 if you're watching the video now and then if you're watching it three or four years since i published it uh please comment the current price of iphone 12 so that we have documentation or history of uh the price of iphone 12 going down okay so i will delete this i will say that this is some sort of budget iphone or something like that okay so here i have created four variables name storage space color and price and they all describe a smartphone which is in this situation an iphone that has 32 gigabytes of storage space it is black and it costs 999.99 now what is going to happen if i want to describe another smartphone well um using the knowledge that we have so far i would have to copy these variables here so i will do that i will copy this and then paste it here and here i will say name to and then store space 2 and color two and price two okay now here instead of iphone 12 i will say for example samsung galaxy oh uh s21 ultra like this and let's say for example that samsung has 64 gigabytes of memory and it is gray and uh it costs for example 888.88 dollars okay and while we are talking about this please write me your answer in the comments down below which one do you prefer iphone or samsung i am very very interested to read what you are going to answer to this question now with that being said i also want to tell you about a problem that i see with this code here and that problem is following imagine if we wanted to describe two more smartphones or 200 smartphones or 2 000 smartphones then we would have very very big problem because using the approach that we used so far in order to describe 1000 smartphones for example we would have to copy this 1000 times so at the end we would have name 1000 and storage space 1000 and color 1000 and price 1000 and so on and that would become very hard to maintain very very soon so that means that this approach here is not optimal and there is a better approach to solve this problem here now what is that approach well wouldn't it be very cool if we could group all of these variables here because after all they are part of one logical collection they all describe the same thing which is a smartphone so name storage space color price they all describe a smartphone in this situation so can we define our own data type called smartphone the answer to that question is yes we can and that is going to be user defined data type which is also called structure so how can we create a structure how can we create our own user defined data type well it's pretty simple you put struct keyword and then you give the name to your structure and in this situation i will call it smartphone like this and then you put curly brackets and at the end you need to have semi column it is very important to have this semicolon at the end okay now here i have created a smartphone structure but it is empty as you can see and what i want to put inside these curly brackets here well i want to put all of the variables that describe a smartphone i want to put all of the attributes that describe a smartphone and here we have uh defined for so name storage space color and price so i will put those here i will say that every smartphone has name of type string like this and then it also has storage space which is going to be of type int like this and then let's say string color and float price okay now here we have created four attributes that describe this structure here and you can create many more if you want so um you can create attributes that say what kind of battery this smartphone has what kind of cpu and then size of display and whether it has wireless charging or not and so on so you can recognize and define your own attributes your own members for this structure here but here i have four which is going to be enough for this example and then one very important thing that i want you to notice is that this structure here there is no data we don't assign data to these attributes here like we did here why well because this here does not represent data this structure here actually represents a blueprint this structure will serve as a model every time that we want to create a variable of type smartphone so when we decide that we want to create a variable of type smartphone this structure here will here will say hey your smartphone needs to have a name a storage space a color and a price so this structure here is a blueprint now uh your question might be okay salina how can we create a variable of type smartphone well the answer is pretty simple it is actually the same as if you wanted to create a variable of type integer or character or something like that so first you specify the type and then you give the name to your variable so let's do that same thing with our smartphone variable so i'm going to say the type which is smartphone like this and then i will give the name to my variable and let's call it smartphone like this only use this lowercase s because it is not going to allow you to use capital s here because that is already reserved for this structure here okay so i will use lowercase s and this is going to work because c plus is case sensitive language which means that it distinguishes between the lowercase and uppercase letters and that means that these two things will be two different things for your compiler because this has lowercase s and then this here has uppercase s even though they both say smartphone okay um now your question might be how can i define all of these values here so how can i define the name of the smartphone and its storage space and color and price well the answer to that question is pretty simple so you put the name of your variable so smartphone like this so this is the name of the variable and then this here is the name of the type or structure and then if you are using visual studio after you put this dot here you will get a list of all of the attributes of that smartphone and this list here is alphabetically ordered so color name price and storage space so let's define name first i will say that name is equal to iphone 12. let me copy this actually okay like this and then let's define storage space i will say smartphone dot storage space is equal to 32 and let's copy this two more times here i will say color and color is black let's copy this okay and then the last one is price and price is 999.99 okay so with this we have successfully created a variable of type smartphone that has these attributes here and the values of those attributes are here and this is how we assign the values to the attributes of this userdefined data type now this here means that we can delete this part of the code here because we don't need it anymore because we literally have created the same thing here so i will delete it okay and then what i want to do is i want to do this same thing for our samsung galaxy smartphone so let's create another variable of type smartphone and in this situation i will call it smartphone2 okay and then here i will say let me copy this okay so i will say smartphone 2 dot name will be samsung galaxy s21 ultra like this and then smartphone 2 dot storage space will be 64 and then smartphone 2 dot color will be gray okay and then smartphone 2 dodge price is going to be 888.88 okay so after we have done this i can delete this part here as well okay now with this code here we have created two variables of type smartphone this one here and then this one here and what i want to do now is i want to write out this data that we have here and then this data that we have here so let's do that let's say see out and then i will say here name and then what i want to do what i want to write out will be this name here so the name of my first smartphone so i will just copy this part here like this so again you put the name of your variable and then you put the name of the attribute of that structure that you want to access in this situation that is going to be name okay and then let's add endline okay and now i'm going to copy this line four times so here i want to write out storage space so storage space and then smartphone and instead of writing out name attribute i will write out storage space like this and then let's add gigabytes like this okay and then this third line will be color so i will say color and then here color and then this last one will be for price so let's say price is equal to smartphone dot price like this perfect so if i run this program as you can see here we have name is iphone 12 and then storage space is 32 gigabytes and color is black and price is 999.99 okay let's close this and for this second smartphone you can do this same block of code here so you can literally copy this part here and then paste it and instead of writing out smartphone.name you can write out smartphone2.name and then smartphone2.storagespace and smartphone2.color and so on but i want to show you something else and that is going to be how you can use functions in combination with structures now for those of you that are not familiar with functions at all i recommend you to watch my video related to functions or actually a playlist which i will link here and in the description of this video as well and there you can find everything that you need to know and learn about functions in c plus but for those of you that already are familiar with functions or that have watched that playlist that i mentioned i will just say that the main goal that we are creating and using functions is to make our code reusable so that we can instead of copying our code we can invoke that function and have that behavior that we desire and in this situation what i want to achieve is i want to create a function that is going to write or print all of the information about a smartphone whether it is this smartphone or this smartphone or any other smartphone if we decide to create 10 smartphones or a thousand smartphones we can just invoke that function and we can say hey here is a smartphone please print out the data that is related to that smartphone so as i said i want to create a function and let's do it here here i will say that the function will be of return type void so i will say void and then let's call that function print smartphone info so print smartphone info i hope that i didn't make any typo okay so what i want to do inside this function is basically this part here so this code here so i will just delete it from here and then i will paste it here inside my function so now as you can see this function here prints out the name of a smartphone and storage space and color and price and here we have an error which says identifier smartphone is undefined which means hey i don't know what is this smartphone here because i have my own scope which is from this curly bracket until this curly bracket here and i don't have any variable which is called smartphone now what we want to achieve with this function is we want to pass a smartphone as a parameter or argument to this function and then we want that function to write out all the data about that smartphone so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pass a structure here so i will say smartphone like this and then i will give the name to this parameter and that will be smartphone i want to use this name here because we already have it in the code if you wanted for example to use a different name for this parameter if you wanted to say for example my smartphone you would have to use this name here and then here and here and here as well but i'm going to return it to smartphone because it looks more professional so i will say that this function here receives one parameter of type smartphone which is called smartphone and here it just writes out the name the storage space color and price of that smartphone now considering that we have created this function here that means that we can invoke it and pass it any smartphone that we want and it should print the data of that smartphone so let's do that let's say print smartphone info like this and if i open these parentheses as you can see it says that it receives one parameter of type smartphone so let's pass it this one let's say smartphone like this okay and then let's invoke this same function for this second smartphone so i'm just going to copy it but instead of passing it smartphone variable i will pass it this variable here so i will say smartphone 2 okay and if i run my program now let's see what will happen okay here we have information about our first smartphone which is iphone 32 gigabytes black and then almost a thousand dollars and then this second smartphone which is samsung galaxy s21 ultra which has 64 gigabytes it is gray and it costs 888.88 and that is something that we have achieved using this function here which we defined here as you can see so that is how you pass a structure to your function so the approach is the same as if you wanted to pass any other parameter and again if you are not familiar with passing parameters to functions or functions in general i will have that playlist linked in the description of this video so make sure to watch that and then you will understand how functions work in detail now considering that we have been talking about structures in this video i want to show you something else so let's create one more structure let's create a structure called person and i will do that here so i'm going to say struct and let's call it person like this and then again curly brackets and then semicolon at the end and here i will put all of the attributes or at least some attributes that describe a person and i will say for example that a person has name like this that is going to be of type string and then i will say that a person has age for example again here you can add many more attributes that describe a person things like date of birth place where this person lives and then his or hers gender whether this person is married or not what kind of job they do and so on but i will use just these two and then i want to add one more and that is going to be i want to store the information about what kind of smartphone this person has so i want to say that every person owns a smartphone and then i want to store that data about what kind of smartphone that specific person has so i will create another attribute here and that will be smartphone like this and let's call it smartphone but with lowercase s like this so with this we have successfully created another structure which is called person and that person structure has three attributes and those are name age and then what kind of smartphone that person has so how can i create a variable of this structure here let's do that let's say here person like this and i'm going to call this person p for example so here i have created a variable of type person and that variable is called p now what i want to do is i want to assign values to these attributes here so name age and smartphone and let's do that here i will say p dot and then again if you're using using visual studio you will get help from intellisense which is going to give you all of these attributes that a person has those are age name and smartphone so i will say p dot name is going to be equal to salvina like this and then p dot h will be 26 okay and then p dot smartphone here i need to assign a variable of type smartphone so let me choose which one this one or this one which one would you choose please write me that in the comments down below and um for this occasion i will go with this smartphone too so samsung galaxy s21 ultra please don't judge me okay so here i have created a variable of type person called p and then i have assigned um values to its attributes so saldena age 26 and then smartphone will be this variable here so smartphone 2. okay now what i want to do with this person is i want to create another function like this one here that is going to print all of the informations about a person so let's do that here so let's say void print person info like this okay and here i want to pass a structure which will be person structure so i will say hey this function here will receive a parameter of type person and i will call it person or p or something like that okay and what i want to do inside this function is i want to say see out and then name will be person okay person dot name like this and then add and line okay and then i want to do that same thing for age so i will say age will be person dot age and then considering that this person here has smartphone as well i know that i have this function here that already writes out information about a smartphone so what i can do is i can invoke this function here inside this function here so i can say print smartphone info like this and as you can see this function expects a variable of type smartphone so what i want to pass to this function will be person dot smartphone perfect okay so with this we have reused this code here multiple times so let's invoke this function here in our main function so i want to invoke it here i will say print person info and then here i want to pass a variable of type person any person we have only this one which is called pe so i will say print person info and then pass p okay and before i run my program let me comment these two lines so that we can see output of this function only so if i run my program now as you can see we get name which is our user name or our person name that is saldena ages 26 and then this name here which represents the name of our smartphone is samsung galaxy s21 ultra and then storage space is 64. color gray and price is 888 okay let's stop this perfect now uh what happens if i decide to change a smartphone for example what happens if i decide to ditch this samsung galaxy and to buy this smartphone here so iphone 12 well i would say here smartphone so i just change it on one place and then if i run my program again as you can see we get different outputs so it is again salvina and then 26 but this time we have a different smartphone and that is iphone 12 32 gigabytes black and then a thousand dollars okay perfect now one thing that i promised you in the beginning of this video is that i will give you a task that you can use to practice on your own this is something that has been requested in many videos that i published so far and guys even though i cannot manage to answer to all of your comments and all of your requests i do read all of your comments and this is something that has been repeated in multiple comments so here it is i decided to create a perfect test for your knowledge so this here is going to be a perfect test of the knowledge that you have gained so far so in order to solve this task you will not use only the knowledge from this video but you will need to combine the knowledge from my multiple videos and i will link that in the description down below all of those videos so make sure to watch them all and understand them and it is going to be perfectly okay and perfectly normal if you need to rewatch some videos multiple times and then if it takes you multiple hours or days or even weeks to solve this problem because this here is going to be perfect test of your programming knowledge and of your understanding of programming and then another thing is that um once you solve this problem please paste your code in the comments down below and then one thing that i would like to encourage is to create a discussion about that code in the comments down below so you can take someone else's code and try to review that code try to understand it and run it in your visual studio and try to make improvements to that code because that is going to be the best way to learn uh because if you start working for any company chances are that you will not be working alone and you will have a team so you will need to read and understand other people's code and you will need to review it so it is better to prepare for that now so again once you solve this problem or just part of this problem please put it in the comments down below and then try to help other people try to give them advice on how they can improve their code and then what things can be done better or in a different way and so on so let me write the code of the program that i want you to build and then i will be back to show you how that program should behave so here i have built a quiz app as you can see and then i have hidden code so that you cannot see it because this is going to be a test for you so i will not show you the code i will only show you how this app should behave uh so the idea is to build a quiz application that has five questions you can create application that has 500 questions if you want but in order to prove that you understand how this problem should be solved it is going to be enough to create just five questions so you have a quiz application that has five questions and each one of those questions will give you three offered answers two of those three answers will be incorrect and then one will be correct and your user will have to give his own response and he will have to choose between those three answers and then you write out the information to your user if he chose the correct or the incorrect answer so let's run this application so that you can see how it works okay so as i said here is the question what is the smallest country and then you get three answers uh usa india and then vatican city two of those three are incorrect and then one is correct so as you can see it asks me to choose between one and three so one or two or three and i will say that the smallest country is tree so vatican city and if i press enter as you can see we get correct okay and then it asks second question so what is the biggest animal in the world elephant blue whale or great white shark well let's say for example that the biggest animal is elephant so one okay and that is incorrect and then you get the third question and so on so this is the application that i want you to build and here i want to give you a few tips that will be useful for you in order to build this application so if you take a look at this quiz application you should notice a few things the first one is that question is going to be a structure and that structure that question structure will have two members at least two so the first one will be text of that question and then second will be an array of three answers now if you are not familiar with arrays i will recommend you to watch my video related to arrays which i will link in the description down below and then here probably so again each structure of type question contains text of that question and then an array of three answers two of those three answers will be incorrect and then one will be correct okay and then another thing that you should notice is that answer is a structure as well now this here is an answer and then this here and this here and this here as well and so on so each answer should have the text of that answer and then in the background you should store the information if that answer is correct or not so if it is true or false now another tip that i want to give you will be related to writing out these questions and then answers that belong to that specific question in order to do that you will need to learn again arrays and then you will need to learn about loops i recommend you to learn about for loop and then nested for loop as well and those videos will be linked in the description as well so i will make a group where i will link all the videos necessary for you to watch and understand in order to build this program here so you write out the question and then for each question you write out the array of three answers that that question has and then again you do that same thing for the second question and for the third fourth fifth and so on so this application here is going to be a perfect test of your programming knowledge and of your understanding of programming and this application is something that you can even put to your portfolio for your first job so you can say to your employer hey here is this very cool application that i built it is quiz application and then there are many ways that you can upgrade this application so you can for example add points to this application you can add multiple users you can add levels uh you can add certain money prices and so on but that can come up later when you progress with your programming knowledge and who knows maybe one day uh your application reaches millions of people and your application earns uh millions of dollars so a lot of people and a lot of money so i wish you a good luck with solving this problem here and building this quiz application and again it is going to be perfectly normal if it takes you multiple hours or days or weeks depending on how much of programming you have learned so far and it will also take you uh knowledge from multiple videos that i mentioned which i will link in the description down below as well and then you will also have to think and try to come up with your own ways to solve a specific problem because that is what programmers do it is not just copying and pasting code and understanding certain basic concepts it is more about connecting those concepts together and then trying to find a way an approach to solve a specific problem so again i wish you a good luck with solving this problem and then uh put your code in the comments down below if you solve this problem or if you solve a part of this problem and try to review code of other people and also if you think that i should make a video where i solve this problem together with you please write that in the comments down below as well if you want my solution so thank you very much for watching and i am going to see you in my next video bye
