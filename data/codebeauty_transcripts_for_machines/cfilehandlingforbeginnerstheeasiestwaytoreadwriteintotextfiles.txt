hi everyone and welcome to my channel in this video i want to teach you how you can read and write from text files using c plus programming language and it is very easy as you will see so once i show you the code and explain everything you will never forget it uh but before i start i would like to take a brief moment to introduce c plus plus builder it is full featured c plus plus ide that helps you create apps fast for all major platforms while writing less code it connects natively to almost 20 databases like mariadb oracle sql server postgres and many more the key value is c plus builders framework which are powerful libraries that do more than other c plus tools this includes the awardwinning vcl framework for highperformance native windows apps and fire monkey framework for crossplatform uis smart developers write better code faster and you can start for free using the link in the description so how do you write and read from text files using c plus programming language well the first step is that we need to include a library that is going to help us to work with files and that library is called f stream so the same way that we use iostream so that we are able to input an output to our console so to read and write from our console we are going to use f stream library so that we are able to read and write from files so that is going to be the first step i am going to say include f stream like this and okay and inside this f stream library there are a few data types so the data type that we are going to use is also called f stream so what i want to do is i want to declare a variable of type f stream so i will say f stream and i am going to call that variable my file okay so now i'm going to use this my file variable so that i can open files close files read and write from those files so the first thing that i want to show you is how you can write into a text file so in order to be able to write into a text file the first thing that you need to do is you need to open that file so how do you do that well you say my file dot open like this and this open function receives two parameters two arguments the first one is going to be the name of your file and then the second one is going to be the mode in which that file is going to be open so is that going to be a write mode or read mode or append mode or something else so as i said the first parameter is going to be the name of your file so i'm going to use these quotation marks and here i'm going to say that the name will be salvina dot txt like this and make sure to use this dot txt extension because we want to write into text files so this is going to be the first parameter this is the name of the file that will be opened and if this file does not exist it is going to be created okay and then the second parameter as i already said is going to be the mode so what i want to do is i want to teach you how you can write into a text file so the mode is going to be right so you use ios and then you put two column signs and here you are going to say that you want to output from this program here into this file here so the mode is going to be out like this so that is the mode that we use in order to write into a text file so this here is a write mode okay so how do you write into this file here well the first step is you need to make sure that this stream has been opened successfully so you need to make sure that you have successfully opened this file here and for that you are going to say if my file is open like this okay so if this file here has been opened what you can do is you can write into that file so how do you write into a file well the approach is very similar to the approach of writing into a console in order to write into a console you use see out command and then you use these two redirection signs and then you write the text that you want to output to your console so let's say for example hello and let's add a new line like this so this is the approach that you use to output text to a console now the approach to output text to a file is very similar so instead of c out object you use this object here so you just say my file and then these two redirection signs and then you put the text that you want to output to your file okay so let's add another line let's say for example my file these two redirection signs and then let's say this is second oh this is second line okay so with this we have successfully outputted two lines of text to our file and what we should do now is we should close that file so after you have finished writing or reading from your file you should close that file and again it is very easy to do that you just say my file dot close like this okay so those are all the steps that you need in order to write into a file so first you open that file you specify the name and the mode in which that file is going to be opened and then you check if that file has been opened successfully and then you can write into that file and after you have finished writing you are going to close that file okay so one thing that i want to show you now is right click on this cpp read write file so right click on your project and then select this option here open folder in file explorer so after i have done that this project is going to be opened in my file explorer and here we have all of the files of this project here now what should happen after i run this program is that a file called saldena.txt should be created and it should contain this text here so let's check that i am going to run this program okay and as you can see there is nothing inside our console because we have not interacted with our console at all we have just interacted with a file so i am going to press enter in order to close this console and if i right click on this project and then open folder in file explorer you are going to see this file called saudina and it is a text document so if i open that file as you can see inside that file there are two lines of text hello and then this is second line which means that we have successfully outputted this text here into a file called salvina.txt so that is how you write into a text file using c plus plus but what is going to happen if you want during the execution of your program to append something more so to append some other text to this file here so i'm going to copy all of this code and then paste it here and what i want to do is i want to say hey please open this file again so that i can write into that file and check if that file has been opened and then what i want to write what i want to append into that file is hello to and then nothing else i just want to say hello to and after i have appended that i just want to close that file so what do you expect to happen after i run this program here so if i run it again there will be nothing in our console i'm just going to close it okay and if i open this in file explorer and if i open this file what is going to be inside this file write me in the comment section so as you can see here we only have hello to which means that okay which means that all of this text here has been overridden so only this text here is present inside our salina.txt file that is because every time that you use this output mode you are going to override that file so if you want to append new information to the information that is already present inside your file you are going to use a mode called append so you are going to say ios and then app and that is append mode like this so this code here says please open a file called salina.txt and i want to append some new information to that file so make sure that it has successfully been opened and then append this text here so hello to and then close that file so if i run this program okay and then i open it in file explorer and then i double click on this saldena.txt as you can see here we have hello this is second line and then hello to which means that we have successfully appended this text to already existing information inside this file here so that is how you write into your file and then append into your file and then the third thing that i want to show you is how you can read from a file so let's delete all of this code here because i don't need it and now i'm going to show you how you can read from a file so the first step again is to open a file in a read mode so i'm going to say my file dot open and i'm going to open a file called salvina.txt and the mode is going to be i want to input from this file here into my program so that is going to be read mode so you use ios and then to column size and then in like this and that is going to be a read mode so please input from this file here into this program here okay so after you have opened this file make sure that it has been opened successfully so if my file is open what you can do is then you can read from this file inside these curly brackets here so how are we going to write out the text from this file here well i am going to use a while loop to access every single line of text of this file here so the approach is going to be the following i'm going to access the first line of text and i'm going to store that line into a string variable and then i will write out that variable and then i'm going to access the second line of text again store it into a string variable and write out that variable and i'm going to do that until i come to the last line of text of this file here so for that we are going to use while loop if you are not familiar with while loop i am going to link that video here and in the description as well so make sure to watch that video so as i said the first thing that we will need is going to be a variable in which we will store that line of text so that is going to be a string variable let's say string line like this and make sure to include string library if it is not recognized so make sure to say include string like this okay so here we are going to store a line of text from this file here and then in order to be able to access to every single line of text we are going to use while loop so i will say while okay and here inside this condition what i want to do is i want to use a function from string library which is called get line so i will say get line okay and this function here receives two parameters the first parameter is going to be this object here so my file and then the second parameter will be this variable here so line variable now what this function here does is that it reads from this file here so it reads a line of text and then it stores that line into this variable here and it is going to do that for every single line of text inside this file here and then when it comes to the last line of this file here there will be no more lines there will be no more text to read so at that moment this while loop is going to end okay and then one very important thing is that if you want to use this getline function you need to include a string library okay so after we have successfully read a line of text from this file here we are going to write out that line to our console so i'm going to say c out line and let's add end line like this okay so now i'm going to read every single line of text from this file here using this while loop and then after i have successfully read every single line what i need to do again is close this file here so i am going to say at the end after my while loop finishes my file dot close like this okay and by doing this we should be able to see everything that is inside this file here we should be able to see that in our console so if i run this program let's see as you can see it says hello this is second line and then hello to okay so if i add manually um a text to this saldena.txt file again if i open it and if i add some text manually so if i say for example this is fourth line and then if i say bye bye like this and if i save that make sure to save these changes and close this file and i'm going to close this as well and if i run my program we should be able to see the text that we just added as well so let's see and as you can see indeed it says this is fourth line and then bye bye okay so that is how you read a text from a file in c plus since you always ask me to give you a task that you can use to practice on your own in this video i decided to give you two different tasks so the first task is going to be related to my video about ascii table i am going to link that video here and also in the description and in that video i explained how you can use ascii table in order to cipher every single letter of english alphabet into a number now what i want you to do is i want you to combine the knowledge from that video and this video so that you write your own story or a diary or a secret and then you cipher that text and you write it in a file so whoever decides to open that file manually he's just going to see a bunch of numbers and he's not going to understand anything but you are going to create a program which is going to read from that file decipher those numbers back into letters and then write that text to your console so that you are able to read that story or secret or your diary or whatever you want to store into that file so that is going to be your first task and if you manage to solve this problem put your code in the comment section so that i can see it and that other people can see it as well the second task is a little bit more complex and in order to solve it you will need to learn and know about structures so it is related to my video about structures which i will link here and also in the description so after you watch that video at the end there is a task to build a quiz application now what i want you to do is i want you to use those instructions that i have given in that video in order to build a quiz application but instead of hard coding all of the questions and answers in your c plus application i want you to read those questions and answers from a file so that is going to be your second task and if you manage to solve this task again put your code in the comment section so that i can read it and then other people can see it as well so i wish you good luck with solving these two tasks and it is probably not going to be easy but you should learn and you should practice your logic and your problem solving skills so there you go two tasks to do that and again you are probably going to make many mistakes and the process of learning is not going to be very easy but that is completely normal so if you manage to solve one or both tasks please put your code in the comment section so that i can check it out and that other people can see it as well and if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up because it helps me a lot to reach more people and help them to learn programming and then if you have any questions or if you have any videos that you would like to see in the future um let me know in the comments section and i'm going to make those videos in the future and if you want to see more videos like this one subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon because then you are going to get a notification from me every time that i publish a new video so thank you very much for watching and i am going to see you with some other video
