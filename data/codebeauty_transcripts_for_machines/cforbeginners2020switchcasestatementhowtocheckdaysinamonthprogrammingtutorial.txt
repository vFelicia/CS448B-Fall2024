hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners and in this video I wanted to deepen your knowledge of switchcase so if you're not familiar with switchcase at all if you haven't watched my previous video you definitely have to do that the link is going to be here and in this video I wanted to give you some more examples that you can practice on and introduce some things that I haven't mentioned in my previous video as well so in this video we are going to build a program that is going to require from our user to enter a year and a month as well and then our program has to write out how many days there is in that month so how we are going to do that let's see but first you have to subscribe to my channel and like this video and also share it with your friends as I explained there are two things that we need from our user to enter and those are going to be month and year so let's create two variables let's say year and month like this and now I'm going to write out the message to my user so that he knows that he should enter those two values so here and after that please enter month like this and let's store now the values that our user enters so the first one is going to be stored inside our year variable and then the second one is going to be stored inside our month variable and now we have really covered everything that we need from our user now our program has to check these two variables and then decide how many days there is in that month of that year and we are going to do that using switch case statement but there is one thing that I want to mention before before we start right our switch case and that is you have to take in consideration that there are years that are leap years and that have one day more than the year that is not a leap year and there is a rule for that so I'm going to copy the rule that that is going to help us to determine whether a year is a leap year or not and that is this rule here so any year that when modulated by four gives a result of zero and at this same time that year modulated by hundred is not equal to zero or a year so that same here one modulated by 400 is going to give the result of zero and this here is going to be a definition for our leap year which means a year that has 366 days or a February inside this year has 29 days that's why we need this rule here so now let's write out our switch case statement and if you haven't watched my video on switch case statement I am going to link it here one more time because you really need to understand the switch case and then you can come back to this video and deepen your knowledge on switch case so switch this is going to be the syntax of our switch case but I'm going to delete this default syntax we want to write it ourselves so inside these parentheses here I'm going to put the variable that we are going to switch through and that is going to be our month variable like this so whichever value our user has entered for our month we are going to cover all the potential values that our month can hold in our cases so the first case that I want to cover is going to be the most specific one and that is going to be our February which means second month so I'm going to say in the case that this month variable is equal to two which means that our user is requesting from us to determine how many days our February month has we're really in this case need to check whether that year is a leap year or not and then if that year is leap year that means that our February has 29 days and if not which means if this condition here is not true that means that our second month has 28 days so I'm going to copy this expression here this condition and also if you are not familiar with ternary operator you have to watch that video because in this video we are going to use that ternary operator you can do it as well with ifelse statement but I want you to practice also this because you will you are going to actually come across it in your programming career so here I'm putting this condition for a leap here and I'm going to say this question mark and then I would say if this here is true you have to write out this line of code so you have to write out C out and if this condition here is true that means that our year is a leap year which means that our fury our second month has 29 days so let's say 29 days like this okay and so that is in the situation where this here is true and in the situation where this expression here results as false I'm going to put here a column sign and then I'm going to write out a different message and that is going to be that this second month in the case where a year is not a leap here has actually 28 days so after we have written this expression here so this ternary operator we have really write out how many written out how many days there is in our february month and after each case i have to put break so in this case as well i'm going to put our break command after it and with this example with this case here we have really covered our second month which was the most specific one now we are left to cover the remaining months which means once that have 31 days and also once that have 30 days and here i'm going to show you something that I haven't shown you before let me scroll this code like this maybe okay and then there are some months that contain 30 days and some that contain 30 31 days and the ones that contain thirty days are following so I'm going to write out case like this and then the first one that could contains 30 days is going to be April so forth month and then also our sixth month contains 30 days and then also let's see 4th 6th 9th and then November as well like this and here we have written out really all the months that contain 30 days ok and now I'm going to at the end so at this case here write out a message let me copy this and I'm going to paste it and I'm going to say 30 days month like this ok and I'm going to put break command here as well so let me explain this part of code here because we haven't seen this part of code here before this break statement what it does is when your program so when your program execution actually comes to this case here it says ok my month is equal to 2 so I'm going to execute this part of code here and then it comes to this break command and this break command really breaks the execution of your switch which means that when your program comes to the first break man it is going to stop the execution of your switch there which means that it is not going to check any more cases and because of that you can really here so you can put more than one month you can put all the months that have 30 days like this and then you can write out the same message and put one break command at the end and how that is going to really behave inside your program in the case where a user enters for example month six your program is going to check whether that month is good is equal to two and it's not going to be then it's going to check whether your month is equal to four not as well and then it's going to come here and say ok this is sixth month this that our user has entered so please execute whatever code you find until you come to the first break and there is going to be this here which is empty so nothing and then this here which is as well empty so nothing and then it comes to this code here and that lie so this code here contains this see out message 30 days month so it is going to write out this and then it really comes to this first break command and it breaks your switch which means that it is not going to check any other cases that come after this break okay so in any case whether your user enters month 4 or 6 or 9 or 11 your program is going to execute this line here and then break your switch so with this part of code here we have really covered all months that have 30 days and now we are left to cover the ones that have 31 days and those are months let's see that is our January and then our third month and our fifth and our seventh went like this let me scroll it a little bit more okay and then we have as well case 8 and case as well our December has 31 days so there are seven months that have 31 days five months that have 30 days and one month that has 28 or 29 days and in this line here we are going to write out a message that is going to say 31 days month and as well here we have to put our break command like this okay so I am going to run my program now and show you how this program behaves so our program is asking us to enter a year and a month let's say a year is going to be 2020 which is current here and then a month is going to be let's see it's April so forth and it says that it is a 30day month which is April April has 30 days and let's run our program one more time now let's say 2020 again and let's say that we want check our second month and it says that February of 2020 has 29 days which is correct as well and there is really one more situation that I want to cover and that is going to be a situation where our user enters a number that is not a valid month number and that's the tradition I'm going to cover with my default statement so I'm going to write out default and in this default case as well I want to write out a message to my user like this and inside here I'm going to say not valid which means that our user has not entered a valid month number so let's run our program and if I enter year 2020 and for a month let's say five for example you see that our program has written out not valid ok so I hope that you have liked this video and if you did make sure to subscribe to my channel and share it with anyone who would like to learn programming as well and today is May the 2nd that's when I filming this video I don't know what I'm going to publish it probably in a couple of days and currently we are a little bit over 900 people so let's see how fast this channel can grow thanks for watching and I'm going to see you in my next video bye
