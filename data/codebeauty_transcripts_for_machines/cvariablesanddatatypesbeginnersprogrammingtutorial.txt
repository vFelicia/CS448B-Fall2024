hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video we are going to talk about variables and data types you are going to learn what are variables what are data types what are most commonly used data types in programming as well as what are some common errors that happen to many beginners and we are going to demonstrate all of this in a simple program that we will create together and also I'm going to explain all of this on real world examples so that it is beginner friendly and you can understand everything and before we continue I want to say thank you to the sponsor of this video and that is me so my goal is to teach you practical programming so that you can finally start creating the applications that you want and so that you can get career ready skills and in this course you are going to learn everything that you need in order to start creating those applications that you want so it is going to be beginner to expert practical programming course everything that you need is going to be in one place and it is going to be explained in a beginner friendly way so that you can finally understand programming the course was released a month and a half ago and I can already say that I'm very proud of all of the students who have enrolled in the course and I'm also very proud of their results just today I was talking to a girl who enrolled in the course less than a month ago and the reason why she decided to enroll in this course is because her mom has a personal business she is producing jewelry for girls uh and her mom does not have enough money to pay to a professional programmer to create an application that she needs to manage her clients and to make her work easier so her daughter decided to learn practical programming with the help of my course so that she can create this application as a gift to her mother and in less than a month of learning from my practical programming course she was able to fully plan this application and create it herself so because of that story and many other stories that my students have shared with me I can say that I'm very very proud of the progress that they had made and also I'm proud of the work and the contribution that I am giving to those students so if you also want to learn practical programming if you want to start creating real applications I will leave a link in the description so that you can also enroll in my practical programming course we have a great community of striving developers that are ready to help you that want to collaborate and share their experiences and also I have a special gift for my YouTube viewers so the first 100 people who decide to enroll in the course using the link in the description will get a special discount so if you want to learn practical programming if you want to start creating real applications then don't miss this opportunity click the link in the description and I will see you in my practical programming course in a minute so with that being said let's continue with the topic of today's video so let's create an application where we can demonstrate variables and data types for that we are going to need Visual Studio 2022 Community if you don't know how to install it then make sure to watch my previous video where I explained that it will be linked here and also in the description so I already have visual studio 20202 so let's run it and the first thing that I want to do is I want to create a new project so click on create a new project okay here we are going to select C and here I will select console application so C console application and click on next okay and here we will give a name to our project let's call it variables and data types okay everything should be together everything together variables and data types and click on next and here you should select net 8.0 framework and click on create okay and this is going to create our project so this is the project that we get by default this is the most simple hello world application and if we run it we will simply get this hello world output in our console and then this is some junk text that Visual Studio creates this should not bother you right now so as I said this is the most simple application that we get when we create our project and if you don't understand this again make sure to watch my previous video previous video in this uh playlist it will be linked in the description okay so now I am going to delete this comment we will not need it and I will leave this part because we will need it later so now let's explain what are variables I'm going to give you an example from real life for example in real life you have different types of containers different types of boxes for storing different items for example you have one type of container one type of box that is used to store shoes and then another type of box another type of container that is used to store food and then this also is a type of container this cup that is used in order to store liquid so inside this you can put water milk tea juice and so on so the same way in programming variables are containers that are used in order to store different types of data for example in very Ables we can store an image a character a number a decimal number and so on now the same way that you wouldn't try to store shoes inside this type of container you also wouldn't try to store an image in a variable that is used to store numbers so each variable has its type and that type determines what kind of data it can store in programming we have simple and complex data types in this video we are going to learn what are most commonly used simple data types and then in some of the next videos in the future we are going to learn about complex data types so here on the screen I am going to put a list of most commonly used simple data types and those are integer it is used to store whole numbers so 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 and so on so that is int data type and then we have double and double is used in order to store decimal numbers so 2.5 minus 2.5 and so on and then we have char and Char data type is used in order to store one single character that can be a letter or some special character so that is Char data type if you want to store more than one character then you use another data type and that data type is called string and inside string variable you can store your name or a name of the person that you like or an entire sentence or an essay so string variable can hold as many characters as you want and Char variable can hold only one and then another commonly used data type is bull and bull is used for variables that can have only two values true or or false one or zero an example of that is for example is user logged in that can have only two values either he is logged in or he is not logged in so true or false so those are most commonly used data types in programming so let's see how we can create a variable I will do it here above this line of code so here I want to create a variable that will be Ed to store whole numbers so integer numbers the first thing that we need to specify is the type of variable so since we want to store integer numbers the type will be int and then we give the name to our variable so let's call it YouTube subscribers because the number of YouTube subscribers can be an integer number you cannot have 2.5 subscribers so here I am going to write how many subscribers I have let me check that and I'll be back so I have 269,000 at the moment of filming this video let me know if that changed in the comment section so you put the value that will be stored inside that variable and then at the end you need to put this semic colum symbol because by putting that you say okay here is the end of the command that I have written so here I have created a variable called YouTube subscribers it is of typ type int which means that it can store only whole numbers and here I have assigned the value to that variable so now what I can do is I can take this variable and then here instead of writing hello world in my console I can simply pass the name of my variable and this here should print whatever value is stored inside this variable so console. right line and then here you put the name of the variable so now if I run the program Let's see we should get this value here as you can see it says 2690 0 okay now I have a question for you and that is the following what is going to happen if I try to store a decimal point number into this variable here we already said that this int variable is used in order to store integer numbers which means whole numbers so what will happen if I try to store here a decimal point number for example 2.5 let me know in the comment section okay so if I try to run my program as you can see we get errors which means that this here is not valid now depending on the programming language that you use there are two things that might happen in C as you could already see we will get an error and we will not be able to run our program and some other programming language will maybe just just take this whole part of the number and then it will completely disregard this that comes after decimal point that depends on the programming language that you use but those are two things that can potentially happen as you could see in C we get an error and this is not allowed so I am going to return this to as it was and now I'm going to show you how to create a decimal point variable so for that we use another data type and then is double so I say double and then I give the name to my variable let's say age okay and here I will store my age let's say 21.5 okay this is not my age but it's just an example guys so if you want to store a decimal point number you need a variable of type double so now I am going to put here age and if I run my program we will get 21.5 so whatever is stored inside this age variable that will be printed here okay so here you can already see a pattern when you want to create a variable you first specify its data type and then you give it a name is equal to and then you provide the value for your variable and at the end you put semicolon now let's see how we can create variables of the the other data types because there are some specific rules for example if you want to create a character variable the type would be Char and then you give the name to this variable let's call it gender okay is equal to and then you are going to assign the value which is just one character but you need to put it inside these single quotation marks so here you need to provide one character that will be the value for this variables so you can put f for female or M for male or c for cat or D for dog and so on this was much less complicated when I was first studying programming because there was just F and M nowadays there are a lot more potential values but I am just going to leave this to be an F because I am just an F you can put anything that you want as long as it's just one character because Char variable can accept only one character and if you want to store more than one character then you use a different data type and that is string so let's create a string variable let's say string and the name of this variable will be let's say first name okay and when you want to assign the value to a string variable you need to use double quotation marks so for Char you use single quotation marks and then for string you use double quotation marks and for numbers you don't need anything so here I will put my first name and that is Salina okay and then semic column at the end so this is how you create a string variable and then the easiest one is bull variable so type is called Bull and this variable can hold only two values true or false so the name of this will be for example is student and for myself I will say false because I am not a student if you are a student you can assign a different value you can say true and those are only two values that this bull variable can have so either true or false so here we have learned how we can create variables of different data types and we have learned one very important characteristic of variables and that is each variable has a data type and it determines what kind of data we can put into that variable the same way that type of container determines what kind of item we put into that container into this container we put liquid we don't put shoes now another important characteristic of this container is its size which means inside this glass I can put 100 milliliters of water or 200 milliliters but 500 I don't think so it would overflow because this glass has size so the same way our variables our data types have size for example integer variable can hold whole numbers but how big of a number can we put inside an integer variable well let's see I am going to copy this code and paste it here and here I will need to change the name of my variable because you cannot have two variables with the same name because you will get an error so let's change the name let's call it hold number okay so it can hold this number but can it hold this number let's see okay after some point you get this little red squiggly and that means that you have an error and the reason is because this number is too big and you cannot put it inside a variable that is of this type because integer type cannot store number that is this big the same way that inside this glass We cannot put a million liters of water okay for that we need a bigger glass and for storing a number that is this big we need a different data type and the name of that data type is long so here I will say long and as you could see that little red squiggly that we had here disappeared which means that we don't have a anymore so even though both int and long store the same type of data which means a whole number inside int we can store much smaller numbers and inside long we can store much bigger numbers like this one which I will not try to read the reason for this is because long data type takes a lot more space in memory than int data type which takes a lot less now each data type takes certain space in memory and now your question might be how can I know how much an integer takes how much a long takes or double or Char and so on well you have a special command that will give you the amount of memory that each data type takes for example here inside my console right line I can say please give me the size of and here inside parenthesis I will put size of what so I want size of int okay and then another line I also want size of long okay so if I run the program let's see here it says that int takes four bytes and long takes eight bytes which means that long is twice as big big as integer which means that it can take twice as big of a number as integer so now your question might be okay salinaa but four bytes isn't really a lot of memory so I will always use long you can always use long but there are two reasons why we have both int and long data type the first reason is that this need for saving memory comes from a different time from a time where I was very small and you were also very small and memory was very expensive nowadays you have phones that have 2 terabytes of memory but 50 years ago 4 megabytes of memory was much more expensive than what your phone costs now so in that time it was very important to save as much memory as possible so that is the first reason another reason is the following now you are creating just one variable of type int or long that is four bytes of difference but later when we learn how we can create arrays of variables how you can create for example a million variables then you have to take in consideration if those variables are going to be of type long or of type int because then it's not just four bytes of memory it's four million bytes of memory which is significant it will make your application heavier slower and so on so those are two reasons why you need to know the difference between int and long and now when you're just a beginner and you are learning it doesn't really matter for your tasks which one of these two you are using but in the future it might matter and it might be very important so that is why I'm telling you the difference between these two data types so once more long is twice as big as int which means that it can store twice as big number than integer so now the question is do you have to learn by heart how big of a number we can store inside integer for example and the answer is no there is another command that we can use for that so here inside my console right line I can say int dot please give me what is the Min value that can be stored inside this integer and then here I will say please give me int. max value which means the maximum number that can be stored inside an integer so now if I run my program let's see that okay so here we get minus 2 billi 147 million and something and then this here is plus 2 billion 147 million and so on so this is minimum number and this here is maximum number that you can store inside an integer variable now if you know that you will be storing only positive numbers in your variable and not negative for example for our YouTube subscribers variable it can store only positive numbers you cannot have minus one subscriber if you want to say that specifically then you can use another data type and that data type is called unsigned int meaning there is no plus or minus sign in front of it just positive numbers and it is called uint so unsigned int and here you cannot store negative numbers so if I try to assign here minus 26900 as you can see we get this little red squiggly which means that we have an error so now the question is why would you use U int instead of int well you previously saw that the values for integer go from minus 2 billion and something to plus two billion and something but if you already know that you will be storing only positive numbers then that range can go from zero to 4 billion something which means that you have the option to store much big of a number if you know up front that you will be storing only positive numbers you don't need at all that negative range so let's demonstrate that let's remove this minus sign and here I will say u in minimum value and then u in maximum value like this and if I run this program as you can see minimum value of unsigned integer is zero and then maximum value is 4 billion and something which is much bigger than what we had previously with a simple int variable so again this is used with the purpose of saving memory and optimizing your application now when you're still a beginner it doesn't really matter you will not have an error if you always use long but if you want to optimize your application if you want to save some memory later when you become a good experienced programmer then you should know about these things so we talked enough about int and long and U in let's see if there is anything special about these remaining data types so Char as we said is used in order to store one character nothing special there and then string is used in order to store a string of characters so one or more characters for example a name a sentence an essay and so on nothing special there bull also just two values true or false nothing special but double is very very special double is used in order to store decimal point numbers but there are two more types that are used for the same thing for the same purpose but there is a difference between them so here let's create another variable of type double let's call it decimal number one like this and here I will say for example 2. five okay so this is how we create double variable but there are two more types that are used for the same purpose meaning to store decimal numbers those are float and decimal so I'm going to copy this and here I will say float and I will call this variable decimal number two okay and here in order to indicate that this is float I need to put F okay and that red squiggly error will disappear and then another type is decimal so here I will say decimal and here I will call it decimal number three and here I need to put m in order to indicate that this is decimal number so double does not have any suffix float has F and decimal has M so now the question is what is the difference between between these three so the difference is in their size which means how big of a number you can put inside each one of these three data types so let's check that again I will use size of operator so I will say please give me the size of double okay and I need another parenthesis and then I will also say please give me the size of float another parenthesis and then the last one is decimal so please give me the size of decimal so now let's run our program and let's check the sizes of these three okay and as you can see it says double is8 bytes float is four bytes and decimal is 16 bytes which means that float is the smallest and decimal is the biggest double is in the middle it is twice as big as float so depending on how big of a number you need to store you are going to use one of these three okay and one very important thing that I said and that I want you to remember is if you want to store a bigger number you need to use a bigger data type because that big number has a lot of digits that you need to write in your memory and a bigger data type has more space in memory where you can write all of those digits now the same applies for very small numbers for example you cannot store a number that is this big inside a float variable but you cannot also store a number that is this small inside float variable because both of these numbers have a lot of digits and for storing all of these digits you need bigger space in memory so even though the number is smaller you need a data type which is bigger which is more precise in order to store a number that has this many digits now let's talk about another very important topic and that is naming your variables there are many rules that tell you what you should do and what you should not do when naming your variables and I going to explain both so let's first start with the things that you should not do so let's create a variable let's say that I will create a variable of type double and I will call it age and here comes the first rule and immediately we get this red squiggly and the reason why we are getting this red squiggly is because we already have a variable with the same name we have it here so this error says a local a local variable or function named age is already defined meaning you cannot repeat the name and even if you change the type of this variable again it will not allow you to use a name that already exists so that is the first rule you should not have two variables with the same name there are certain specific situations that we will learn later in the upcoming lessons where you can create variables with the same name but for now at this level don't repeat the names of your variables there is plenty of names for example here you can say Age Two that is perfectly valid name and as you can see that little red squiggly disappeared which means that we don't have an error anymore so the first rule don't repeat the names of your variables the second rule is that the name of your variable cannot start with a number this here is not a valid name you can have a number at the end of the name or in the middle of the name but not at the front so the name of your variable cannot start with a number as you can see here we get identify expected syntax blah blah blah a lot of errors that are very hard to understand for beginners and the reason for that is because the name of the variable cannot start with a number so that is the second rule the third rule is that you cannot have spaces in the names of your variables for example this here is not valid so the name of your variable needs to be one single word or multiple words but written together with no spaces is also you can use underscore like this or for example you can say my age like this but you cannot use other special characters or space so you cannot say this nor this nor this so if you need to separate the words you can use underscore so those are some things that you cannot do now let's see what you should do when naming your variables I will give you one rule to rule them all so that you don't have to remember all of these individual rules and that is the following give meaningful names to your variables and use camel case what does that mean give meaningful names to your variables means name your variables according to their purpose for example YouTube subscribers age gender first name and so on you can also name these variables VAR one and then VAR two and then VAR three like this but this is not really understandable and in a few days you will not remember what VAR one represents what VAR two represents what word three and so on so for that reason give meaningful names to your variables that is first part and the second part is use camel case so what what does Camel case mean it means that the name of your variable should start with the lowercase letter and then if the name contains more than one word each new word should start with a capital letter and everything should be together for example like this or like this or like this or if you want to give a bigger name then you can use common case for that like this so here is a bigger name for my variable like this this is pretty big name but you get the idea of what camel case is so I believe that is going to be enough for this video if you have any questions or any topics that you would like to see in the future let me know in the comment section also if this video was useful if you enjoyed it give it a big thumbs up so that I know to create
