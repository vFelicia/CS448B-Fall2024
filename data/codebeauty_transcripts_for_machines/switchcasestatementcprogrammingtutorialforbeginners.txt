hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video I'm going to teach you about switch case statement which is very important and commonly used in programming I will share some tips tricks and common errors that happen and together we are going to build an application so let me show you the application that we are going to build as you can see the app asks you to select a language we have nine languages and then depending on which language you select the application is going to respond and greet you in that language so if I I say one the application says hello and welcome and then let's start the application again if I select for example um Hindi and I press enter as you can see here we get Namaste okay uh and then if you select something else which is not a valid choice for example 99 as you can see you get invalid choice so this is the application that we are going to build today together and you are going to learn how to use switch case statement also if you want to learn the skills and knowledge necessary to become a successful software developer or if you are tired because you cannot find a job or you are stuck in your current job but you really want a big career in Tech

let's continue and build our application the first thing that our application should do is it should ask the user to select the language so I will say console. right line and here I will say please select the language okay and then below we are going to write all of the languages that he can select so console do right line if he presses one that is English okay and then the second language was Hindi okay and then let's say third language is U okay and then I will add the remaining languages and then I will be back so we have French German Spanish Portuguese Turkish and balcan any of the balcon languages and now what we should do is we should give our user the option to enter his choice so one of these nine numbers or any number and then based on his choice we are going to greet him in one of these languages or if he selects some option that is not valid then we are going to tell him you entered invalid choice so now I would like to invite you to try and implement this program with the help of if else conditions which we have learned in the previous video that is going to be linked here and also in the description in case that you did not watch it so make sure to watch it and then try to implement this program with the help of if else conditions and then I'm going to show you a better way to implement that same thing with the help of switch case the reason for that is because here we have a lot of different choices that the user can make and if you write a lot of if else conditions even if your program works the code will be hard to read hard to understand and maintain so a better choice is to implement this and to solve this problem with with the help of switch case so now I'm going to show you how you can do that so the first thing that we need to do is we need to read the choice that our user has entered and we will store that number inside an integer variable so let's create that variable let's say int Choice okay so what I want to do is whatever our user enters I want to parse that into integer so that it can be stored inside this integer variable so I will say int. pars console readline so I will read from the console what our user has entered and then I will parse that into an integer and store it inside this variable here and also please don't forget this semic column at the end so now that we have users Choice stored inside this variable what we want to do is we want to check which one of these numbers is inside this variable and then depending on that number we are going to write him a message in that specific language so the first thing that I will do is I will create a string variable I will call it message okay and initially I will not assign any value to this variable but what I will do is I will check what number is inside this Choice variable and then depending on that number I will store a message in one one of these nine languages and in order to check which value is inside this variable we are going to use switch case statement so switch case statement is used when you want to check what is the value of a certain variable but there are many different values that variable can hold for example in our case we have nine valid options nine valid cases and then our user can also enter an invalid number for example 15 so we should also be able to handle that situation as well and then in each one of these cases we want our program to behave differently we want to get a different message so for that we use switch case so let's see how would you do that so you write switch and then inside these parentheses you are going to put the variable whose value you want to check and that is our choice variable and then inside these curly brackets we will put all individual cases so in case that the user has entered number one which means that this variable holds number one then we will write a message in English in case that the user has entered number two so if this variable here holds number two then we will write a message in Hindi and then in case of three we will write a message in Ordo and so on so here I will describe each individual case so case one and then you put these two dots you put column sign so in this case message will be a message in English so I will say hello welcome okay and then one very important thing is that at the end of each case you need to put break statement so at the end of each case after you have finished describing what your program should do in that case you need to put break statement otherwise you are going to have errors okay so that is our case one now I'm going to copy this code and paste it and now I want to describe what is going to happen in case that the user has selected number two and in case of number two we need a message in Hindi so in Hindi I believe it is said Namaste okay I have a friend from India who always says Namaste and then does this what does that mean I find it so cute but I cannot do it right now so case number three is U we say asalam alaykum so case three and then message will be asalam alayum okay and then at the end of each case we need break okay so now I'm going to add these these remaining six languages and I will be back so I've added case four and that is French so in French we sayour Oren and then don't forget break at the end it's very important and then case five that is German so of and then again don't forget break at the end and then case six that is Spanish so we say um and then case seven is Portuguese so we say hola Bonia and then case eight that is Turkish so we sayaba hushen and then case nine I've put here Balon because that is actually my language it's a group of 10 languages which are very similar so in Balon we say okay so here we have have these nine cases and depending on which Choice which one of these nine numbers the user enters he is going to get one of these nine messages so now that we have stored one of these nine messages into this variable what we can do is we can simply write this message into our console but one thing that we need to do before that is we need to cover default case which means what is going to happen in case that user does not enter any one of these valid choices for example he enters number 10 or 100 so that case is called default and I will put it here like this so you say default so what is going to happen in default case well I will store inside my message invalid Choice like this and at the end I will put break again so now that we have covered all of these valid cases and then also default case which means if the user enters some number that is not valid now I can say console. line message so now if I run my program let's see what we are going to get so it says please select the language and if I say five and press enter we get guten tag will come in and then if I start the application again and I say for example two it says Namaste okay and then our default case is going to happen if I enter some choice that is not valid for example 57 and I press enter as you can see we get invalid Choice okay so the main takeaway from this video is that we use switch case statement when we want to execute different block of code depending on a value of a certain variable in our case we want to check what is value inside Choice variable and then in case it is one we want to execute this code in case it is do we want to execute this code and so on and then at the end of each case please don't forget to put break that is very important okay and then here we have default case which means if neither one of these is the value for this variable then we are going to execute default case okay and for each case you can have just one line of code or you can have an entire block of code depending on what you want your program to do uh in all of our cases we have just one line of code but again if you wanted you could put an entire block of code and then very very important not to forget is that at the end of each case you need to put break statement an interesting question is do you need to have this default case so does every switch case statement need to have default as well and the answer is no you don't so this here is not obligatory I can delete it but in our program we are going to get an error here and the reason why we are getting this error is because we are trying to write this message and that is going to work without any problems in case that user enters one of these nine numbers but if he enters any other number which is not not valid case then we are going to have an error because we have not assigned any value to that variable so here our program says that this variable needs to have some value in case that the user does not enter one of these nine numbers and so far we have covered that with our default situation but now that we don't have it what we can do is we can assign initial value here so initially I can say in valid choice so that is going to be initial value of this variable and then in case that the user enters one of these numbers we will simply change that for one of these messages and then in case that he enters something that is not valid then we will have this initial message so we will not have the error anymore and now if I start my program again as you can see our program works without any problems so one it says hello welcome and then if I enter something that is not valid for example 55 as you can see we get this invalid Choice which is the initial string that we have stored inside this variable so you can use this approach here or you can have default case at the end whichever you prefer most beginners find this one easier to understand so I will leave this one and even if you leave both your program is still going to work but it is redundant to have both so I will simply remove this initial message here okay so now that you have learned what is switch case and how to use it I want to give you a task that you can do on your own in order to practice and then you can watch my solution so your task is the following I want you to ask the user to enter a number for a month so one for January two for February three for March and so on and then depending on the number that he has entered you are going to write him a message how many days that month has so please pause the video here and then try to implement this try to solve this problem on your own and then you can watch my solution so here is my solution and I wanted to show you this example because I wanted to teach you an important and interesting trick and that is how you can group multiple cases together so here I have grouped these seven cases that have the same behavior so I have grouped them like this so that I don't have to repeat my code and then I have also grouped these four cases together because they also have the same behavior and I will explain this in a minute but first let's explain from the beginning what this program does so first we ask the user to enter a month so enter a number between 1 and 12 and then we read what the user has typed and we parse that into an integer so we convert it into an integer and we store it inside this month variable and then we switch on that variable which means we check what is the value of that variable so in case that it is one or in case that it is three or five 7 8 10 or 12 those are these months here and in any one of these cases we will print the same message so we will write that month has 31 days and then at the end we need to put break now another way that you could do this is you could repeat this code for all of these individual cases so you can say case one and then this code here and then case three and then the same code and then case five the same code again and so on but you can also do it this way in order to make your code shorter and understandable and in order to avoid repeating your code so for any one of these cases we will write this message here and then at the end very important to put break and then we have these four cases which also have the same behavior so in case that month is April or June or September or November so in case four 6 9 or 11 is what user has typed we are going to write this message that month has 30 days and then again it's very important that you put break and then since February is very specific we have just one month inside this group so in case of two we will say that month has 28 or 29 days on leap year and then again you need to to put break at the end and then we also have this default case which says invalid month so in case that the user enters any other number which is not between 1 and 12 we will write this message here okay so now if I start the program and I enter for example 10 that is October we get this message here that month has 31 days and then if I start the program again and I enter for example 9 that is September we should get this message here so that month has 30 days and then for February if we enter two we get this message here and then let me stop this program in case that I enter anything else which is not valid for example 99 we get invalid month message okay so this is how you use switch case and as I said in the beginning all of the problems that you can solve with switch case you can also solve with multiple if else conditions but sometimes if you write a lot of if else conditions that can make your code look bulky and hard to understand hard to maintain so if you need to write a lot of f Els conditions you should definitely consider using switch case instead but there are some important differences between if else statement and switch case statement and that is the following inside if else you can write different conditions and different different expressions for example you can say if a is greater than b then do something or if month is less than five then do this but in switch case you cannot do that so here inside each one of these cases you need to put exact value that this variable here can have and you cannot write expressions like you can in if else statement so that means that if else statement is more powerful it gives you more options but sometimes it is better to use switch case if you can of course because that will make your code easier to understand and easier to read for example if you need to write multiple if else statements then it is better to use switch case but that is possible only if you are checking the value of this variable against specific exact values that it can have and not some Expressions but if you just want to check one or two different values then it is completely okay and it is better and faster to write if else statement so if you don't understand F else then you can watch video that will be linked here and I will also put it in the description and then you can better understand what is if else and also the difference between switch case statement and if else statement so I hope that this video was helpful and that now you understand how to use switch case statement if you enjoyed it and if you want more videos like this give it a thumbs up and also if you
