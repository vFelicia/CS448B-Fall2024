hi guys and welcome to my channel this is going to be introduction to C programming language so in this video you are going to learn what is C what kind of applications we can build with C what is the difference between C and other programming languages and together we are going to build your first C application so I decided to divide this video into two parts the first part will be shorter and we are going to talk about some general stuff that is important related to C and then in the second part of the video we will install the tool that we need to write C applications and then together we are going to create your first C application and if you would like to learn practical programming I have an entire C practical programming course which is beginner friendly it's step by step everything is on one place from beginner to expert in the course we will focus on building real world applications so that you can get all of the programming skills and practical experience that you need to build the applications that you want and also you will get career ready skills so in this course I'm going to share over 10 years of my experience in a beginner friendly way so that you can also start building applications on your own in as little as 3 months you will also get access to an exclusive community of developers so that in this process of learning You Are Not Alone lost or confused because if if you have a question there will always be someone to help you very fast so that you can progress in an optimal way and the first 100 people who sign up using the link in the description will get a special discount so if you want to learn practical programming and start building real applications click the link and you can start your transformation from beginner to expert developer immediately so with that being said let's go to the topic of this video so the first question that I want to answer is what is c c is very powerful and verstile programming language it is developed by Microsoft and it is very very popular you can use it to build many different types of applications you can build modern desktop applications mobile applications games simple websites very big complex applications and so much more uh it is beginner friendly which means that it is suitable to learn as your first programming langu anguage but also if you already know another programming language like maybe C++ Java JavaScript Python and so on that knowledge will definitely help you because C is very similar to many other programming languages now I'm sure that as a beginner you probably heard about many different programming languages so now you are wondering which one is the best and which one you should pick um I want you to understand that programming languages are very similar in what way well when you learn one programming language then you start seeing patterns in other programming languages so it becomes very easy to switch to another programming language much easier than to learn your first programming language the same way that uh when you learn to drive a car and then you buy another car it is not going to be as hard to switch to that other car because you already know how to drive it will just take you a few days to get used to the new car so it's the same with programming languages but with that being said they are also very different because they have different purpose as I said with C you can build most of the modern applications that you and me are using every day so modern desktop applications mobile applications games websites and so on that is the purpose of C but if you want to build um let's say devices that are very close to Hardware maybe devices that have very limited resour sources like memory and processing power such as different sensors in automobiles um cars um and then different medical devices like pacemakers heart monitors and things like that or some security systems like smart door locks or security cameras and things like that then you wouldn't choose C because there are other languages which are better for thatt so what are some other benefits of c c is modern programming language it is very fast it is very clean and organized which makes it very beginner friendly easy to understand and learn for beginners also demand for C developers is very very high a lot of companies are looking for C developers to build different applications games and other cool software Al so if you decide to learn C you will definitely have a lot of job opportunities with C you can build all kinds of things as I already said from very small simple websites to very big complex applications and the main benefit is that c is crossplatform which means that your applications can work on Windows Mac and Linux operating systems c community is huge and it is usually very helpful which means that if you ever encounter a problem and you need help most likely there is someone out there who has already faced the same problem and he solved it so you can always find help uh and probably you will find that help on stack Overflow which is like developers online Bible you will see when it comes to learning C is beginner friendly which means that you can start learning and Building Things right away so you can immediately apply your knowledge and as an example of that I'm going to link a video here and also in the description and in that video we we are building a real useful application in a simple and easy way with C so if you want to check that out the link will be in the description now in order to write C code and create applications you need a tool for that and my recommendation is to install Visual Studio IDE IDE stands for integrated development environment and it means that it has everything that you need to create applications so we have a place to write code we can start our application we can debug which means we can discover and fix bugs and a lot more and the best part is that Community version is completely free and it is enough to build any kind of application that you want so my recommendation is to install Visual Studio 2022 it's completely free and now I'm going to show you where you can download it and how to install it so go to Google and type Visual Studio 2022 community and click on this official Microsoft link okay go to downloads and here you are going to download Community version because it is free okay save and here is my installer file so I'm going to click on that click on run and here we get Visual Studio installer so click on continue the installation process is very simple it's mostly next next finish so let's wait for this to install okay and here you are going to select net desktop development that is going to be enough for what we need to build C applications but as you can see there are many other things that you can do with Visual Studio but for us this one is going to be enough so click on install and now we are going to wait for a few minutes for this to be installed the installation process is finished and now it recommends that we should restart our computer for some of you it might work without restarting but just to be sure I recommend that you restart your computer and then we will continue so I will restart mine and then I'll be back so start your visual studio and here we are going to create our first project so click on create a new project okay it's loading everything and the type of application that I want to build is C console application if you cannot see it here you can search it so type c console app okay it is this one here and please make sure that it is C and not Visual Basic or some other language and also as I told you it is crossplatform as you can see here so this application is going to work on Linux Mac and windows so let's select that and click on next okay and here we are going to give the name to our application let's call it my first app everything should be together so my first app and click on next okay and here we are choosing framework you can leave this as it is so just click on create okay and now it is creating everything that we need for our application so this is what we will get when the project is created and this that you can see here is already functional small application so now I'm going to run it so that you can see how it looks like and then we are going to explain how this works so in order to start the application you can press on this little play button or you can go to debug and click on start debugging or press F5 on your keyboard whichever you prefer so click on this and now the application is going to start okay as you can see this is the application that we have it says hello world and then this here is some junk text that is generated by visual studio and at the end it says press any key to close this window so if I press any key it is going to close the console now as I said the black window that you just saw is called console and that is exactly what our application does it says in the console I'm going to write the following line and that line is this text here so this command here will write this line of text in our console and this is your first C program now if I want to write something else I will simply change this text here so let's say like this video wink wink okay and I'm going to start my program and as you can see we get this text in our cont console now there are a few more things that I want to explain so let's close this program okay this symbol here semicolon is a symbol that you use to end each command so this is one command and to tell to your computer hey here is the end of the command you put this symbol okay and then this here is a comment and you can write comments in the code for yourself or other developers so that you can better understand and remember what a certain line of code does for example here we can say to learn practical programming visit code Beauty academy.com now please notice the difference between this text here and this text here this here is a comment which means that you can put anything that you want you can write any text that you want and as long as you put it under a comment which you do by writing two slash symbols you will not have any problems but this here is CP code which means that you need to follow C syntax otherwise you are going to have errors for example if I put here two dots instead of one we are going to get an error because this here is not valid C syntax so let's delete that and the error will disappear and then here as I said because this here is a comment you you can write anything that you want but just make sure that you add two SL symbols in front of it another important part is this part here it's called solution Explorer and if you cannot see it go to view and here you should find solution Explorer it is here so click on that and you should be able to see solution Explorer and as you can see here we have program.cs which is the file where we will be writing C code now there are many more important and interesting things that we will learn in the upcoming videos and just one last that I want to show you is in case that you make any mistake or any error you can go to view and then click on error list and here you should see all of the errors that you have in your program right now we have zero errors but if I click here let's say I add another dot as you can see here we get three errors just by adding one simple dot okay so let's delete that and the errors should disappear okay now one more thing that I want to show you before I end this video is for some of you this code might look like this and it is absolutely the same thing this program is going to do absolutely the same thing as the previous one here it just says that we have a class called program which is this file here where we are writing our code and then this here is main function and if you already learned any other programming language you know that any program starts its execution from the main function which means that the first line that will be executed in your program is the first line of your main function and that is this line here so if I run this program we will get absolutely the same result as the previous okay as you can see it says like this video so I believe it is going to be enough for this lesson in the next lesson we will write more code and I will teach you how to create some really cool apps so if you enjoyed this video and if you learned something new please give it a big thumbs up also if you have any questions leave those in the comment section so that I can reply to your comment or I can make a dedicated video about that specific topic that you ask about and if you
