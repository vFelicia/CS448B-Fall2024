if you're a senior developer someone who's experienced and you are not receiving job offers or you are applying for positions but they constantly reject you I'm sorry to break it to you but you are just not that good you've been too comfortable for too long closed in your little bubble which made you think that you are really great which you're not it's not AI it's not the government it's you how do I know this because I am still receiving job offers today I counted 86 of them since the beginning of the year and it's now July 13th when I'm filming this all of the developers are around me who I consider to be good developers are still receiving great job offers if you're a senior experienced developer then you are just not really that good things have changed and while you've been too comfortable and resting you didn't notice that some people have been very busy and working hard if you're a junior developer the situation is a little bit different because you either don't have a good reference or you don't know how to stand out among other people or even if you get a chance and get a job interview you screw it up because you don't know what to do
