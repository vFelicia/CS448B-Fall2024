hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up visual studio code and everything that you need to install in order to build C applications with vs code the first thing that I want to explain is that vs code is a text editor it is free it is lightweight and if your computer is not that good but you still want to learn coding maybe you want to follow some of my C programming videos here on YouTube then vs code is going to be enough for you and in this video I will show you how you can set it up and everything that you need to install all of the extensions so that you can build C applications with vs code on the other hand there are some other tools like visual studio and visual studio is also free for you as a student and visual studio is a lot more powerful than vs code Visual Studio is an IDE which means integrated development environment and that means that it contains everything that you need to have in order to build applications in order to debug which means to discover and fix bugs in your applications different diagnostic tools that are going to help you to optimize your applications everything that you need in order to deploy your applications and so on so visual studio is a lot more powerful than vs code and also you can use it in order to build applications not just in C but many other programming languages as well but if you're just beginner and you first want to write some code and see if you really like it or not before you decide to invest in a better computer that is is more expensive then vs code is going to be more than enough for you and in this video I will show you how you can set up everything so that you can use vs code in order to make C applications I make a lot of C videos here on YouTube you can check out my C for beginners playlist I will link it in the description and in those videos you are going to learn a lot of important programming Concepts and for most of those videos VSS code is going to be enough but for those of you who want to speed up your progress and who want to get a job as soon as possible I also have a mentorship program which is practical programming course where you can get help directly from me we are going to work on real projects and at the end of the course you are going to get the knowledge and the certificate that you need in order to get your first job as a software developer we have a lot of students who started just three or four months ago and they already got their first job and when they started they were complete beginners so all the questions that you have will will be answered by experienced developers people who have been coding for years including myself this course is paid course so it is only for serious people who really want to work and who want to see serious results of their work salaries in IT industry are three times higher than any other industry so the competition is tough and you really need to work hard and you need to be prepared if you want to stand out among other people so if you want to use this opportunity I'm going to leave a coupon code that you can use to get a discount when you enroll in the course and also we have a 7Day money back guarantee which means that if for any reason you don't like the course you can get all of your money back no questions asked so this is for people who want to learn practical programming and start career as soon as possible and then in this video I will teach you how you can install and set up vs code so that you can build C applications and start learning programming the first thing that you will need is to download and install vs code you can do that on the official Microsoft website please use this link I will put it in the description so that you don't have to type it manually okay so here we can download vs code I will click on this button here so download for Windows okay and here it is asking me to save this installer file so click on Save okay and now we are waiting for the download process to finish okay so download process just finished and here I have my installer file so now we are going to install vs code and the installation process is very simple mostly next next next finish so let's double click here I will click on run and then I will accept these terms and agreements and then click on next and then next again next again and here I'm going to check these two options as well so all of these four options are checked they are going to be useful for you later when you learn more about coding so let's install them up front so select these four options and click on next okay and then here I will click on install and now we are waiting for the installation process to finish okay so the installation process is finished and now you can click on finish and it should launch Visual Studio code okay so here is our VSS code and if it did not start for you automatically you can open it manually just click on this start icon and type Visual Studio code and you can run it by clicking on this icon okay so the first thing that I want to do is to change this light theme into Dark theme and this is completely optional you don't have to do this if you like this theme but for me this is too bright and it is hurting my eyes and I believe that for most of you it's the same so let's change this light theme into Dark theme go to file and here you are going to find references theme color team okay and here we are going to select one of these dark teams the one that I like is this one dark visual studio so click on that okay and as you can see now it's much better it's much easier on the eyes so we have installed vs code which was the first step the second step and the second thing that we will need is to install net SDK and this is a set of tools that is developed by Microsoft and we are going to to use this set of tools in order to build C applications so now we need to install it you can open your Google once more and you can use this link in order to download net SDK I will put this link in the description so that you don't have to retype it okay so open this link okay and here you need to download latest version of net um now at the moment of filming this video that is net 8.0 so let's download that click here okay and then save and now we are waiting for the download process to finish so once it is downloaded you should have this installation file and now we are going to run the installation it's going to be very easy nothing special so mostly next next finish so let's double click on this installation file click on run and here click on install and now we are waiting for the installation to finish so the installation was successful and here you can click close now just to make sure that everything was installed successfully I will teach you two commands that you can use in order to check that so press on this Windows button and type CMD and open this command prompt okay and here you can type the First Command that is going to tell you which SDK versions you have installed on your computer so type net Das Dash list sdks so please give me the list of all of the sdks that are installed and here you can see that in my computer I have four if you did not install any NET Framework before then you should have only one the one that you have just installed so in order to check which one you are currently using type this command net D version like this and it is going to give you the current version of NET Framework that you are using and that is the one that we have just installed okay this is great it means that everything was installed successfully so now we can go back to our Visual Studio code so here and here we will need to install a few extensions so that we can start building C applications with vs code so let's install the extensions that we need click on view extension and here we are going to search for the extensions that we need please type c dev kit like this and the extension that you need is this one so C dev kit please make sure that it is official extension by Microsoft so you will click on install for this extension and now we are waiting for the installation process to finish so the installation process is finished and now we should have have this extension and also a few more extensions that were installed with it so please delete this search term and here you should see these four extensions make sure that you have here in this list of installed extensions following four extensions you need net install tool that is official extension by Microsoft and then CP extension Again official by Microsoft and then C devkit Again official by Microsoft and then all of these other extensions that I have those are for some other work that I'm doing and you absolutely don't need them so you need these three Net install tool C and C devkit and then you need one more which was not installed for me maybe it was installed for you but no problem I will show you how you can add that one manually so the one that we need to add is intell code for C devkit like this okay so I will need to install this extension and again if you are installing it as well if you don't have it uh please make sure that it is Microsoft official extension so click on install here and it should be added okay now we are waiting so with this all of the extensions have been installed for me I will delete this search term once more to make sure that I have all four so we need net install tool We need c We need c dev kit and then we need intell code for C dev kit make sure that you have all four of these and if you don't have one of these you will have to install it manually so once you have all four of these we can proceed and start building C applications so let me show you how to build your first C application with VSS code click on view and then command palette or you can press contrl shift and P okay and here I will type net new project so select this option okay now we need to wait because we are creating this for the first time here you will get a list of most common templates and the one that we need is console app so you can find it in this list or you can search it manually so console app and click on this one and now you will be asked where you want to save this project for me let's say that I will save it on desktop okay select folder and now it is asking me to give the name to my application so let's say my first vs code console app okay and hit enter and now simply click create project okay and now we are waiting for the project to be created and here I will click yes I trust the author because author is me so I will click here and here on this left side we have our project so now I will show you how you can create a simple C application so now the question is where are we going to write the code well let's collapse this and let's open this expander here solution Explorer okay and here you should have this my first VSS code console application so under this you should have program.cs and that is the file where we are going to write the code so if you double click on this program.cs you should get a file that looks like this so here we already have this simple hello world program so if I hit F5 this program should start and here it is asking me first to select the debugger so I will click on this one so C okay and I will launch this application and now I'm waiting for this output in my console and as you can see it we have here hello world which is the result of this code that we have in our program.cs so if I want to print something else I will just change the text inside these quotation marks so let's say for example learn practical programming at code Beauty academy.com and then I simply hit F5 and the application should start okay and we have our output here and then let's say for example that you want to ask the user to enter his input let's see how we can do that let's first declare a variable of type string and let's call it name okay and then what I want to do is I want to say console. right line and I want to say here here please enter your name like this and then inside this name variable I want to read whatever the user has typed into the console so console. readline please make sure that you are using correct capital or lowercase letters so console. readline and then after the user has entered his name I will simply say again console right line and here I will say hello and let's also add the name that the user has entered like this so now I will simply hit F5 and our application should start so here it says please enter your name so you are going to enter your name in this prompt here so here I will enter my name that is Salina like this and if I press enter as you can see the application responds with hello Saina okay so I hope that you have enjoyed this video all of the links for all the tools that we have installed in this video will be in the description I will prepare everything for you uh so now you can start learning C and you can start watching my C for beginners playlist and learn how to actually build C applications and if you want
