hi guys welcome to my channel in today's video I wanted to show you something that you are going to be using very often if you start on a programming path and that is if else statements so what is FL statement well if statement is something that is used when you want to execute part of your code so block of your code conditionally which means not always but only in a certain situation and then if you add else block to that that else block is going to be executed otherwise so in the situation where your F block is not executed your else is going to be executed so let me explain that to you in a simple example here I have opened my visual studio and let's quickly paste an exercise that we are going to do in this tutorial and that is this task here so let's say that our user has to enter a number a whole number integer number and then after that our program has to check whether that number is even or odd and has to write out that to our user so how we are going to solve this problem here well I'm going to explain this to you using diagrams because I believe that that is the best way for you to understand this if you haven't used this ifelse statement before and then what we are going to do after we understand those diagrams well we are literally going to just translate that diagram into our C++ code so let me open my tool so here I have opened a tool that I'm going to be using for drawing diagrams it's called blank diagram you can use whatever tool you want you can use even a paint or a pen and paper if you want that will work as well so here I'm going to draw the flowchart of our program so how our program is going to be executed now let me add first here the shape and we are going to say that this is going to be the start of our program so I'm going to write out start and this indicates our main function let's say the first line of our main function so here our program start and then as we said in our task in our exercise our user has to enter an integer number and the shape that we are going to be using for that is this shape here so let me put this shape here and I'm going to write a text inside and I'm going to say int number so this shape here indicates that our user is going to enter some data in our program and what I'm using this shape because it looks like this it looks like a funnel so you can clearly visualize that something has to enter inside that shape so something has to be inputted in your program so I'm going to use this shape for that and then I'm going to say that our user has to enter an integer number which I'm going to call number so that variable I'm going to call number and what's quickly this arrow so that we know that this is the flow of our program so after it has started our user enters a number and then after that what we have to do is our program has to decide whether that number that user has entered is even number or odd number so how we are going to do that well the shape that I'm going to be using for that decision let me find it well it is this shape here so this diamond shape and as you can see it says decision on it so that's the shape that we are going to be using and inside this shape here I'm going to write a condition so as you can see our program flows this way and after it comes here as you can see it has one entry point and then it it can have multiple multiple flows that it can go to depending on this condition that we are going to put inside here but how we are going to decide whether that number that our user has entered is even or odd let me very quickly open my visual studio once more it is here and let me show you something I want to introduce you to an operator that is called modulo and that is used to show what is the remainder of dividing two whole numbers so I'm going to break out out and then what I'm going to write out is let's say 2 modulo 2 so this operator here gives you the remainder of dividing these two numbers and in this situation we are expecting to see a 0 because 2 divided by 2 is 1 and then what remains after that operation is 0 and that what remains should be should be shown when we use this operator here so if I run my program you can see that we have gotten the expected result so we have gotten 0 here but let me show you what happens if I enter for example 5 well what we are going to get is 1 because 5 divided by 2 is going to be 2 and then that one that remains we can get using this operator and you see that it gives us the expected result so 5 modulo 2 is equal to 1 so this operator here is what we are going to be using to determine whether our user has entered even number or odd number because when we get the result of modulating two numbers when our result is 1 that means that our user has entered odd number and if we get 0 as a result of this operation that means that our user has entered even number so I'm going to switch again to my diagram and then inside this decision here we are going to be writing we are going to write this condition here so I'm going to say number modulo 2 is equal to 0 so what this means it means that after a program has started and our user has entered the number that he wants an integer number we are coming to a decision point where we have to decide whether this number that he has entered after you modulate it with 0 whether it's a 0 remainder or some other remainder so in this situation when this is 0 we are going to execute a certain part of code and then let me add very quickly oh I'm impressed it already has this yes inside it and then we also have the snow on this on your line so in this situation where this results as the operation that is true we are going to execute this part code here so I'm going to add another shape which I cannot see but let me use this shape once more and I'm only going to rotate this shape like this and I'm going to delete this text and what we are going to be using this shape here for is to indicate that we are going to output something from our program so it looks like this which is clearly a visual of something is going to be outputted from it so it is just reverse of death shape here this funnel shape and then inside this shape let me write a text which is going to be let's say that in the case that this here results as a yes as a true operation so our number when it's modulated by 2 it gives a 0 remainder we are going to say that that number is even number so we are going to write that out to our user and then and the situation where this here results as a no so as the operation that is false let me write out that here and I'm going to say to our user so I'm going to write out my user that he has entered odd number and let's just join this here like this okay so our user enters a number then we decide if that number modulated by 2 gives us 0 and if yes we are going to write out our user that that is an even number if no we are going to write out our user that that number is odd number and this is here really our program what I'm going to add is let's say that after this our program is going to stop so I'm going to say here that this is the end my program like this and let's add one more stop of this flow here so in both of these situations after we have and after we have output it to our user the result of this program our program is going to stop and this here really like these two stop points look a bit ugly to me so what I'm going to do instead of this I'm going to delete this you could have as well left it like that like like it was before but what I'm going to add I'm going to add one more of these diamond shapes only this time is going to be smaller and I'm going to say that in this situation it is going to be used only to say that this decision here this this decision flow is going to be joined in this point here so like this I'm going to say whatever has happened whether this block of code or this block of code it has come to an end here and then after that from here I'm going to say now my program is going to stop like this and this let me remove this yes and this is going to be the flowchart of our program so our program starts that our user enters integer number then we decide whether that number modulated by 2 is going to give us 0 if yes we execute this else we execute this so if this is no and then we come to this which joints are a 2 but and then we can say that our program has ended and now let's translate this to our code here I have opened both my visual studio and also I have exported this diagram so that we can translate it literally we can look at this diagram and then translate that into code so now I'm going to delete all of this that we have written inside our visual studio and I'm going to look at this picture and just translate it into C++ commands so the first this first shape here says that user is going to enter integer number inside our program and we are to call that variable a number so I'm going to say int number and then this here this funnel shape really translates into C in command so user enters something inside our program and let us see in command and I'm going to say that user is going to enter a number before this I would like to add one more information to our user so that he knows what he should enter you could have as well put that to our diagram but I didn't want it to make that diagram crowded so I didn't but what we are going to add here is C out and then say please enter whole number like this so we write out the message our user and after that our user as you can see here enters integer number we had also to declare this int number variable because you can enter the value only for variables that you have previously declared and then after that our program comes to this decision point and how we can represent this decision inside our code is using if statement so we are going to write here F and then I'm going to put this condition here inside these parentheses so I'm going to say if number modulo two equals zero this here is operator of equals so whether this side is equal to this side since only one of these so like this this operator here is used to assign value to a variable so that was already taken so this here two of these signs are used to check equality of these two sides so whether this is equal to this and then what I'm going to say as you can see from my diagram here we check this condition here and if this condition is true if this condition is yes we are going to execute a certain block of code and that is this code here and how you indicate a block of code in your C++ is using these phrases here like this so this is your block of code that is going to be executed in this yes situation and then in case that this no here happens so in case that this results as false you are going to execute another block of code and we represent that block of code using else statement so we are going to say if this here is true execute one block of code else if this here is false execute another block of code so here what are if makes us do well it says that we only have to write out our user that he has entered even number because this shape here as you can see it looks like this and it represents that something should be outputted from your program so we are going to use for that our C out command so C out you have entered even number so like this and let's add a line so in case that this here result is true we are going to output to our user that he has entered even number else if this here results as false we are going to output to our user let me copy this like this and we are going to change that only to odd so in case that this here results as false we are going to output you have entered odd number so either this here is going to be executed or it does here depending on this condition and you can see that from diarrheal the diagram clearly so when your program comes to this decision point it checks this condition and if the answer is true or yes it is going to execute this else if the answer is no it is going to execute this and then after that it really just joins these two flows and then that s D that is the stop point of your program so we can write here C out thanks bye okay let's say that that is the last line of our program you don't I haven't put this on on my diagram right okay so I'm going to run my program now and as you can see it says please enter a whole number so this line here and if I enter for example eight it is going to come to this line here and it is going to modulate our eight with two and if the result is zero which it is it is going to execute this line here and right out you have entered even number oh thanks we are missing an S here and then it writes out thanks bye and let me add an S here okay and if I run my program again as you can see it asked me asks me again to enter a number and this time I'm going to enter five which we know that is an odd number it says you have entered an odd number because it has come to this decision point here it has tried to modulate five with two and the result of that was not zero so it has not executed this but it has executed this else statement and it has written you have entered odd number as you can see here and then this thanks bye okay so I hope that you have understood this and if you like me to use these diagrams to explain some more code that we are going to be using you can write that in a comments down below and I'm going to try to use more of these diagrams because I know that some people understand it better when there is a visual representation of your code I was one of those people when I first started learning programming so if you find it easier to understand when I use these diagrams I'm going to be using that so thanks for watching this video make sure to like it if you find it any helpful and also to subscribe to my channel and I'm going to see you in my next video
