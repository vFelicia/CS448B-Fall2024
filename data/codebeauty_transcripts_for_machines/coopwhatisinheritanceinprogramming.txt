hi everyone my name is saldina and i make i.t and programming related videos on my channel so if that is something that is of interest to you consider subscribing and give this video a thumbs up as well and in this particular video i want to talk about inheritance so here i have my visual studio and here i have some code that we have written in the previous tutorials of this course so if you haven't watched those make sure to watch them the links are going to be in the description of this video and now i'm going to go very quickly over the code that we have here so i have created a class that is called youtube channel and that class has four private properties name owner name subscribers count and then published video titles and then we have a couple of public methods as well we have a constructor which just assigns initializes these variables here and then we have getinfo method that just writes out information values that are stored inside these properties here and then as well we have subscribe and unsubscribe methods our subscribe method increases our subscribers counter and then our unsubscribe method decreases that subscribers counter but first we have to check if that subscriber's count is greater than zero so those would be subscribe and unsubscribe methods and then we have this publish video method as well that just adds a new item adds a new title to this published videos list okay now what is going to happen if i want to create another type of youtube channel a specific type of youtube channel which is going to be for example um cooking youtube channel so i should copy these properties right well that can be one approach but the quicker and better approach is going to be to inherit this youtube channel class so let's do that let's create another type of channel so let's create another class let's say class and then let's call it cooking youtube channel like this okay now i have created a class that is called cooking youtube channel and in order to inherit this youtube channel class what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this column sign and then i'm going to say public youtube channel like this and in this way my cooking youtube channel is going to inherit my youtube channel and that means that my cooking youtube channel is going to have everything that my youtube channel has now this public access modifier means that whatever is public in this class here it is going to be public here as well so in this derived class and one very important thing is to know that this class is called base class so the one that you inherit from that is base class and then the derived class is going to be this one here so the one that inherits from the base class is called derived class and in this particular situation our cooking youtube channel is derived class now what is going to happen if i want to create for example an object of this cooking youtube channel so i'm going to say cooking youtube channel and let's call it youtube channel like this okay now as you can see it says that default constructor of cooking youtube channel cannot be referenced now that is because we do not have a constructor for this class here so let's create one let's create a constructor so i'm going to copy this name and then add these parentheses okay and now if i hover over this it says that the constructor is inaccessible so we still have an error but we have a different error which means that we are making progress so because this constructor is inaccessible i will have to make it public to make it accessible outside of this class here so i'm going to say public okay and now my constructor is going to be accessible but there is another thing that we have to do and that is going to be inside this constructor we have to receive properties that we are going to initialize in our constructor and those are going to be these two properties name and owner name so here i'm going to say that my constructor receives two properties so string name and then string owner name so the owner of that channel and what i'm going to do when i receive these two properties i'm not going to initialize them here in my constructor because i'm inheriting from a class that already knows how to construct how to initialize these two particular properties so i'm going to call the constructor of that class so i'm going to call the constructor of this youtube channel class so here i'm going to put this column sign and then i'm going to invoke its constructor so i'm going to say youtube channel and then i will pass these two parameters here so i'm going to say name and then owner name like this and now our base class our youtube channel class is going to construct to initialize actually the value of these two properties and as you can see here we have an error that asks us to pass these two values to our constructor so we are going to pass two parameters the first one is going to be the name of our channel so let's say that that is going to be for example amy's kitchen like this and then owner is going to be um girl named amy let's put that here as well okay now after i have created an object of this cooking youtube channel what i should be able to do is i should be able to access all of these public methods that my base class has so all of these methods from my youtube channel class should be available for my uh cooking youtube channel so here i'm going to say youtube channel dot and then as you can see these are available so get info publish video subscribe unsubscribe let's write out info about my channel like this and if i run it now well you can see that we have amy's amy's kitchen channel owner is amy it has zero subscribers and it has no videos as well so let's publish a couple of videos for amy amy's kitchen channel so here i'm going to say okay before it does get info function i'm going to say youtube channel dot and then let's say publish video of for example apple pie like this and then let's publish another video let's say for example chocolate cake like this and now if i run this program as you can see we have oh we have two videos and let's as well say that people like these videos so they decide to subscribe to amy's kitchen channel so i'm going to say youtube channel dot subscribe so for example two people decide to subscribe to her channel and if i run my program again you can see that now we have two subscribers as well so we have been able to invoke all of these methods that are implemented in our base class so here from the object of our derived class so from the object of this derived class here now this derived class this cooking youtube channel can have its own members meaning things that are specific for this class only so let's say for example that we want to create a method that is going to be called uh for example practice so i'm going to say void practice like this and then what this method should do it should just make our user that has this cooking youtube channel it should say that this user is practicing cooking and then learning new recipes and things like that so i'm going to say c out like this and that let me copy this part of the code because i don't want to make a typo like this so it says that our youtube channel's user is practicing cooking learning new recipes and then experimenting with spices because i guess that's something that you should do if you have a cooking youtube channel and let me add endline here as well like this so now if i decide to invoke this method this method is going to be available only for objects of this cooking youtube channel so i'm going to say youtube channel like this and then let's say practice like this now um let me very quickly change the name of this youtube channel object because i want to create another object that is going to be off uh this youtube channel type and i want to call that youtube channel so here i'm going to say um cooking youtube channel and i'm going to paste that name here and then here and here here as well okay now we have named this object cooking youtube channel and if i run this program you can see that at the end it says practicing cooking learning new recipes experimenting with spices now as i already said this practice method should be available only for the objects of this cooking youtube channel class so that means if i decide to create an object of this class here this base class that class is not going to have this practice method and let's prove that very quickly so here i'm going to create an object of youtube channel class type and let's call that object youtube channel that's why i changed the name of this object like this and let's say that that is going to be my channel for example code beauty like this and then let's say that owner is my name salvina so now if i try to access this practice method on my youtube channel so i press dot you can see that that method is not available for this base class it is available only for this cooking youtube channel class because this practice is very specific method meaning this cool beauty channel which is oriented to programming and i.t does not really benefit from learning um recipes and experimenting with spices practicing cooking and things like that so this channel should probably have some other way of practicing because it is different type of channel so i'm going to delete this code here okay and let's repeat this one more time so we have created a derived class which is called cooking youtube channel and we have inherited everything that our youtube channel class has by saying public and then the name of our base class and this public access modifier is going to allow us to have whatever is public here to have that public here as well and then we have created a constructor for our cooking youtube channel and in that constructor we receive two parameters name and owner name and since our base class constructor knows how to initialize those two we have here invoked this base class constructor and then here we have created as well a method that is called practice and that method just says that our user is practicing cooking and he is learning new recipes and experimenting with spices now there's one more thing that i want to show you and that is going to be to let's create another object of this cooking youtube channel and that is going to be let's say cooking youtube channel 2 and let's call it john's kitchen like this and owner is going to be for example john now what is going to happen if i say for example that this second youtube channel so this cooking youtube channel too john's youtube channel is practicing i'm going to um comment these two because i don't need them and if i run my program now you can see that it says two times practicing cooking learning new recipes experimenting with spices and then the same line here so you cannot really differentiate between which one is amy's channel and which one is john's channel so in order to make that a bit more understandable i'm going to add a property here so here i want to add the name of the owner of this channel so here i'm going to say let me copy this property like this so owner name and then let's say that that owner is practicing cooking learning new recipes experimenting with spices and so on but as you can see this this property here is not accessible it says that member owner name is inaccessible and why is that the case why is it inaccessible because it is private and if you remember private members can be accessed only within that class and then public members can be accessed from outside of that class but what happens if you want to have for example a certain property to be accessible in the derived class now there is an access modifier for that as well so that is going to be protected access modifier so i'm going to say here protected like this and then i'm going to move this owner name to my protected area like this so now this owner name property should be accessible in derived classes as well and as you can see the error has disappeared so now if i run my program you can see that it says that amy is practicing cooking learning new recipes and experimenting with spices and then this second line here says that john is practicing cooking and learning new recipes and experimenting with spices so now we have made a difference we have specified the name of our owner of the channel and we can understand what the code is doing a bit more i hope that you understood what is inheritance and how it works in c plus plus and if you did please like this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and click that bell icon as well and i'm going to see you in my next video bye
