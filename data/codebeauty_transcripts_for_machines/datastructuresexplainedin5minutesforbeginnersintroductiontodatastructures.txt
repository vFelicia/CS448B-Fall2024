hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is saldina i am a software engineer and i make programming related videos and in this video i want to talk about data structures this is going to be an introduction video so it's not really important if you are not already familiar with data structures if you never even heard of data structures because i am going to explain everything step by step and then in my following videos of this playlist we will see and focus on each individual data structure on its own so the first question that i want to answer is what are data structures well a data structure is just a collection of data so it is a collection of integers or characters or floats doubles or it can be some user defined type so classes and if you're not familiar with classes make sure to watch my object oriented programming course which i will link here and then in the description down below as well and it is a collection but it is an organized collection and it is organized in such way that it makes the process of working with that data accessing that data modifying it changing it it makes that process very fast and easy why do we need data structures we need them because without data structures our code would be much slower and then the process of working with our data would be much much harder so we organize that data into data structures and for this i want to give you an example that i am pretty sure every single one of you is going to understand so imagine the following situation you wake up in the morning and you are running late for work or for school so you need to get ready and you need to get dressed but you need to do that very very quickly so you look outside to check the weather or you check it on your smartphone and you realize that it is sunny outside so you decide that you will wear a tshirt pants and then socks and shoes and you will probably wear some accessories things like a wallet a watch sunglasses things like that but then you realize that your clothes is not organized so here is your clothes now my question for you is how are you going to find those things that you need in this pile of clothes and how long will it take so this is a rhetorical question and rather than answering this question i want to give you an alternative instead so imagine if your clothes were well structured and organized wouldn't it be much easier to access the clothes that you need in this situation so again as we said you need great tshirt blue jeans great shoes socks and then sunglasses watch and wallet and a jacket in case that the weather gets worse and you are ready literally in five minutes and yes you first need to invest some time to think about the best way to organize your clothes and maybe you need to learn a few tips and tricks on how to do that but later the process of you getting ready and accessing that close is much faster and this example is not just applicable to organizing your clothes because you probably have some other way that you use to organize your books for school and then there are ways to organize and structure streets in your town and then there is some other way to organize your posts your messages and photos on instagram and facebook and twitter and things like that and by the way you can follow me on instagram and twitter at at true code beauty salvina please put it here when editing so as i said you have different ways to organize different things in your real life and the same way in programming you would use a different data structure to organize data in different situations and some of the examples of those data structures that we will see in my following videos are an array a list a stack a queue a graph a hash table and so on and in my following videos i will dedicate that specific video to each individual data structure so that you can learn advantages and disadvantages of that data structure and then you will learn some rules and tips and when to use a specific data structure so if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up for the youtube algorithm by the way we will be talking about algorithms on this channel as well because those are closely related to data structures so if you don't want to miss any video that i publish uh you can subscribe to my channel and uh press the bell icon because then you will be notified when i publish my next video if you don't no problem uh thank you very much for watching and i am going to see you in my next video bye
