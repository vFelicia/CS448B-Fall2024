hi guys and welcome to my channnel in this video we are going to talk about array data structure and I will teach you how to work with arrays in C the best way to learn programming is through practical examples so in this video we are going to build an application together and that application is going to help us to track the calories that we are eating so that we can calculate if we are gaining weight or losing weight this is beginner friendly video so even if you don't know anything about aray this video is for you so let's go straight to the point and let's start building our application the first thing that you need to understand is the difference between a regular simple variable and an array so inside a regular normal variable you can store just one value but inside an array you can store multiple values so if you create an array of two elements you can store two values if you create an array of five elements you can store five values inside that array so my idea is to create an array that can hold seven decimal numbers so one number for each day of the week and inside each element of that array we are going to enter how many calories we have eaten for that day so let's see how we can do that so if I say here decimal weekly calories here I have created just one regular normal variable of type decimal and inside it I can store just one value but if you want to create an array what you need to do is here after the type you need to put these square brackets and by doing this what we have done is we have created an array of decimal numbers called weekly calories so inside this array we can put multiple values but all of those values need to be of this type here so all of them need to be decimal number numbers they can also be integers because our computer our compiler knows how to convert integer numbers into decimal numbers for example five is the same as 5.0 so that is going to be okay but what will not be okay is to put characters strings or some other types inside this array here so only decimal numbers so now the question is how can you put elements into this array here there are different ways to do that there are different ways to initialize this array and in this video I'm going to show you three most important and three most common ways to do that now before we go any further if you like my teaching style and if you like learning from my YouTube videos then you can definitely learn a lot more from my practical programming course you can find it on this site here code Beauty academy.com so what is the difference between my YouTube videos and my practical programming course the difference is that in my practical programming course in code Beauty Academy you will get everything that you need in order to learn programming and start a successful career as a software developer as soon as possible so we are going to work on real projects you will get all of the video lessons tasks exercises code and my personal mentorship and help so that you can get your first job as a software developer in just a few months this is only for people who are serious about learning programming and who really want to invest their time now in order to learn programming so that they can later see the benefits of their work a lot of students who used to watch my YouTube videos and then they decided to join the academy they were able to find their first job in just three or four months and you can also be one of them if you're willing to work hard and in case that you start the course but you don't like it for any reason just send an email in the first seven days and you will get all of your money back no questions asked so instead of coming up with excuses use the discount code that I will leave in the description and learn programming because I promise you it is the best thing that you can do for your future so let's continue with the video and let's talk about different ways to initialize this array so as we said inside an array we can put multiple values so now the question is how can we do that well you can initialize this array like this you use these curly brackets and then inside these curly brackets you will specify all of the values for each element of the array now this array is called weekly calories so my idea is to have seven elements so one for each day of the week and in those elements we will enter how many calories we have eaten for each day of the week so let's say that on Monday we started tracking calories and how much we eat so we consumed 25 00 calories according to plan according to our diet and our needs and then Tuesday was the same again and then let's say that on Wednesday was someone's birthday so we ate a bit more so let's say for example 285 okay and then Thursday we are back on track let's say 2550 okay and then Friday was maybe night out we had a dinner out so let's say 3050 okay and then Saturday was good and Sunday was cheat day so let's say 3 1 0 0 so this here is our calorie consumption for the week so each element of this array represents how many calories we have eaten that day and this is one way in order to initialize the array so you use these curly brackets in order to say that you will initialize the array and then you specify all of the ele elements of the array but you need to separate them with this comma sign and this array here has 1 2 3 four five six seven elements so each day is one Element and each element represents how many calories we have eaten in that day so this is one way to initialize your array and something important that I said is that all of these elements of the array need to be decimal numbers or in integer numbers because your computer knows how to convert integer number into decimal number but what you cannot do is for example you cannot have here a string because as you can see immediately you get this red squiggly which says hey this is string and I don't know how to convert it to decimal so once more they all need to be decimal numbers now something that I would like to change here is the following here we are hardcoding the values for each element of the array but what we want to do is we want to be able to ask our user hey how many calories have you eaten in the first day how many have you eaten for the second day third day and so on so that would be another way second way to initialize this array and in order to be able to do that we need to access each element of this array individually and set the value for that element so now the question is how can we do that so in order to put the values that our user enters inside each one of these elements of the array we need to be able to access them and we access these elements with the help of their index so what does that mean well each one of these elements of the array has its own index and those indexes start from zero which means that this first element has the index of zero and then the second element has the index of one and then third element has the index two and then three 4 five and six which means that an array that has seven elements its indexes go from zero to six and that is why it is often said that developers start counting from zero because the indexation of the array starts from zero as well so now that we know that each element of the array has its own index the question is how can we use that index in order to access a specific element so for example how can we access this first element of the array well we can do that by using the name of the array and then the index so here I will say weekly calories and then inside these squared brackets I will put the index so by doing this I am accessing the element of of this array that has index zero so that means the first element and now I can work with this first element I can read its value I can put some value inside it or I can perform some calculation and so on and what we want to do is inside this first element of the array we want to put the value that our user types into the console so I will simply say this first element of the array will be equal to console do readline like this now because this input here will be in string format what I need to do is I need to convert it into decimal so I will simply say decimal do parse and then whatever the user has typed into the console I will simply parse or convert that into decimal number and then I will store that decimal number as the first element of my array so let's add one more thing before we start the application so here I will say console. WR line so I will write a message for my user I will say calories for day one okay so after I write this message I will expect my user to enter the calories for the first day so let's start the app okay and it says calories for day one and if I enter for example 25 60 and I press enter this value here this 2560 will be stored as the value for the first day as the value for the first element of our array so now if we want to enter the values for these remaining six element we can copy this code adjust it and that way we can enter values for all of the elements of our array so let's do that let's copy this code so that we can enter the value for the second element so I will say calories for day two and then here I will say weekly calories of this element here so the element that has index one that is second element okay and then let's do this for the remaining five days of the week so 1 2 3 4 five so I will adjust now this output so day three day four five six and 7 and then here we are going from zero so 0 1 2 and then 3 four five and six so by doing this we will be able to enter manually the values for each element of our array and if I start the app it will ask us to enter values for all seven elements so let's say 250 0 0 and then 260 0 3,000 okay and then day seven like this so here we have initialized our entire array and we have entered the values for all seven elements now since this array was already initialized with the values that we have hardcoded ourselves what this code here does is that it will simply overwrite these values with the values that are us user enters so this line here is going to overwrite this value here and then this line here is going to overwrite this value here and so on so now the question is is this part here even necessary because as you can see it is going to be overwritten and the answer is no this part here is not necessary so we don't have to specify the values of the elements of the array when we create the array what we can do instead is we can simply Say Hey I want to create an array and it is going to be a new array of decimal numbers and here inside these squared brackets we need to put how many elements the array will have so here I will say seven so I have created my array and I have said that I want new array of decimal numbers that will have seven elements but I'm still not providing the the values for elements because I can do that part later okay so this is another way to initialize your array so you create it here and then later you initialize it with the values that your user enters okay so I will delete this part we don't need it anymore and this is the code that remains so once more this is how you can access an element of the array by using the name of the array and then the index of that specific element and by doing that you can access any element of your array now there is a problem with this code here it works it is okay but it is very redundant which means that we are repeating a lot of code unnecessarily here we have an array of seven elements and we have already written a lot of code and we have repeated a lot of code as well so imagine what would happen if the array had 100 elements or 1,000 or even 1 million elements that's not a lot in the world of programming in that case we would have to repeat these two lines of code 1 million times and in that case our code would be completely unmanageable so now you might ask Salina is there a better way to do this is there a shorter and easier way to access all of the elements of the array and the answer is yes yes there is so what we can do is we can use a loop in order to iterate through all of the elements of our array and that way we can access each individual element and do whatever we want with that element so if you're not familiar with loops I am going to link a video here and also in the description and you can watch that video in order to learn everything that you need to know about loops in programming so let's see how we can do this with the help of four loop I will say four and then I will say in I is equal to zero so I will start at the first element of my array that is the element with index zero and then I will say I is less than or equal to six because that is the index of the last element so an array that has seven elements the indexes for that array start at zero and then the last element has the index of six so from zero to six and then in each iteration I will increment that index by one so what I will do inside this for Loop is these two lines of code so I will say that I'm accessing the element with index of I so that is the element of the current iteration in the first iteration I is going to be zero so that will be the first element in the second iteration I is going to be one so that will be the second element and so on so in this line I'm going to enter the value for that element of the array and then I also want to adjust this message so I will say calories for day and then here I will simply print the value of I and in order to be able to use I like this inside these curly brackets I need to add this dollar symbol before my string so what this dollar sign and then these curly brackets allow me to do is to use this I as a regular variable inside my string and we have already talked about this in my video about all string Methods and everything that you need to know about strings so if you're not familiar with that I'm going to link a video here and also in the description and in that video you will learn everything that you need to know about working with strings so once more if you not familiar with this syntax make sure to watch that video and everything will be clear so I'm using this for Loop in order to iterate through all of the elements of my array from the element that has the index zero to the element that has the index of six and for each element I will print this message so please enter calories for day and then the index of the current element of the current day and then here I am simply reading the input that the user types into the console and then I'm converting that into decimal and storing it as the value for that current element and this code here does the same thing as all of this code here so these three lines of code do the same thing as these how many 14 lines of code so what I will do is I will comment out this code and now when I start the application we should see the same thing that we had when we started this code here so let's start the app okay so calories for Day Zero let's say 2560 and then 260 0 and then entering the values for the remaining element and then day five 2650 and day 63 0 0 0 okay so here I have entered the values for all of the elements of my array but the code is much shorter and easier to understand and also easier to maintain and we can use this code in order to iterate all of the elements of our array regardless of how many elements the array has and the only thing that we need to change is the index of the last element because the first element always has the index of zero so then if our array for example has 10 elements the last index will be nine if it has 100 elements the last index will be 99 and then in our case the array has seven elements so the last element has the index of six so in a very simple way we can iterate an array that has two elements as well as an array that has two million elements just with a simple short code that looks like this now one small thing that I would like to change here is this output that is shown to the user so here it says calories for day Zero and then calories for day 1 2 3 4 5 and six so here we are simply printing the index of the element and for us developers this makes sense so Day Zero is the first element but for the end user for someone who doesn't know about indexing and about programming what he expects to see is the first element to say calories for day one and then second element to say calories for day two and so on so what I will do is I will adjust this part here so instead of printing the index I will just increment it by one in order to show to our user what is natural to him so now if I start the application as you can see it says calories for day one and then calories for day two and so on so in the background we are still using our indexes and here we are using the index of the element to access that element but for our user we are just adjusting the output a little bit so that it is easier for him to understand and more natural to him because normal people still count from one and not from zero like us programmers do okay so now that we have learned how we can initialize our array how we can access each element of the array using the name of the array and then the index of the element and also now that we have learned how to iterate through all of the elements of our array using for Loop and to set the value to enter the value for each element of the array now let's see what we can do with this information so let's delete this code because we don't need it anymore and now what I want to do is I want to perform some calculations on the data that our user enters so for example let's calculate how many calories our user consumes on average and in order to do that we need to sum all of the individual days and then divide that by seven so let's stop the application and here I will create a variable of type decimal and I will call it for example total okay initially total is going to be zero so then what I will do is whenever the user enters value for a specific day so whenever he enters scaries for that day I will simply add that to our total so I will say total plus equals to the calories that our user has entered for that day like this so after this for Loop is executed we will have the values for each day so how many calories he has consumed for each day and then also inside this variable we will have the total number of color that he has consumed so then what I can do is I can find average by dividing this total by the number of days which is seven so let's calculate that here after our for Loop let's create a variable of type decimal I will call it average or let's say average caloric intake so that it is easier to understand so average Cal intake like this so how do we calculate the average well it's quite easy we simply divide the total by the number of days so total divided by seven and that is going to give us average caloric intake per day so let's print this average as a message I will say console. right line and here let's say your average caloric intake is and here I want to print this value so I will put it inside curly brackets and in order to be able to use it like this I need to add this dollar sign okay and then at the end I need semicolon so let's start the application okay so calories for day one let's say 25 0 and then 260 0 2750 okay and then let's say for last day we had really big cheat day your average caloric intake is 275 so now the question is what can we do with this information well if we know how many calories we are consuming on average and we also know how many calories we need then we can calculate if we are gaining weight or if we are losing weight now you can calculate how many calories you need on many sites on the internet because that really depends depends on many things like your gender your age your height how active you are so if you work out or not and so on so you can find different sites on the internet that are going to tell you how many calories you need to consume for me that is 25 or 2600 so I will use that in our program but you can adjust it and use number that is appropriate for you so that you can get information that is relevant for you as well and if you don't want to calculate this right now but you still want to know how many calories you need um well it depends if you are a girl you probably need around 2,000 calories maybe a little less or a little more depending on how tall you are and how active you are and if you are a boy if you are a man uh then you probably need around maybe 2800 or 3,000 calories again depending uh on how tall you are and how active you are and if you are a really big man who work works out a lot then you already know how many calories you need I don't have to tell you so now let's write some code that is going to tell us if we are gaining weight or losing weight based on the data that our user enters and how many calories we consume on average and also based on that information of how many calories you really need in order to maintain your weight so let's create a variable here for example it will be of type de and let's call it recommended caloric intake so this is how many calories we need to consume per day in order to maintain our weight so for me that is let's say 2500 calories so now we can use this value here and this value here in order to calculate and in order to determine if we are gaining weight or losing weight so let's make a prediction let's say that we are interested to know what will happen in a year from now so 365 days from now if we continue consuming this many calories on average and then this here is our recommended caloric intake so what I will do is I will subtract these two values I will say average caloric intake minus recommended caloric intake and that will tell me uh on a daily basis if I'm consuming more or less and how much and then I will multiply that by 365 days so let's say decimal and let's create a variable called annual caloric balance like this average minus recommended so I will put this inside parentheses and this here is going to tell me on a daily basis how many more or less calories I'm consuming but one day is not going to change anything but if I continue doing that for 365 days which means for a year then inside this variable here we will see how many more or less calories we have consumed for that entire year so now that I have that information and I know for example that on average each day I have consumed 100 more calories than I need on a daily basis that there is nothing it's not going to change anything but for an entire year if you continue doing that that is going to be 100 multiplied by 365 days so that is going to be 36,500 calories more than you should have consumed so now the question is how can we calculate how many kilograms this is so how much weight we have either gained or lost based on this annual caloric balance well it's simple you just need to know that each kilogram of weight is equivalent to approximately 7,000 calories so if you want to lose 1 kilogram you need to lose 7,000 calories and if you want to gain 1 kilogram then you need to eat 7,000 calories more so let's calculate that here let's say decimal weight change in kg okay so weight change in kilograms will be equal to annual caloric balance divided by 7,000 like this so inside this variable we will have the information about how many kilograms we have either lost or gained so let's print that information to our user I will say here this is your way weit change in one year okay and then let's print this value like this or even better this will be your weight change in one year if you continue doing what you are doing currently so let's start the program and let's see what the data says okay so calories for day one let's say 2600 and then let's say 2 45 and then third day I was okay again I consumed as much as I needed and then day six and day seven let's say that I consumed a little bit more so 270 again and now when I press enter we will see what the data says it says this will be your weight change in one year and then 3.35 so in one year if I continue do doing this I will gain 3.3 kg and the reason for that is because on average I'm consuming more calories than I need and in one year I will see the results of that work I will see the consequences so now the question is following let's say that we are creating a plan for ourselves because we want to lose some weight and we want to use our program in order to see if our plan is going to work and how well it is going to work so I will start this program again and now what I want to do is I want to enter my plan so let's say that I will lower my calories just a little bit so I will eat for example 2300 calories instead of 2500 which is how much I need so for five days of the week I will be on that diet so 2300 calories for the first 5 days of the week and then on day six and on day seven let's say that I will eat 2500 and then 2600 here okay so these two are like a little cheat day so now when I press enter I will see the result of this plan so this plan says that if I do this if I follow this plan in one year I will lose 6.7 kg which is great because here I'm not starving myself I'm just decreasing calories a little bit but slowly and surely I am going towards my goal which is to lose around 7 kilg in a year and if you want to lose even more weight if you want to make a plan that is even more let's say strict then you can use this program in order to calculate and predict what is going to happen by the way I don't recommend you uh to lose weight in an unhealthy way here I'm just teaching you how to program and how to write code I not teaching you how to lose weight by the way if you want to see some of my workouts and if you want to see how I maintain all of this muscle then you can follow me on Instagram because I publish a lot of my workouts there a lot of stories from the gym uh so that I can also motivate you uh to work out as well this is my handle on Instagram and I will also leave it in the description so feel free to add me I would be happy to see you there so as I said we can now adjust this program to give us different kind of information that we need so for example here is your recommended caloric intake let's say that you are a male who needs 3,000 calories per day okay and then you want to see what is going to happen in 3 months so here you are going to calculate average caloric intake minus recommended caloric intake multiplied by 90 days that is 3 months and let's also change the name of this variable let's say three three month call balance like this so you will simply divide this three month caloric balance by 7,000 and it is going to tell you what is going to happen in 90 days so let's start the program and let's say that you made a plan and your plan is to eat 500 calories less each day for the next 3 months so you are wondering what is going to happen so your day daily recommended daily intake is 3,000 calories so what you are going to do is you will eat 2500 each day for the next 3 months and you want to see what will happen so 2500 and then again okay and as you can see in just 3 months you will lose 6.5 kg and you can also adjust this output here so because we have changed our code so that now it works with 90 days you can also change this part here so this will be your weight change in three months but this here is the result and this here is what the data says so you have learned how to do this in code how to use programming and arrays in order to perform all of these calculations and make a perfect plan for yourself in order to either lose weight or gain weight and that part is easy programming is the easy part the hard part will be to actually follow this plan but that is not up to me I cannot teach you how to do that what I can do is I can teach you programming and if you want to learn practical programming if you want to learn programming through practical examples and gain the experience that you need in order to get your first job and start a successful career as a software developer then you can join code Beauty Academy you can join my practical programming course the link is going to be in the description I am waiting for you there and through the entire process I'm going to be your mentor and I will help you to achieve all of your goals and to do that in the shortest amount of time possible as I said there is a special discount that you can get as my YouTube viewer I will leave a coupon code in the description so definitely use this opportunity and finally learn programming with my help so let's do a quick summary of what we have learned in this video we have learned about arrays and and we have learned that an array is a collection of data so inside an array you can store one or more elements those elements need to be of the same type so that is the type of the array we have also learned how we can initialize an array in three different ways how we can initialize an array when we first create it using those curly brackets and separating elements with comma size second way is how we can access each individual element of the array and then Third Way was iterating through our array with the help of for Loop like we are doing here and then accessing each individual element and then doing whatever we want with that element here I am simply putting the value into the element and then here I'm using it in order to perform calculation that I need arrays are used very often in programming and they are super useful because they are very very fast now arrays have certain advantages and disadvantages when compared to some other data structures but I will leave that part for some other video because this video is already getting too long so if you're interested in this topic and if you want to learn more about arrays and you want to learn more about arrays versus other data structures or other data structures in general let me know in the comment section and I will create those videos and before I end this video there is one more very important thing that I want to show you and that is the most common error that happens when working with arrays especially to beginners and that would be index out of range or index out of bounds error so how can you get that error well you can get it if you are trying to access an element of the array that does not exist and that can happen in the following situation for example here if I said that I want to iterate from 0 to 7 instead of six let's see what will happen so let's start the app and here I will enter any values it doesn't matter okay and here it is asking me for calories for day8 this is already suspicious but if I enter a number here as you can see I get this exception it says index was outside the bounds of the array so this exception is called index out of range or index out of bounds and it indicates that we are trying to access the element of our array which does not exist why it does not exist well because here we are saying that our array has seven elements so that would be indexes from 0 to six and here we are clearly not doing that because here we are going from zero to seven and that is the reason why we are experiencing this error so this is very common error that happens to a lot of beginners especially when you first start learning about arrays so it is very important that you remember that indexes for an array start from zero which means that the last element will not have index of seven here it will have index of six so if size of the array is seven the last element is six and then if size is 100 the last index is 99 and so on so in order to avoid this error you need to remember this and be very very careful so now that you have learned about arrays in programming you can use this knowledge in order to create different applications for example here we have created an application that is going to help us to lose or gain weight but what I want to do is I want to to give you also a task that you can do for homework in order to practice on your own and in order to create another useful application that will help you with saving money so I want you to create the following application as homework I want you to create an array where you are going to enter how much money you are saving each day for let's say 10 days and then I want you to calculate based on that how much money you are saving on average daily so once you have that information you can calculate how much money you will have saved in what's say one year so 365 days so I want to give that task to you in order to solve on your own and practice and if you manage to solve it you can paste the code Down Below in the comments so that I can review it and so that other people can also see it and then give you some tips advice upgrade that code and so on so thank you very much for watching if you have any questions or any topics that you would like to see in the future on this channel let me know in the comment section and then if you enjoyed this video give it a big thumbs up so that I know to create more videos like this one in the future uh so once more thank you very much for watching and I will see you in some other video
