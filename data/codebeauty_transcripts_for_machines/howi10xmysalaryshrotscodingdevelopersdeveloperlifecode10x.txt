how I connect my salary as a developer so in just two years I went from 2000 to 20 000 per month and here's how the main mistake most programmers make nowadays is as soon as they get a job they want they start ignoring other job offers on LinkedIn you already have a job you are in the perfect position to make what I like to call disrespectful offers a disrespectful offer is the next time you receive a message from a software company asking if you want to work for them say yes but ask for double the money so if you currently work for 5 000 ask for 10 and if you work for 10 ask for twenty thousand and it doesn't matter if you think that it's too much because you would be surprised at how many companies are willing to pay a lot more money than you think and the only thing that you have to do is ask of course a lot of companies will reject it but you know what is your biggest Advantage you are not desperate to accept any job because you already have one so you need only one company that is going to pay as much as you ask and that is definitely going to happen in two three four months and that is how you are going to double your salary
