hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ functions if you're a beginner to C++ make sure to watch my C++ for beginners playlist and there you can really find some of the most important concepts that you need to understand as someone who learns C++ and also you can find a lot of exercises that you are going to find useful for practicing C++ and in this video I wanted to talk about functions more specifically about function parameters or arguments and before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon as well so that you are notified when I publish my next video and also follow me on my other social media profiles so through code Beauty Instagram and Twitter accounts in order to get a little bit of a sneak a peek into a developer's life so how really developer life looks like so without further ado let's start with today's lesson so as I said in this video I want to talk about C++ function parameters or arguments and the first thing that I want to explain is what are parameters so what are arguments and in my previous video we have talked about C++ functions so if you haven't watched that video made sure to do so I'm going to link it here and sometimes a function needs to receive a certain value a certain variable and then perform a certain task on that value so on that variable or it really needs the value of that variable in order to perform a certain task so let's explain how we are going to create a function that receives a parameter in C++ so here I am going to add a function of return type void and I'm going to say that that function is going to be called let's say introduce me introduce me like this and then in these parentheses here we can put parameters that our function is going to receive and after that in these curly brackets we are going to put the body of our phone so as I said in these parentheses here we are going to put parameters and they are specified in the following way so first you are going to write out the type of your parameter and that is going to be trained like this and then we are going to specify the name of our parameter and that is going to be what's a name so we want to pass in this function that is going to introduce our user we want to really pass the name of our user and then what our function is going to do we are going to put in these curly brackets here and that is going to be really to introduce our user so our function is going to write out C out let's say my name is and then let's write out this name that we have received in this function so I'm going to say name and I'm going to add and line like this okay so this is the way to pass a parameter so to pass a value to your function and as I said in my previous video you can really separate this declaration and definition of a function so you can put really declaration of your function here so before your main function and then you can put definition of your function after your main function and if you don't know how to do that make sure to watch my first video of this playlist okay so now I want to invoke this function here and how we do that well we specify the name of my function so I'm going to say introduce me and then since this this function receives argument so since this function function receives a parameter here we really have to pass that parameter to our function and then I'm going to put here so here I'm going to pass an argument to my function so I'm going to say salteena like this and this here really is called argument so it is a value that we pass to our function and then here it is called parameter okay so now if I run my program you can see that my function has successfully introduced me so it says my name is Selena like this okay so here we have really here we have really defined our function so the parameters that our function receives name return type and then the block of code that our function is going to execute and then here we have invoked our function and passed an argument which is this string of text here to our function which is going to be received in this name variable and then our function is going to really treat it as a variable which means that it is going to write that value here okay and now if I try to invoke this function once more so I'm going to copy this this line and then paste it here and let's say that I'm going to pass it a different value so I'm going to say for example Anna okay you can see that now our function has successfully introduced two users so it has said my name is my name is Saudi you know and then my name is Anna and there is also another thing that I want to explain and that is going to be how you can pass multiple arguments to your function and there is going to be in a following way so here in these parentheses where I have specified my first parameter you can put comma sign and then you specify your second third fourth fifth and your other parameters so you specify the type which is also going to be string in this particular case and let's say that my second parameter is going to be called city like this and let's add another one so let's say int age like this so now in this function I am going to write out also where is my user from and also how old my user is so I'm going to write out C out I am from and then let's write out this city that we have passed in this function and add also and why and let's write out also I am I am H so I am however many years we have passed in this function and then let's say years old Oh like this okay so now we have really introduced our user in more detail and we have passed this function name city and age information for our user but as you can see here our function so our compiler really says that this function is not valid it has too few arguments in a function call meaning that this invocation this call of a function does not really contain all the necessary parameters were all the necessary arguments that we need to pass to our function which means that it really lacks the city and age parameters so here I'm going to put comma as well and then I'm going to specify my city this here is bolded so it is bold and that means that we have to really pass a city value to our function so I'm going to write out my start like this and then I am also going to specify age so I'm going to say 25 and let's do the same for our and I user so I'm going to say that our Anna is from New York and let's say that she has 27 years old for example so now when I run my program you can see that we have successfully introduced to users so my name is Sal Dina I am from Moscow I am 25 years old and then also my name is Anna I'm from New York and I am 27 years old ok so and we have really written this code only once and then we can reuse it however many times we need to so in this particular case we have used it too okay and another thing that I want to explain is going to be a default parameter so what is default parameter sometimes you really don't want to pass a value to your function meaning that in a specific situation you don't have that value or you don't want to pass it and in that case you want to define define default value for your parameter so in the case where you use where your user does not pass that argument to your function for example you can say that your age parameter here has the default value of zero okay and that means that you don't really have to pass this age parameter anymore so here I'm going to delete this age for my ana user and let's run our program now in order to see how this function is going to behave for this first user and then also to see how it is going to behave for this second user user which did not specify this age parameter so this age argument and when I run it you can see that my first user has been introduced as it was previously so I am 25 years old and then the second user which did not specify age argument it really said I am zero years old meaning that our function has really taken this default value and it has written out I am and then this default value and then years old we are missing s here okay so I'm going to add s and I want to do a full winged thing so in the case where our user does not pass this value for our age parameter I'm going to really check whether we have that value or we have this default value and then in the case where we have only this default value I don't want to write this line of code here so I am going to say here if age is not equal to zero meaning that our user has specified some other value which is not zero then and only then we are going to write this line of code but in the case where we have only this default value we do not really want to write out that our user has zero years old because that does not make sense okay so as you can see now my first user has been introduced as I am 25 years old and then my name is Ella I'm from New York since Ana did not specify how old she is we haven't written out her age here because of this check that we have added okay so that was about default parameter and there is one thing also that I want to that I want to say about this default parameter and that is going to be really if I delete this is equal to zero and that I try to assign default value to this city parameter so I say let's say the city is equal to default like this you can see that the compiler is really underlying this function and it says okay it says the fourth argument not at end of parameter list meaning that you can specify default argument only at the end of this list so if you want to specify the fault value for this parameter you will have to specify the full value for this one as well so if I add the full value here so I have added zero then we can really add a default value for this second parameter and then we can add the full value for this one as well and now we are really left with so our compiler is not underlying this introduce me function name anymore okay and this does not make sense so I'm going to delete it but I wanted to explain that you cannot specify the full value for your middle parameter if you did not specify a default value at the end of your parameter list and there is one more thing that I want to show you and there is going to be that you don't have to hard code these values as we did here so I am going to comment the is out and then I'm going to let my user define his own values for these three variables so I am going to declare two variables of type string which are going to be named and City and then also I'm going to declare a variable of type int which is going to be called age and then I'm going to say C out so please enter a name like this it's not capital letter okay and then C in name and then C out City so after my user has entered name I want him to enter city so C in city like this and then also I want to enter age and C in age like this so now after my user has specified these three variables so name city and age I can pass these tree in my introduce me function so I can say introduce me and then pass name and city and age like this and if I run my program now as you can see my program really asks me to enter a name so let's say the name is going to be Tom for example and then let's say that city is going to be London and age let's say 32 okay and now as you can see my function has successfully introduced Tom so it says my name is Tom I am from London and I am 32 years old okay and you don't really have to use these names for the variables in your main function so the names of these variables here do not have to be the same as these names here here so you can call these for example name one city one age one but you are going to have to use these names in your main function so you will have to say name one city one age 1 and here as well but these names do not have to be the same as these names here your program is going to work correctly you have to however have the same type here and here so this here has to be string if it has been declared a string here and this one as well and then age also has to be of type int if it has been declared as int here and once more if I run my program you can see that it asks for name so Tom New York and then age is going to be 22 and as you can see my name is Tom I'm from New York I am 22 years old so your program works just fine so I hope that you have understood how parameters behave in a function and how you can pass multiple parameters to your function and also how you can specify a default parameter in your function and if you enjoyed this video if you learned something new make sure to subscribe to my channel click the bell icon so that you are notified when I publish my next video
