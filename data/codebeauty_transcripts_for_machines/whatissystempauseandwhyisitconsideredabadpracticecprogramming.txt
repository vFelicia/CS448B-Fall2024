hi everyone and welcome to my channel in this video i want to explain what is system pause command and why it is considered a bad practice and why some people say that you should never use it and i'm going to demonstrate everything that i talk about using this simple c program that i have written in my visual studio so if you look at this program here you will notice that there is no system pause command here and then you will notice also that this is the most simple hello world program that just writes out this message to our console so let's see what is going to happen if i run this program okay did you notice what just happened our program started and then it closed very very quickly and we were not able to see the output in our console so we were not able to see if this message here indeed had been outputted to our console so now your question might be is that an error is the fact that when i run my program and it closes so quickly is that a bug a mistake the answer is no because when your program starts it is going to need cpu in order to be executed and then it is going to take memory as well so it is going to take certain computer resources so it's only logical that once your program finishes and executes all of the lines that it has that program should end and return those resources back to your computer so that they can be reused by other programs so that is exactly what happens when i run this program okay so your program starts here at this first line of our main function and then it writes out this message here and then it ends here okay so this open curly bracket is the first line of your program and then this closed curly bracket of your main function is the last line of your program and again that is exactly what happens when i start this program so it opens here and then it writes out this message and then it closes at this line of code here so now your question might be okay salina but that happens so quickly and i am not able to read the output in my console so how can i do that how can i pause my program so that i am able to review the output in my console and the answer is that that is exactly the reason why some people use system pause command so if i say system pause like this okay and if i run my program now as you can see the execution of my program has been paused and here i'm able to read the output in my console so here is hello world text and then it also has this message here which says press any key to continue now what this message here means it means that now your program is waiting for you to press a key and only after you press a key your program is going to continue and this line of code here this eighth line which says system pause is the line where the execution of your program has been paused and from here it will continue after you press a key so the only thing left to do after this line of code here is this closed curly bracket of your main function which represents the end of your program so that means that after i press a key here my program is going to end which will result in closing the console so let's demonstrate that okay as you can see our program now has closed now another thing that i want to show you is this text here this text which says press any key to continue if you are bothered by this text and if you don't want to see it what you can do is you can say here pause greater than now or pause greater than zero okay and if i run my program again as you can see it says hello world and that press any any key to continue text is not shown anymore but the program still behaves the same which means that it is still waiting for you to press a key in order to continue the execution of the program okay so let's close this now so here i have introduced you with system pause command and you have seen how the program behaves with and without it now i want to give you some more details and i want to explain some potential issues and problems that can happen if you use system pause command so what is system pause system is a function that is going to invoke your operating system and it is going to say hey operating system can you please run this pause program now what a pause program does is that it pauses the execution of its parent program which is this program here and it waits for you to press a key and only after you press a key this pause program will end and only then the execution will return to your parent program and your parent program will continue its execution now the problem with this system pause is that it is not portable which means that it is a platform specific hack that is going to work only for windows operating system so if you tried to run this command here or on linux or on mac operating systems it is not going to work and then i also believe that it is not going to work for most online compilers so um it is again as i said it is a platform specific hack for windows operating system um now your question might be okay selena but how can i pause the execution of my program so that i am able to read the output in my console so that my program does not close very fast and here i want to give you three different ways to do that and then if you are familiar with some other ways feel free to share them in the comments section so the first way instead of using this system pause command which is as we already said a platform dependent hack that works only on windows is to use a functionality that is defined in c plus language itself and that is c in dot get function okay now what this c in dot get function does is that it waits for you to press enter and then it continues the execution of your program so if i run my program as you can see the execution has been paused and it waits for me to press enter so if i do that the execution is going to continue and my console will close so that is what this c in dot get achieved now this as i already said is not platform dependent but it is a functionality that is defined in c plus plus language itself which means that it is not going to work only on windows but it will work on other operating systems as well now a problem with this is that this is not the main purpose of c in dot get but it's just a way for you to achieve that behavior that i just demonstrated so to pause the execution of your program and then if you want me to make a video a separate video where i explain this c in dot get functionality and it's used you can let me know in the comments down below and i will make a separate video about c in dot get in c plus so that is the first way for you to pause the execution of your program the second approach that i have seen people use is a break point so let's demonstrate what that means if i delete this c in dot get we expect our program to behave the same way that it did at the beginning which means to start and then to close very quickly so how am i going to pause the execution of my program the answer is by using a breakpoint so on this vertical line here in my visual studio i will press the line where i want to add a breakpoint to and that is going to be this line here so just before my program closes i want to pause it so if i run my program now as you can see the execution of my program has been paused so we are able to read the console and then here is where it has been paused and this button here if you noticed it says continue so only after i press this button here the execution of my program will continue and my program will continue from this line of code here which means that it will end and it will close the console so let's do that if i press continue as you could see the console has been closed now breakpoints are used in order to debug your program which means to follow the execution of your program to investigate what is happening during that execution and to fix and discover some potential bugs and also you can add more than one breakpoint to your program if you want and if you need so i can add another breakpoint here for example and and then also another very important thing is that these break points that you see here the execution of your program will stop at this break point and then at this break point here only if you run it by using this option so only if you say start debugging or if you press f5 key if you decide to run your program by using this start without debugging or if you press ctrl f5 then your program is not going to stop at any break point so that was the second way for you to pause the execution of your program and that was by using break points so let's remove these two and now i want to show you the third way for you to pause the execution of your program without using system pause command the third option is already built in inside visual studio and it is this option here so debug and then start without debugging or you can also press control plus f5 keys and if you decide to run your program by using this start without debugging option as i already said your program is not going to pause at any break points but your program as well will pause at the end just before closing the console so you will be able to read the output in your console so if i press start without debugging as you can see our program paused and we can read the output in our console and then it also says press any key to continue so if i press a key my program will continue and the console will close so those were some suggestions that you can use in order to pause the execution of your program and read the output in your console and then also if you have some other suggestions you can put them in the comments section so i hope that you enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and then also if you have any questions or if you have any ideas and suggestions for my future videos you can leave those in the comment section and if you want to learn more about programming and if you want to see more videos like this
