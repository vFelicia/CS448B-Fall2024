hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video you are going to learn how to work with strings I'm going to teach you everything that you need to know from the beginning and I will also show you some of the most common errors that beginners make when working with strings so let's go straight to the point and the first thing that I want to explain is what is string string in C and in many other programming languages is a data type that is used in order to store a sequence of characters so basically it's is used to store text now the best way for you to understand this is to see it on an example so let me show you an example let's create a string variable so you say string and then you give the name to your variable so let's say for example letter like this and then inside these quotation marks you are going to put the value for this string here so for example here I will assign just one character so let's say letter A so this string variable could take contains just one character now you can also assign more than one character so let's create another string variable let's say for example word and here I will assign more than one character so let's say for example this word here programming okay so this string variable contains more than one character and then you can also assign an entire sentence so let's create another string variable I will call it sentence like this and then let's copy for example this sentence here so learn practical programming and start your career and then this here is my website in case that you want to learn practical programming so all of these three are examples of string variables and as I already said string is used in order to store a sequence of characters that can be one character or it can be an entire sentence or even a longer text so now your question is probably how many characters can I put inside a single string variable well what do you think let me know in the comment section so the answer is you can put a lot of characters technically that depends on how much memory your computer has uh so in most modern computers there is probably billions of characters and just to get an idea of how much that really is the entire Harry Potter series so all of the books contain between six and 7 million characters depending on the translation and the language so you can put really a lot of characters inside a single string variable but you should avoid to work with really big strings because that can slow down your computer and it can cause some performance issues so a better question is why would you want to store so many characters inside a single string variable so now that we have created these string variables let's for example print them to the console so I will say console. right line and then here I will put the variable that I want to print to the console so if I say for example letter and I start the program we should get in the console only this letter A okay and then if I print for example this word variable we should get the word programming okay and then if I print this entire sentence and I start the program we get this entire sentence printed in the console now as I said string variables are used in order to store a sequence of characters but characters are not just letters inside a string variable we can also store some special characters for example this character here or this character here those are not letters those are special characters so so I can also create for example a string called special characters like this and inside this string we can store something like hashtag dollar sign percentage and and so on so inside a string variable we can also put special characters but not all special characters later in this video I'm going to show you some special characters that you cannot store for inside strings or at least not as easily as these that I have here so those are some exceptional situations and some errors and mistakes that a lot of developers make and I will explain that later in the video so make sure to watch the entire video in order to learn everything that you need to know about strings so now if I print this string to the console we should get these special characters like you can see here now also inside a string you can store numbers so here I can create a variable let's call it age and inside it I will put for example 29 because that is my age and if I print this variable here we should get 29 in the console so inside a string variable you can store a single letter you can store a word you can store an entire sentence so you can store letters or you can store special characters like I have here or you can even store numbers there are some important things that you should know if you are doing this so if you are storing numbers inside a string but I'm going to explain that in a few minutes and first I want to show you another interesting thing that you can do and that is you put your string and then you say dot length and that is going to give you the length of the string so how many characters that string contains so if I say age. length and I start the program as you can see we get two because this string here contains only two characters number two and number nine and then if I say for example this word so word. length and I start the program we get 11 because that is how many characters this word here has so let's check that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 indeed and then if I say for example sentence. length Okay we get 76 and I'm not going to check this one manually so basically what this link does is it gives you the number of characters that this string here contains and something else that we can have is an empty string so I can say string let's name it empty string like this and then I simply put these quot a marks but inside I'm not going to put anything so this here is an empty string and if I say empty string. link and I start the program we should get zero and as you can see this string contains zero characters now let's talk about string concatenation so what is string concatenation it is just a fancy word that programmers use that means to combine two strings together so let's delete this this code that I have here and I'm going to show you how that works on an example so let's create a string variable let's call it name and here I will put for example John like this and then I will say console do right line and here I will say hello and then I will add plus symbol and I will add this name variable so now if I run the program what do you expect to get let me know in the comment section let's start the program let's see and we get hello John so these two strings have been concatenated which means they have been combined together so we see this output in our console okay so this part here is called string literal which means that it is a string that is not stored inside any variable it is hardcoded here and whatever we put here inside these quotation marks that is what we are going to get in the console and then this here is a string variable which means that whatever name we put inside these quotation marks for example Salina we will get that name printed in our console so now if I run the program as you can see now we get hello Salina okay so that also means that we can let our user to enter his name so I will delete the value for my string variable and I will say something like this console do readline so please read whatever the user writes in the console and store that inside this name variable so now if I run the program let's see what we are going to get so we have this prompt where we can enter text for example I will say code Beauty okay and if I press enter it is going to to respond with hello code Beauty okay so once more this is a string literal which means that this hardcoded text will be printed and then here we are adding more text that we want to print to the console and that is going to be whatever value is stored inside this variable here so whatever our user enters that will be concatenated to this hello word and that will be printed in the console okay now something interesting and important that I promise to explain is what happens if you have numbers inside string so let me show you an example I will delete this we don't need it and this part as well and here I will say inside a string two and then plus and here let's also add two like this okay so this is one example and then another example is 2 + 2 but without these double quotation marks so now my question for you is please pause the video and write me in the comment section what do you expect to be result of this line here and then what do you expect to be the result of this line here and also explain if these two are going to be different why do you think that they are going to be different or if they are going to be the same why do you think that they are going to be the same please pause the video and write that in the comment section so let's start the program let's see okay and as you can see this first line gives us the result of 22 and then this second line gives us the result of four so now the question is why do we get 22 here and then four here well the difference is how this plus operator behaves when it stands between two strings and when it stands between two integers or two floats doubles or any other numerical type so in this case here we have an integer and another integer and in that case plus is going to sum those two so we get four and then in this case here we have two strings so what plus operator is doing is it is simply concatenating those two strings so that is the reason why we see 22 here so if I say for example 3 + 2 4 and then here I also say 2 3 + 2 4 and I start the program as you can see here we get the sum and then here we just get concatenation so here these two strings are just combined together so that is the difference how this plus operator behaves when it is working with two strings versus when it is working with two integers so with two numerical types and this is one very important difference and one thing that is confusing for a lot of beginners and it is very important that you understand this Behavior so that you don't make a mistake as well now let me show you another way to concatenate strings so one way is with the help of this plus operator and another way is with the help of concat function so let's delete this code here and let's create two string variables let's say string first name and here I will say Sala that is my name okay and then let's also create create another string variable let's call it last name like this and here I will say Noak that is my last name so another way to concatenate these two strings as I said is with the help of concat function so let's say console. WR line and here I want to print these two strings together so once more the first way was with the help of plus operator so first name Plus last name like this and then another way is with the help of string do concat okay and then here you put all of the strings that you want to concatenate so all of the strings that you want to combine together so in our case those are first name and then I will add comma and then last name so if I print this line as you you can see we get Salina norak and if you want to add space between these two you can add here another string which is just going to be an empty space and if I start the program now as you can see these three strings have been concatenated so they have been combined together and the result of that is this output here so far I have demonstrated two ways to combine strings together the first way was with with the help of plus operator and then the second way was with the help of this concat function and both of these are okay they are perfectly fine to use but what most developers do is they use a third way which is called string interpolation and now I'm going to show you what is string interpolation so let's delete this we don't need it anymore and now let me show you what is string interpolation string interpolation is achieve D with the help of this dollar symbol so you say dollar symbol and then you open these quotation marks and here you are going to put your text your characters so let's say my name is and then something interesting is that you can use these curly brackets and inside them you can put your variables so my name is and then I'm using variable and this string interpolation is very e easy and common way to combine string literals which I have here and also variables but just remember it is very important that you put this dollar symbol and also that you put your variables inside these curly brackets so if I run this program as you can see we get my name is Salina but once more as I said it is very important that you put your variables inside curly brackets otherwise if I omit these curly brackets this entire string is just going to be string literal so we are going to get literally this text that we have here so my first name is first name okay so that is the first part don't forget these curly brackets and then also please don't forget this dollar symbol so if I forget dollar symbol again we get this string literal so we get literally whatever we have written inside this string so once more don't forget this string interpolation symbol which is dollar sign and also very important is that this dollar sign must stand in front of your string so before you open quotation marks for your string you put this dollar sign and everything is going to work without problems so now we can combine here text however we want so my name is and then first name and then I will add space and I will use this last name variable like this and I can also say and I am uh let's say 29 years old and if I start the program as you can see we get my name is and then the value of first name the value of last name and then and I am 29 years old now something else that is interesting is that inside these curly brackets you can write even Expressions so here you can say for example I am let's say 10 + 19 and if I start the program again we get 209 because your compiler your computer is going to calculate this expression here and then when it gets to result it is going to print that result so here is an interesting example for you to exercise your brain so if you say for example string interpolation and then inside this string you say 2 + 2 is is equal to and then here you say 2 + 2 but inside these curly brackets what do you expect to get please pause the video write me the answer in the comment section and then you can start the program and see the result okay so if I start the program we get 2 + 2 is equal 2 and then we get four and the reason for that is once more this part here is a string literal which means that it will be written literally like we have it here and then this part inside these curly brackets is an expression which means that it will be calculated first and the result of the expression will be written in the console so that is the reason why we get 2 + 2 is equal 2 and then the result of the calculation so if that was your answer then you understand this well congratulations now let me show you something else let's say that we want to have some long text so let's delete this and let's create a string variable called my text and inside it I will put some longer text let's say for example hello my name is Salina I teach programming at code Beauty Academy okay so if I print this text here this is the value that we are going to get so now my idea is I want to have this sentence in one line and then I want to have this sentence in the next line and then this sentence in third line so how can we achieve that well let's see so if I do something like this let's see what we are going to get so we have hello and then I will put this inside another string literal and I will put plus between these two and I will put this second string literal inside another line and then let's close this quotation mark here and let's create another string literal and again I will put plus sign here and I will put this third sentence inside third line so now if I start the program let me know what do you expect do you expect these three sentences to be in three different lines or not and why so let me know in the comment section and then you can watch my solution and explanation so let's start the program and the result is quite disappointing we did not achieve what we wanted because this text is still together and the reason for that is because that is how this plus operator works that is how concatenation works and it does not care if you have one new line between these two or if you have two or three or however many you want to put there still if I start the program this text is going to be together so in order to solve this problem we need to find a new approach a better approach and and that is with the help of Escape characters so now your question is what are Escape characters and those are like special commands that we can use in different situations for example one command that we have is this command here so back slash n and that means please add new line here so if I start the program as you can see we have hello and then new line and then we have this remaining text so if I add this new line here as well so back sln and I start the program again as you can see now these three sentences have been separated into different lines so hello and then new line and then my name is Salina and then new line and then I teach programming at code Beauty academy.com okay so once more Escape characters are like special commands and an example is this Escape character here so back sln and that is going to add a new line after this text here and that also means that now I can even omit these plus symbols because they don't really do anything so even if I write something like this so I say hello and then back slash n and then I have this text here and then again back sln and I delete this plus symbol and I also write all of this together like this and if I start the program we are still going to get the same result so hello and then new line my name is Salina again new line I teach programming at www.code Beauty academy.com and if you're wondering what kind of programming you can learn in my Academy you can learn practical programming you can work on real projects and Gain real experience and throughout that entire process you are going to get my help and my mentorship so that you can start your career as soon as possible and start earning money as soon as possible I'm going to leave more details in the description I will also leave a link that you can use in order to get a special discount that we currently have in case that you decide to join code Beauty Academy now while we are at the topic of Escape characters let me show you another Escape character so we already said that this one back sln is used in order to add a new line but let's use another one let's say la la and then I will say back SLT and again la la so if I start the program as you can see this Escape character is just going to add one tab difference between these two strings so that is what this Escape character here means so back SLT is just going to add one tab space between this word here and this word here and you probably probably already figured out that this back slash symbol has some sort of a special power so what happens if I do something like this if I say this is text with and then I add back slash so if I start the program what do you expect to get let me know in the comment section so let's start the program and as you can see immediately we get an error and the reason for that is because indeed this backlash symbol has a special power and it is not possible to use it like this so if you want to write backslash to your console you will need to add another backslash so now if I run the program as you can see it says this is text with backslash and here we get just one backslash because remember this backslash is a special character that is used in order to use Escape commands like adding new line or adding tab space between text so if you want to print backs slash itself you will need to put it twice so back slash and then backs slash again so now you know how to write text in multiple lines and how to add new lines between your sentences so we use Escape characters for that back sln in order to add a new line so that is one way and it is perfectly okay to use Escape characters but now I'm going to show you something that um experience developers prefer to use and a better way to write multiline text and that is called verbatim sign so what is verbatim sign so verbatim is represented with this at character so you put at in front of your string and now what you can do is you can write multiline text so you can say for example ex my name is Salina and then I will add a new line and here let's say I've been coding since 2013 and let's add another line let's say I love teaching other people to code and let's say also I have two cats very relevant so now if I start this program because we have used this verbatim sign our text should be in this exact format here so if I start the program as you can see we have the first sentence here and then the second sentence is in the new line third also in the new line and then fourth sentence also in the new line and that is what this verbatim sign allows us to do so you don't have to use any Escape characters and if you want to write multiline text you simply put an enter and and another enter and let's say another enter here and when you start the program your text is going to be formatted without any Escape characters okay and what is even cooler is that you can combine this verbatim sign with string interpolation remember what string interpolation was it was that dollar character which we can use in order to write expressions or use variables inside our strings so here I can say now I have two cats and if I get one more I will have and here inside these curly brackets I can say 2 + 1 so if I start the program as you can see here it says I will have three so now I have a question for you and that is why do we get three here no actually I'm kidding that's not the question I already explained that when we were talking about string interpolation the question for you is should I get another cat nobody's going to know they're going to know how would they know so I believe that is enough for this video you learned a lot about working with strings but there is a lot more that you should also know I will leave that for the next video where you are going
