hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners in this video I wanted to explain the concept of ternary operator also known as conditional operator and also some people call it shorter version of FL statement it is an important concept that you are definitely going to come across in your programming career and you should understand it and I'm going to explain this concept through building fun and simple program that is going to be a guessing game so let's explain the rules of this game we need to have two users and our first user which I'm going to call host user has to enter a number after that we have to delete that number from our console so that our second user cannot see it and then after that our second user which I'm going to call guest user has to enter his guests so that he can guess what number our first user has entered so this way we can really make a fun program and learn an important concept at the same time and at the end of this video I'm going to give you an idea or multiple ideas how you can really upgrade this program on your own so make sure to watch the entire video now that we have explained the rules of this game let's start building our program and the first thing that we need to do is create two variables since we said that our user is going to be guessing numbers those two variables are going to be definitely a number type and let's say that that type is going to be integer so integer numbers and we need two variables the first one is going told our first user number so our host user number and that our second variable is going to hold the number that our guest user enters so let's call those two cost user number like this and then the second one let's call guest user number like this okay and now after we have created these two variables the next thing that we need to do is let's write out a message to our host user so that he knows that he should a number so let's see see out and let's just say first like this so that our Haas user really knows that he should enter a number and I'm going to accept that number in my console using the C in command and I'm going to start at number inside our host user number variable so with this line here we have entered our host user number and what we have said at the beginning of this video is that after our host user enters the number we really need to delete that number from our console so that our second user is not able to see it and the command that I'm going to use for that is going to be this command here so I'm going to say system and then I'm going to say CLS which is which is really going to clear our console so clear our screen and now if I run my program let's see how far we have made made this program here we have this line this seventh line which says host user and it expects our host user to enter a number so I'm going to say for example 7 and then after I press ENTER this number here really is deleted so our console has been cleared and now after this we need to ask our guest user to guess the number that our host user has entered so I'm going to stop the program and next we need to write out a message to our guest user so I'm going to say guests like this and after that we need to accept what our guest user enters inside our guest user variable so I'm going to copy this line here like this and instead of accepting that value inside host user number I'm just going to change this to guest user number and after this part here we really have both accepted our host user number and our guest user number and now we need to compare these two and see whether our guest user has guessed correctly our host user's number so how we can do that if you are familiar with ifelse statements and I'm going to link that video here and if you are familiar with them that is really one way to solve this problem so you can solve this problem with FL statement and I'm going to do that and then we are going to really convert that if our statement inside into a ternary operator so how we can solve this with ifelse statements well it is quite simple solution so we have to say if and then inside these parentheses I'm going to really compare these two numbers so host user number and guest user number so I'm going to say cost user number is equal to guest user number like this and then if this here results is true so if these two is if these two numbers are the same we can write out a message to our user and that message is going to be let's say correct like this so our user has guessed correctly but in a situation where this here results as false we can use our else statement and in this else situation let's write out a different message to our user so let's say C out and then inside is these quotation marks let's say failed like this so that in the case where these two are the same number we can write out our user that he has guessed correctly and then in a situation where these two are not the same we can write out to our user that he has failed in guessing so if I run my program now you see that it expects our host user to enter a number and I'm going in this situation to take the role of both host and guest user so I'm going to enter 7 for example and then you see that that 7 number has been deleted from our console because of this command here and now our program expects our guest user to enter his number and I even forgot what number I entered so let's say that our Hoss user has entered for example 11 and you see that our program says you have failed so you haven't guessed correctly and one more time let's enter for our host user number 5 for example and then let's say that our guest user also says number 5 and our program says you have guessed correctly so this is one potential solution for this problem but I wanted to show you how you can solve this problem using ternary operator and now I'm going to comment this code here like this so this is a comment for multiple lines of code and let's really translate this part of code here into a ternary operator like this okay so how does the ternary operator work well it is the only operator that takes three operands or works on tree or prawns and the first operand is going to be a condition so I'm going to copy this condition here which is is our host user number equal to our guest user number so that is going to be the first operand and after that first operand we need to put this question mark and then after this question mark we have the following behavior if this expression here so if this condition here is true we are going to execute one line of code or actually one part of code and that is going to be this line here but in the situation where this here results as false we are going to execute whatever we put after this column sign so that is going to be our C out failed like this and this is really the syntax for our ternary operator and as you can see it really is a shorter form of ifelse statement so this line of code really means please check this condition here and if this condition here results as true execute this part of code here but if this code here results as false please execute whatever I put after my column sign so that is going to be our C out failed and now if I run the program it asks again for our host user to enter the number let's enter number nine for example and then our guest user has to guess the number so let's enter for example number three and you can see our program says to our guest user that he has failed in guessing so there are a couple of ways in which you can really upgrade this program and I'm going to give you a few ideas and the first one is for example you don't have to use int type here so you can use different data type data type you can guess characters or you can guess even strings if you know how to and if some of you want to play with that and try that on their own and you get it right make sure to paste that code and it comments down below and I'm going to check it and if you get it right I'm going to pin that comment episode that everyone else can see it so that would be one way of upgrading this program another way to upgrade this program is to make it easier to your guest user and how do I mean easier well you can really limit your host user to enter a number that is going to be in a certain interval for example you can see to your host user that he can enter only a number that is going to be between let's say 1 and 15 or 50 it depends on how difficult you want to make it to your guest user and that would be one way also of upgrading this program and another and the best way of upgrading this program is going to be when we learn loops and when we do that I'm going to link the video here and how you can upgrade this program using loops well you can give your guest user multiple attempts so you can say for example let my guest user guess three times or five times before I say game over you have failed okay so I hope that you have liked this video and if you did make sure to subscribe to my channel share it with your friends and with other people that would like to learn programming and I'm going to see you in my next video bye
