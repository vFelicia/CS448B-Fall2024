hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video C++ for beginners and this video is going to be sort of a continuation to my previous video in which I showed you how you can draw rectangle shape using C++ and in this video I want to show you how you can draw triangle and reverse triangle shapes using C++ as well so if you are not familiar with how you can draw rectangle I would suggest you to watch that video first I'm going to link it here because in my opinion it is a bit more difficult to draw triangle than it is to draw our rectangle shapes so one more thing I have also created Instagram and Twitter account so if you are interested in how developer life looks like and also if you're interested in behindthescenes of these videos that I post in youtube make sure to follow me on my other social media so at true code beauty Instagram and Twitter accounts I'm going to put the link to those in the description of this video so without further ado let's start drawing our triangle shape so here I have the shape that we are going to draw in this video and there is going to be this equilateral triangle shape that I have here and there is a couple of things that I want to explain before we start to write code the first thing is going to be that this height our user really has to enter this height so we are going to let our user decide how many of these symbols are going to be on this side and this side and this side as well and the second thing is going to be that our user defines this symbol so whichever symbol our user wants to use in order to draw this shape we are going to use that symbol that he enters those are two things that we need from our user and then it is up to us to really think and figure out the algorithm that we are going to use in order to draw this triangle shape here so let me explain to you how we are going to do that so we are going to have two for loops and those are going to be nested for loop so if you're not familiar with for loop nesting I'm going to link my video on here so make sure to watch it so our outer for loop is the one that is going to control this height of a triangle so in this particular case it is going to have five iterations one two three four five and our inner for loop is the one that is going to control the width of this triangle and if you really look at this triangle you can notice that our outer for loop really goes from 1 up to the number that our user has entered so it has 5 iterations in this particular case because our user has entered 5 for the length of this triangle so for the length of its sides so that is the behavior of our outer for loop it goes from 1 up to 5 in this particular case and then the behavior of our inner for loop is going to be the following so in the first iteration of our outer for loop our inner for loop has only one iteration after that in the second iteration of outer for loop inner for loop has two iterations then in the third iteration of outer for loop inner for loop has 3 in a fourth iteration of outer for loop inner for loop has 4 and so on so that means that our inner for loop goes from 1 up to the current value of the counter of outer for loop so let's translate that into our C++ code let me return this picture here okay so before we start to write that algorithm I am going to create a variable which is going to hold the length that our user enters so I'm going to call that variable length okay and then let's write out a message to the user so that he knows that he should enter length like this and let's store the value in our length variable so that is the first thing that we need from our user and then the second thing is going to be a symbol so there is going to be of type char like this so I'm going right out Oh see out symbol like this so that our user knows that you should enter symbol as well and let's store that symbol and our symbol variable so after we have acquired these two things from our user let's translate the algorithm that I just explained into C++ code so as I said we are going to have two for loops outer for loop which is going to have countered that I'm going to call let's say I and that outer for loop it's counter goes from 1 up to the value that our user has entered and it increases by 1 in each iteration okay so I'm going to say I is equal to 1 and then I is I is less than or equal to length so going that our user has entered and then please increment that I in each iteration so that is going to be outer for loop and then inner for loop is going to go from 1 up to the current value of outer for loops counter so in the first iteration is going to execute only once so this main to have only one iteration in the second iteration of outer for loop it is going to execute twice in the third it is going to execute three times four times five times so how we are going to write that we are going to say for int and then our inner for loops counter I'm going to called J and J goes from 1 up to the value of I so up to the value of outer for loops counter and it increases by 1 as well in each iteration and in each iteration it has to write out this symbol that our user has entered so let's say C out simple like this okay and then there is one more thing that I want to explain and that is going to be after each iteration of outer for loop really the next iteration starts in a new line so we are going to write that here here I'm sorry so at the end of our for loop our outer for loop we are going to say C out and line okay and now if I run this program it asks for length I'm going to say that length is let's say Phi and then symbol is going to be start symbol and as you can see it has really written out a triangle that has the length five of these symbols that our user has entered and there is one more thing that I want to do in order to format this shape here to be a bit prettier and that is going to be really to add a function here which is going to assign to each of these symbols that our user enters so that our for loop writes out width of two fields and that is going to be done using a function that is called set W meaning set width and this function here is going to give the space of two fields to the symbol that comes after it and in order to use this function here we have to include its library and that is going to be IO manop library so I'm going to say include like this io medic oh okay and now this underlined has went away so if I run my program once more and I enter let's say for length six and then for a symbol I enter this this symbol here as you can see our triangle shape looks better now so it has the height or actually the length of six of these symbols that our user has entered and it has also used this symbol here in order to draw this triangle shape and there is one more thing that I want to show you so at the beginning this video I promised that I'm going to teach you how you can draw triangle shape and then reversed triangle shape as well so there is one very beautiful thing about programming and that is going to be code reusability and about real code reusability you are going to learn when we learn about classes and functions and when I make my videos on functions I'm going to link that video here so make sure to watch it because functions really are one of the most important things that you have to understand not only for C++ programming but for programming in general so make sure to watch that video and let's say that for now we are only going to really adjust this code here so we are going to modify it a little bit in order to draw this shape here so if you look at these two shapes you can really notice similarities and what are those so this inner for loop behaves about the same in both of these triangles but there is one key difference and that is going to be that in this triangle shape our outer for loop counts from 1 to 5 and then in this reference triangle our outer for loop really counts from 5 to 1 so if we modify that we are going to have this reverse triangle so let me move these and then I'm going to really copy this here so I'm going to use ctrl C and then ctrl we and now let's really add a couple of end lines between these two okay like this and then let's really modify this triangle shape that we have just explained and draw and as you could see on this image here our outer for loop counts from 5 to 1 which means from the side that our user has entered from 1 so that means that if we change our outer for loop we should get that reverse triangle shape so it goes from the length like this and it really goes while our eye is greater than or equal to one and that our eye decreases in each iteration so it decrements and now if I run my program it asks me for length let's say that length is going to be 5 and then symbol is going to be lets say this plus symbol and when I pressed enter we have gotten both of these triangle shapes so this one that we have drawn first and then this reverse triangle shape as well I hope that now you have really seen the real beauty of programming you learn some basics and then you can use those basics in the most creative ways that you can think of so I hope that you like this video if you did make sure to subscribe to my channel click the bell icon as well so that you are notified when I publish my next video
