hi everyone what hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome tragic hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners in this video I want to show you how you can draw shapes using C++ so before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and also hit that Bell icon as well so that you are notified when I publish my next video and let me show you now what we are going to do in this video so here where is it here I have image of the task that we are going to do today and that is going to be really to draw this rectangle shape with the desired height and width and a symbol that our user enters okay so that is the task that we are going to do in this video and let's very quickly analyze this problem and see how we are going to solve it so the first thing that we need is for our user to enter height width and that symbol and after dot we will really need to figure out a way so figure out the algorithm on how we are going to draw this rectangle shape here so if you look at this rectangle shape you can really notice that it has the height that is going to be three of these symbols that our user has entered and that it has the width that is going to take four of these symbols that our user has entered for width okay so we are going to use nested for loop in order to solve this problem here and if you're not familiar with nested for loop I am going to link that video here because I have already made one video with nested forloops so make sure to watch that video and in this video I am going to really use that nested for loop in order to control height and width of our rectangle shape so we are going to have outer for loop which is going to really control this height and then for each iteration of our outer for loop we are really going to control this wit with another loop and we are going to count from 1 up to 4 because 4 is the width that our user has entered and throw that shape in each iteration of our inner for loop ok so that is what we are going to do so let's now translate that into code I'm going to say here first thing that we need is going to be from our user to enter width and height so I'm going to declare two variables the first one is going to be height like this and then with okay so let's write out a message to our user so that he knows that he should enter height okay now let's accept that height value in our height variable and after that let's really copy this and do the same thing for our width like this and accept that value in our width variable so that is the first step the second step is going to be to declare another variable which is going to hold the symbol that our user wants to use for drawing that shape so I'm going to declare a variable of type char and I'm going to call it symbol like this and let's write out a message to the user so that he knows that he should enter that symbol like this and let's say C in symbol so after we have acquired all the necessary inputs from our user which are height width and symbol that we are going to use to draw our shape now we are left to write the algorithm that is going to draw that rectangle shape so as I already said for that we are going to use nested for loop so I am going to setup my outer loop the first loop and I'm going to say for and then I'm going to declare the counter which is going to count the iterations of my outer loop since that outer loop is going to control the height of our rectangle I'm going to say int age so I'm going to give the age name to our outer counter and I'm going to set its initial value to zero like this and then we are going to put the condition how long our outer loop is going to run it so while our age is less than height that our user has entered like this and then after each iteration of my outer loop we have to increment the value of our age counter so that would be the setup of our outer loop and let's now set up our inner loop so I'm going to write for and for this inner loop I'm going to declare another counter which I'm going to call W like this because this inner loop is going to control the width of rectangle shape so I'm going to set its initial value to zero as well and then I'm going to say that it is going to run while this w is less than what that our user has entered like this and also after each iteration we really need to increment the value of this W okay so what we are going to do in this loop so in this inner loop if you look at this image here where is it okay here you can really notice that in each iteration of our inner loop it just draws this symbol that our user has entered so I am going to very quickly just see out so right that symbol out I'm going say C out and then write out that symbol like this and there is really one more thing that we need to put and there is going to be after this for loop so this outer for loop finishes single iteration we really need to put something else at the end so here at the end of our outer for loop and let's look at our image so as you can see here after each iteration of our outer for loop because it is controlling high and it is really iterating through this inner for loop in each iteration of our outer for loop at the end of that iteration of outer for loop we really need to put empty space so here I need to put empty space and that corresponds to this line here so here I'm going to write out C out and line like this and now if I run my program we should really expect to see the shape that rectangle shape off dimensions that our user defines so let's say for height four and then for width let's say for example six and the symbol that we want to use to draw that shape let's say that that is going to be this plus symbol okay so as you can see our rectangle has the height of four and then it has the width of two four six so it has the width of six of these symbols that our user has entered okay so there is one more thing that I notice here and that is going to be really to format this shape to be a bit more pretty so for that we are going to use the library which is called IO manop so I am going to include that library here I have to say include IO map like this and this library here really contains a function that is that is called set W which means set width which is really going to set the width of the field that comes after it so I'm going to put here that function I'm going to say I'm going to put these redirection signs here and then in this space here I'm going to write out set V so set W actually and then here I want to put what is the width of the field that comes after this function so what is going to be the width of our symbol field and let's use three for a dot for example so if I run mine again but let me stop it first and if I run it again oh no I haven't stopped my program so I'm going to close it okay and now if I run my program you can see that it asks height and width I guess so previously we have entered four and six and then for the symbol let's enter plus again and now as you can see our shape looks much nicer because of this set width function because it has really assigned to each symbol to each character that our user has entered the width of three fields okay so let's run our program one more time and let's say that that height is going to be 5 and which is going to be 7 and let's enter another shape so let's say for example and as you can see it has written out the shape so the rectangle shape of these dimensions that our user has entered and it has used this symbol that our user also has entered so I hope that you enjoyed this video if you did make sure to subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon as well also if you want me to make more videos like this so if you want me to use programming to draw more shapes make sure to write that in the comments down below so that I can know that you really enjoyed this video and like it as well and code from this video I am going to put in the description so that you can find it there and use it if you need it and thanks for watching I'm going to see you in my next video bye
