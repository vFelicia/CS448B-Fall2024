hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video I want to show you how you can build your programming skills by building simple and small projects so in this video we will build one together and then also make sure to watch until the end because there will be some examples for you to practice so here is a quick demo of the application that we are going to build so here is the application that we want to build it has date time and then here we will put in a message and when we click set reminder it is going to remind us when that time comes so let's say that I want a reminder message at 1503 and let's say that I want to tell wake up and click set reminder and now we wait until 1503 okay so here is our message and now I'm going to show you how to build this app but before we start I have a surprise are you ready to take your programming skills to the next level because my programming course is coming soon and it's unlike anything you've ever seen before we are going to dive deep into programming and I will teach you about all of the concepts but not on individual small examples I will teach you how all of the programming Concepts work together and how they coexist to make big complex real world applications so this is going to be beginner to Advanced programming course and all of the things that you can already see on my YouTube channel are maybe three percent of this programming course and the remaining 97 are the things that you cannot find anywhere else on the internet so for those of you who watch my YouTube videos I want to give you a special discount so make sure to click the link in the description to secure your place because I have already published this news in my last video and a lot of people people have already signed up and unfortunately the number of people that can get a discount is limited so if you want one make sure to sign up now so let's go back to our project and see how we are going to build this application so to build this application I will use C plus Builder because it is the easiest and fastest way to build multiplatform applications with C plus so if you don't already have it I will put a link in the description so that you can download it and code along with me you could already see how our application is going to look like so let's start building it and let's start building user interface first so here in this palette I will drag and drop all of the controls that we need first of all we need date control so it's called T date edit I'll drag and drop it and then we need also time edit it's called T time edit drag and drop that as well okay and then we need the edit which is just a regular input field text box where you can write your message and we need button okay and another control that we need is called T timer and if you don't see it here make sure to delete this and then click on this Arrow which says show palette categories and select system and here under system you should be able to see tea timer so drag and drop that as well so here are all of the controls that we will need now I will just resize them a little bit and position them and then I will be back so here are all of the controls I've just repositioned them a little bit and also don't forget to change the names of all of these controls because we want to access them from our c plus code and we will do that by using their names so this control here is called reminder date and then this one here is called reminder time and then reminder message and our button is called set reminder button and I've also changed the text for our button it now says set reminder okay and this timer here also change its name and call it reminder timer like this so now what we need to do is implement the functionality for this set reminder button so I will double click on it and as you can see here we have Handler and inside this Handler we are going to describe what is going to happen when our user enters the date and time and reminder message and clicks set reminder so how are we going to implement this functionality first we need to get the values that our user has entered for date and time and then we will find the difference between that reminder date and time and the current time in order to get the remaining time until that message should be shown and we will use that remaining time as an interval for our timer so our timer will be set and it will count that remaining time and then it will show the message so let's start building that step by step so first I want to get the values the user has entered so I will say t date and I will call that variable reminder date okay and inside reminder date which is of type T date I will store the value from this field here I need its name its name is reminder date so I will copy that and go back here and here I will say reminder date and I will take date value from it okay this is how we get date now let's get time as well so I will say tea time and I will call it reminder time is equal to and I believe that this is called reminder time I'm correct okay so let's go back and let's say reminder time and then from this I want to take time like this okay now I want to join these two variables into one so there is a type called T date time like this and I will call this variable reminder date time okay reminder date oh my God this is time is equal to and there is a very easy way to join these two values you just say reminder date Plus reminder time okay let's do a little bit of formatting here okay so inside this variable now we have our reminder date and time the next step that I want to do is I want to find the difference between this reminder date time that our user has set and the current time and to determine current time there is a function called now so we will use that and this is how we are going to use it I will say the date time and call it remaining time okay and I will say that remaining time is equal to reminder date time minus now okay so this remaining time variable is going to store the difference between that reminder date time that our user wants this message to be shown at and the current time okay and we will store that value here so now we can set this difference as a timer and it is going to count count count and when it comes to that time it will show the reminder message but one important thing that we need to do before that is we need to convert this into milliseconds because this here is in date time format and our timer receives only milliseconds so how are we going to do that let me very quickly find something and then I will be back so this is what I've been looking for it's the number of milliseconds per day it's 86 million four hundred thousand okay why do I need this because the timer that we want to set receives only milliseconds so now we need to convert at this remaining time into milliseconds so how are we going to do that well let's first create a variable of type double and let's call it the remaining time in milliseconds let's say remaining time in milliseconds like this okay so how are we going to convert this into milliseconds it's very simple oh my God it is very simple check this out so I will multiply this remaining time with milliseconds per day but I first need to cast this to double because currently this is in date time format so I will use static cast and I will cast it to double type what I'm going to cast this so I need to put this into parentheses and I will multiply it by milliseconds per day like this okay and let's just move this into a new line like this so how does this work well very simple if this remaining time is an entire day when it is in date time format when you cast it to double then it will have the value of 1 1.0 so when you multiply 1.0 with this many milliseconds per day you will get exactly this many milliseconds which is one entire day so in this many milliseconds your reminder message will be shown and then if this is for example half a day when it is in date time format then when you convert it to double it is going to be 0.5 so when you multiply 0.5 by this many milliseconds you will get half of this so you will get 43 million and 200 000 which means that in that many milliseconds your reminder message will be shown and that many milliseconds is half a day so that is how this part here works and now what we can do is we can use this value here and set it as the interval for our timer so here I will say reminder timer and I will set its interval please make sure to use this Arrow because we are working with pointers here and this is a pointer so here I will say interval and its value is going to be this value here like this and the only remaining thing to do is to say that this reminder timer is now enabled so reminder timer enabled is equal to True like this so with this we have successfully set our timer so the next thing that we need to do is we need to define the behavior of our application when this time is reached so go to design file or your form Dot fmx and here you need to double click on your timer okay and you will get this function here and inside it we will Define two things first as soon as this timer is reached we want to disable it and second thing is we want to show that message to our user so let's go very quickly to our design file once more just to check the name of this timer it's called a reminder timer and I will go back to my CPP code and here I will say reminder timer enabled it's capital letter E enabled is equal to false so this means that from this point on our reminder timer will be disabled and the second thing was to show the message so I will say show message there's already a function for that and inside here I want to show whatever our user has typed into this edit field and the name of this edit field is reminder message so go back to CPP and here I will show reminder message text like this and make sure that it's capital letter T okay so that is the last thing and one more thing before we run this application is we actually want to start our application with this timer in disabled mode so inside your Constructor of the form you need to say that this timer will be disabled when the application starts because you want to control yourself when the timer should be enabled and that is here okay so now if I run this application let's see what's going to happen so here we need to select the date it's today's date so I don't want to change that I just want to change the time so let's say 14 57 and let's say wake up and here I will say set reminder and now we wait okay foreign and as you can see here is our message now one important thing that you should keep in mind is that this message can be a few seconds early or a few seconds late and that can be due to two things first one is that this code does need some time to execute and then second reason is that your system time does not necessarily need to be in sync with this time in perfect sync so if your notification is late or early that is potential reason so at the beginning of this video I promise to give you a couple of ideas on how you can practice programming on your own so now I'm going to do that this entire project was inspired by one of my reels this one so you guys asked me to help you implement some of these projects so I decided to do that right now and if you want to get more ideas and if you want to get more tips or best practices and things like that make sure to follow me on Instagram because I am a lot more active there because it's much faster to create content for Instagram so definitely add me there so that we can stay in touch between my YouTube videos the link for my Instagram profile will be in the description so thank you very much I hope that you enjoyed this video if you have any questions you can leave those in the comment section and if you want more videos like this one give this video a big thumbs up
