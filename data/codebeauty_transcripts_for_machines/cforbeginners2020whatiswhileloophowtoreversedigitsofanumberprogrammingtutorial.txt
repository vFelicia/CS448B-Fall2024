hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners and first things first make sure to subscribe to my channel and hit that Bell icon as well and share this video with everyone it really helps me to reach a lot more people and in this video I want to show you how you can reverse a number so your user is going to enter a number and what we want to do is we want to write out that number in Reverse so reverse the order of the digits of that number and here I have opened my visual studio so let's copy the text of this task like this and the first thing that we need to do is we need to really create a variable so let's say int number like this so that our user can enter his value in this variable here so let's write out a message to our user so let's say C out number like this so that our user knows that he should enter a number and then let's accept that value in our number variable Oh like this now after our user has entered a number well let's really think about how we are going to solve this problem okay I get it so the first thing that I notice here is that we are missing a variable and that variable is going to be the one that is going to hold our reversed number so let's declare it here I'm going to add it here and I'm going to call it let's say reversed number like this and I'm initially going to assign it a value of zero okay and know the algorithm that we are going to use in order to solve this task in order to reverse our number so the algorithm that we are going to use is going to be the following so this reverse number here it is holding a value of zero initially and this number here is the one that our user enters so let's say for example that our user enters a value of 123 like this so 1 2 3 so how we are going to reverse this number here the algorithm is going to be following so we are going to iterate through this number here so all the digits of this number here we are going to go through those and in each iteration we are going to do the following so the first thing is we are going to say please take this reverse number and multiply it by 10 so 0 times 10 is going to say to stay zero after that what we are going to do is we are going to take this last digit of our number that our user has entered and we are going to add that number to our reverse number so 0 plus 3 and that is going to be equal to 3 and after that we are going to really remove that last digit of our number so I'm going to delete that digit and then in our next iteration what we are going to do is the same thing so we are taking this reverse number we are going to multiply it by 10 so I'm going to say 3 times 10 that is going to be equal to 30 and after that we are going to take this last digit of our number and we are going to add that digit to this number here so to this reverse number so 30 plus 2 that is going to be equal to 32 and then we can really remove this last digit here so I'm going to delete it after that we are going to the third iteration and we are doing the same thing so we're taking this reverse number multiplying it by time so 32 times 10 is going to be equal to 320 and then we are taking the last digit of our number this is this one here and we have to add that digit to our reversed number so 320 plus 1 is going to be equal to 321 and after that as we did before we can really delete remove this digit here and then in my next iteration we are going to come here again and our loop is really going to see that there is nothing else left to iterate through so there are more digits and that it is really going to leave that loop and at that moment we are really going to have our reversed number so three two one that is reverse number from the one that our user has initially entered so let's now translate this algorithm into our code so the loop that we are going to use in order to solve this problem here is going to be while loop so I'm going to write while and then in these parentheses here I'm going to really give it an expression that is going to check each time that it wants to run an iteration and what we are going to iterate through are the digits of this number here so the number that our user has entered so I'm going to say please iterate through this part here so execute this block of code here which is currently empty while our number so number where is it is different than zero like this okay and inside here we are going to write out the algorithm that I just explained and the first step of that algorithm was really multiplying our reverse number by ten so I'm going to say reverse number is equal to reverse number times ten like this okay and the shorter way to write this expression here is going to be like this so you can really take this part here delete it and say it like this it is going to do absolutely the same thing so it is going to really multiply our reverse number by ten and then whatever that results in it is going to assign that back to our reversed number so that was the first step the second step in order to reverse our number is going to be really to take the last digit of this number that our user has entered so how can we do that we can do that by modulating this number here by 10 so I'm going to declare a variable let's call it last digit like this and as we already said we can get that digit if we modulate this number here where is it so this number that our user has entered right then okay that is going to give us the last digit of this number here and then what we really want to do is we really want to add that last digit to our reversed number that was one part of this algorithm so the next step so I'm going to say reversed number plus equal to last digit like this or you can write it a longer way but this way I prefer to write it this way but you can as well say reverse number is equal to reverse number plus last digit and after we have added that last digit or reverse number there is one more step left to do and that is to really take that last digit from our number and how we can do that well we can really do that by dividing or a number by 10 so you can say number that is equal to number divided by 10 or number divided equal to 10 whichever way you prefer okay so this is really the algorithm that we explained and this step here you can really write out the shorter way if you want so you can say for example reverse number plus equal to number modulated by 10 like this so you can make your code a bit more readable if you prefer it this way or you can leave this part here and then really add your last digit to your reverse number so now that we have done this algorithm here let's write out our reverse number and see what we have done so I'm going to write out C out and I'm going to say reversed like this okay and I'm going to write out our reversed number okay let me delete these empty spaces and if I run my program now it asks us to enter a number so let's enter number one two three and now if I press enter you can see that our program has really reversed this number here so let's quickly one more time explain how this has happened so our one loop has really iterated through this number here so that in each iteration it is going to do the following so it is going to take our reverse number and initially the Traverse number is equal to zero so it is going to multiply that by ten so it stays zero and after that is going to take the Traverse number and add it the last digit of our number that our user has entered so that is going to be in a first iteration number three so a reverse number in that case becomes three so zero plus three is equal equal to three and after that we are going to really take that last digit from our number that our user has entered so it has taken this three part away and then in the second iteration is coming here it is going to check again whether our number is not equal to zero and our number is going to be 12 in that situation so that is not equal to 0 so it enters here again it execute this block of code here so it says again please multiply my reverse number by 10 and assign that again to my reverse number so our reverse number was 3 and if you multiply by 10 if you multiply 3 right then you are going to get 30 after that it is taking the last digit of the number that our user has entered which is 2 now because 3 we have taken away in our previous iteration so it is going to add that 2 to my reversed number so number reverse number is going to become 32 now and then it is really going to take that last digit from our number away it is going to divide it by 10 so now we are left with number 1 and our reverse number is equal to 32 and then it goes back to our third iteration it checks again where there are numbers so whether our remaining number is equal to zero and this one here is the value of our number so that is not equal to zero so this condition here is fulfilled it can enter the while loop so it does this algorithm here again so it says please multiply my reverse number by ten our reverse number at this point is 32 so when you multiply that by 10 you get 320 and then after that it takes the last digit of our number which is going to be this one so this one here which is the last one remaining so it is going to take this one and add it to my reverse number as you can see here and then it is really going to take that last digit away so it is going to take all of these three digits away so it has taken them in the previous situations and now it has taken this one away as well so our number is equal to zero now and then it goes back to our fourth iteration it checks whether our number is not equal to zero but in this situation our number is equal to zero so it really leaves this loop here so it is not going to enter in this loop anymore and that it goes here and it really writes out the value of our reversed number which is this line of code here so that is how we have reversed our number so I hope that you liked this video and that you understand this explanation if you have any questions write those in the comments down below and also share this video with
