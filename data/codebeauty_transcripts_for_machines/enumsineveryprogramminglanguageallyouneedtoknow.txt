hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video i want to talk about enumerations or enums so let's get straight to the point so what is an enumeration you can understand enumeration as a special data type that consists of two parts an integer value and then a name that is used in order to describe that integer value so there are situations in real life where we use enouns without even being aware of it for example when you are ordering a lunch so you go to the food ordering machine and let's say that you see three options number one is pizza and then number two is burgers and then number three is pasta so that is an example where each number has a word in order to describe it so that you understand what is each option so the reason why enums exist is to make programmer's life easier because computers don't have any problem with remembering numbers but for us humans it is much easier to remember words that have meaning so the example that i gave where you have only three dishes it's kind of easy to remember when it's only three what each number represents but if you had an entire restaurant's menu with over 100 dishes then it would be very hard to remember which number represents which dish so that is the reason why enums were created in programming so that you can store something as an integer you can treat it as an integer in your program but again you have that word to describe what that integer means so now i'm going to show you how to create enum and how to work with enums in c plus but before i start writing the code i want to show you the extension that i'll be using in this video it is visual studio extension called visual assist and i often get questions related to how i write code how i avoid errors and what are some good extensions and productivity tools to use with visual studio so the one that i like is called visual assist and it is a great productivity tool that helps you with writing code reading code refactoring navigation and you can also use it to generate c plus code and also c and c sharp code so basically it improves visual studio experience by quickly identifying and fixing errors in your code and many senior developers use it and it also has great support for unreal engine so if your plan is to make games then you should definitely try it out and i'm going to leave a link that you can use to download it in the description and then if you want to see how to install it and learn about some very cool features that i like about visual assist i'm going to link a video in the upper right corner and i'll also link it in the description so that you can check it out and now i'm going to show you how you can create enums and work with enums in order to create an enumeration you say enum and then you give it a name let's say i color and then you need to put curly brackets like this and at the end you need semicolon so with this you have created an enumeration called eye color and it is empty for now so inside these curly brackets i am going to put the members for this enum and the members are going to be all the eye colors that i know off so let's say brown and then let's say blue and then green gray um and then heterochromia i believe that is when the eyes have different color like this and then let's say other for other eye colors okay so with this you have created an innovation called eye color and here are all of the eye colors that this enumeration contains so now your question might be salvina you said that each word represents a number so where are those numbers what number is for example this brown color so let's write a program that is going to give us the answer to that question so what i want to do is i want to create a variable that will be of this enum type so it will be of type i color and then i want to assign a specific value so some of these values to that variable and then we will print that variable in order to see which number or what we are going to get so let's do that here inside my main function i'm going to say eye color and i will create a variable called my eye color okay and here i will say that eye color will be brown because that is my eye color okay so if i say see out my eye color what do you expect to get if i run the program please pause the video and write your answer in the comments before i start this program so if i run this program you can see that we get the value of 0 so i wasn't flying after all and indeed these eye colors these eye colors here are represented as numbers and the numbers have been assigned by default so they start with zero the first member of your enumeration has the value of zero and then they increment by one which means that blue is one green is two gray is three and then four and five so those are default values that are assigned to the members of enumerations and then you can also assign your own values so how do you do that well you just say let's say blue is going to be equal to 5 and then this means that all the members after this value that we have changed are going to change as well so now green is going to be 5 plus 1 which is 6 and then gray is going to be seven eight and then nine and this one will be unchanged so if i run my program again you can see that brown is still zero but if i change this to other for example and if i run my program again you can see that we get the value of nine so blue is five this is six seven eight and there is your answer y other eye color so every other eye color will have the value of 9 okay so for the rest of this video i want to delete this value of 5 for blue and i want to assign the value of 1 to brown and by doing that you have assigned the value of 2 to blue and then 3 to green 4 5 and 6 to this member and you can also explicitly say 2 and then three and so on but again you don't have to because those values are going to be assigned by default when you assign the value of one to brown quick digression uh if you watch the video until this part i'm very curious to know what is your eye color so let me know in the comments but don't write the word write the number instead and the reason is because it's kind of funny for me to read the comments of people who don't watch the entire video and how they get confused with the comment section sometimes and the reason why i'm okay with trolling this way is because i make these videos for people who really want to learn programming and who really want to understand a certain concept and remember how to apply it later instead of making a video for someone who just wants to write a quick answer for his homework and then completely forget about it in five minutes so you have my permission to troll in the comment section as well just don't be rude and another reason why i asked you to comment your eye color in the format of number rather than a string is because of the following when you ask the user to input his eye color he is also going to enter a number so whatever user is entering a value for enum he inputs an integer and then later you need to convert or cast that integer into your enum type so let me show you how to do that on an example so what i want to do is i want to get a number from my user so i want to ask him hey what is your eye color and then he will input a number between 1 and 6 and then i will convert that number into this enum type so let's delete this code and i will create a variable of type int i will call it user input and then i will say c in user input like this so the user will enter an integer that is going to be his eye color an integer between 1 and 6 and then i need to cast or convert that integer into this enum type so let's create a variable of type eye color let's call it my eye color i'm going to delete this and then the value that i want to assign to this variable will be this integer here so i will say my eye color will be equal to user input but if i try to do this directly we will get an error um let's check that error here okay and the error says a value of type in cannot be assigned to an entity of type eye color so you cannot do this directly what you have to do instead is you need to convert or cast this integer into this eye color enum and then you can assign this to my eye color variable so now i'm going to very quickly pause this video and add a short description for every eye color that we have here and then i will be back to explain the code that i added so here i added a switch case and if you are not familiar with what switch case is i'm going to link a video in the upper right corner and i'll also link it in the description so that you can watch it and learn everything that you need to know about switch case so basically what i'm doing here is i say please check what value is stored inside my eye color variable and in case that it is brown you need to print this text in case that it is blue you need to print this text and then for green you need to print this and then gray heterochromia and other and then at the end of each case please don't forget to put break statement because if you don't you can get an error and again if you want to learn about errors that can happen in this situation please watch the video that will be linked in the description related to switch case so basically this is how you use enumerations with switch case and that is one of the most common uses and the most common examples where you are going to see enumerations so now if i run this program the following is going to happen our user first needs to input his eye color number and then we are going to cast that eye color into this enum type and then i will use that my eye color enum variable in order to switch on it and i will determine which one of these cases it is and i will print adequate text for that eye color so let's run the program and here we should enter a number so i will say one and if i press enter we are going to get this text here which says that 70 of the population has brown eyes making it the most common eye color worldwide scientists believe that everyone on earth had brown eyes around 10 000 years ago and people with brown eyes are less likely to develop eye cancer macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy than those with lighter colored eyes okay that's great to know uh being a person with brown eyes myself and if you have some other eye color you can input another number and you will get a description for your eye color and i will also paste all of this code in the comment i'll pin it in the comments which you can use it if you want an important thing to keep in mind is that there are certain scenarios where you can reproduce a bug in this program and that would be if the user doesn't input a number between 1 and 6 in this line here so if the user inputs a number that doesn't exist inside this eye color enumeration you would have a bug so how can you prevent that bug from happening how can you fix it well there are two ways to do that the first one is to use a loop so that you can force your user to enter the number again and again and again until he inputs a number that exists inside this eye color enumeration so a number between one and six that would be the first way and the second way to handle the error if it happens is to use something called try catch which is used to handle exceptions and errors in your code and i will link both of those videos in the description so that you can watch it and figure out how to fix this bug that we have here i'm going to leave that for homework to you and if you manage to fix it uh please put it in the comment section so that other people can use it as well and so that i can review it okay so that is a bug that can happen in this program and those are two ways how to fix that bug and one final thing that i want to show you because it is used very often and because you will see it very often in programming is how to iterate through the members of an enumeration so in order to do that i will use for loop and i will delete this code here we don't need it anymore i will just keep this switch case okay so in order to iterate through an enumeration you use for loop like this and inside this for loop i will declare a variable of type int i will call it my i so the same name here my eye color i have it here and i will initially assign it the value of brown because that is the first eye color that i have inside my enumeration and then i will say my eye color is different than other and i will say my eye color plus plus like this and inside these curly brackets of my for loop i will put this switch case i'll actually just move this curly bracket at the end of switch case like this okay and with this we are going to iterate through every single eye color we will check which eye color is in the current iteration and we will print the description for that eye color and another thing that i want to do at the end is i want to print two end lines like this so that our text is formatted nicely so let's see what we have achieved by using this for loop in order to iterate through the members of an enumeration and then putting this switch case inside for loop so if i run the program okay we get the description for every single eye color that we have in our program okay and one very important thing to keep in mind is that if you are going to iterate through your enumeration like this so that in each iteration you increment the enum by one then these also have to be incremented by one so one two three four five six and so on so you cannot all of a sudden have 22 here for example because then you will get a bug so if i try to run the program now let's just close this okay and now if i scroll you can see that here we have the value for brown eyes and then here we have green eyes blue eyes are missing here because we changed the value to 22 here and that completely changed the behavior of our program so the general recommendation is to leave default values here or to have them increment by one like this if you are going to iterate through the members of your enumeration like this another very important thing that i would like to show you is how to use enumerations with functions and this is probably the most important and the most common use of enumerations in programming so let's delete this code here and then this also and what i want to do is i want to move this part of the code into a function so let's create a function here of return type void let's call it get eye color details like this and inside here i will move this part of the code paste it here like this and this function will receive a parameter that will be of enum type so here i will say eye color and i will call that parameter my eye color like this so what we have achieved with this is now i can do the following i can say get eye color details and here i can pass you see the values brown gray green heterochromia and other so let's say blue here is blue okay so now if i run the program we should get the details for blue eye color okay so now your question might be salvina why is this important it is very important because by using enumerations you define which values are legal to use and this means that when you forget about this code in a month or two or if you're working in a team and other people also read and maintain your code it will be much easier for them and for you to understand what will happen when you have a code like this instead of having a code like this for example so this is also valid and you could create a function that is called get eye color details 2 that receives integers so let's create that function i'll just copy this part here and then paste it and here i will say get eye color details 2 and it will receive an integer okay and here instead of receiving brown blue green gray let's say case one case two case three four five and six okay and now let's comment this part here and this code as well it will work so if i stop the program that we previously read and then i run it again as you can see again we get through the same result we get the result for blue eye color but this code here is much harder to understand than this code here so if you don't make it easier for yourself when you are writing the code then it will definitely be harder tomorrow or in a month or two when you need to come back and read this code in order to fix a bug or add a new feature so in this situation you always need to open that function and then read it in order to figure out what is happening and what this number two means whereas in this situation here you don't really need to go to the details of the function in order to know what this parameter here means now i know that some of you might ask okay salvina but what about using strings can i do something like this can i say for example get eye color details three and then pass this as a string okay well the direct answer is that you cannot really do this in c plus plus because the way that c plus plus compares strings is very specific but if you're watching this for the purpose of understanding enumerations in some other programming language then this function would look something like this so get eye color details and then here you can use cons chart pointer or you can use string and here you are switching on a string and here you have string cases brown blue green gray heterochromia and all of that is in the format of string so what is the problem here well the problem is following even if your programming language allows you to do this which c plus doesn't allow as you can see you can see all of these errors then you would have the following problem so you invoke that function and you pass a string to your function so it goes here and then it finds this blue case so it prints this value okay it works in that case but what if i do something like this what if i say for example gray will this work well the answer is yes it will work because we have gray here but what happens if someone else tries to type gray like this which is also something that a person could do because some people spell it with a some people spell it with e so what will happen in this situation here because gray with an e like this it doesn't exist inside this switch case so you will get a bug so this option here will not work and neither will options like brown with all uppercase or brown with all lowercase or for example if someone has red eyes so he types red and tries to invoke this function you will have a problem so again the best way to solve that problem is to use a function that receives enum type like this one does so this is our function so when you try to invoke that function here you will get all the valid options so if i type b you will get blue or brown those are options that exist inside this function so let's say blue so this is an important use of enumerations in programming which means using enumerations with functions using enumerations as parameters of functions because by using enumerations you increase compile time checking of your code and you avoid errors that can happen by using invalid constants like numbers and strings and this is because enumerations let you define which values are valid or legal to use in your program so here only the members of our enumeration are valid to use and other values are not and it is much better to know that during the compile time so while you are still writing your code rather than getting that error once your user runs the program and then the program crashes and he doesn't have absolutely any idea why the program has crashed so that would be all for this video if you enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up so that i know to make more videos like this one in the future and if you have any questions you can let me know in the comment section and then if this video was helpful for you make sure to share it with someone else who would also like to learn programming so all the code from the video will be pinned in the comment and then everything else that you need from this video i will put that in the description and then you can watch the videos that will be on the screen here i hand picked those videos for you and they are the best way for you to continue upgrading your programming knowledge so thank you very much for watching and i will see you in some other video bye
