hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video C++ for beginners and in this video I wanted to talk about loops more specifically about while loop so what are loops what are they used for how they're used while loops are used when you want to execute a block of your code multiple times while a certain condition is true which means you give a certain condition to your loop and you say you are going to execute this block of code while this condition here is true so however many times it is necessary and one thing that I want to mention before we start on our example is the following so selection sequencing and iteration those three are three main building blocks of programming languages and when you really learn and understand those three you should be able to solve any logical programming problem and in this video we are going to talk about iteration we have already talked about sequencing and selection in my previous videos so what is sequencing well that means that your code is executed sequentially which means well mine after the other and then selection that would be really when you want to select one part of the code rather than the another one which means you are going to talk to your program and the research in certain situation it really has to select which block of code it is going to execute the same would be when you for example come to a crossroad and then you have multiple ways in front of you but you really have to select which one you are going to take because you cannot take all of them and then iteration is going to be really iterating or executing multiple times a certain block of code certain part of code while a certain condition is true so while a certain condition is fulfilled you are going to execute the same block of code so let's see our example now so I'm going to paste the text of my program here and this is our task so it says that we have to write out all numbers between 100 and 500 that are divisible by 3 and by 5 and how we are going to do that first I want to explain you the algorithm so how we are going to solve this problem and then we are going to translate that algorithm into our code so this interval here so this 100 to 500 interval we are really going to iterate through all of the numbers of this interval and we are going to do that using while loop and then for each of those numbers so for each value of our counter we are going to check whether that counter value can be divided by 3 and by 5 and if yes we will write out that value if now we are just going to continue to the next iteration so as I already said we are going to use while loop to solve this problem and we are going to start our vile loop with the counter value of 100 and in each iteration we are going to really increase the value of our counter so 101 102 and 3 and we are going to stop the execution of our while loop when this counter value comes from 100 to 500 and 1 which means 500 value of counter is going to be our last iteration through our loop so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to really declare a variable that is going to hold our current counter value so I'm going to call it int counter like this and initially I'm going to set the value of my counter to 100 okay so this is our initial value of our counter and then let's see what is the syntax of I'll of our while loop so we write out while like this and then in these parenthesis we are going to put our condition so how long our loop is going to execute and then in these races here so in this curly brackets we are to put which block of code our while loop is going to execute while this condition here is fulfilled and let's now fill these parentheses here so as I said our counter has to go from 100 to 500 which means since it starts on 100 here we have to say to our while loop that the execution of this block of code here really has to stop what our counter comes to 500 or 501 500 is still valid value so that we are going to say like this so we are going say counter like this and that we are going to say there are two ways to write this condition the first one is to say while our counter is less or equal to 500 or you could as well said while our counter is less than 501 so that is a valid situation while you're executing your loop so while your counter is less than 501 or while your counter is less or equal to 500 I prefer it this way but whichever way you put it is going to work so now that we have put this condition here we really can write out this code that comes in this while loop block so what we are going to execute while this condition here is true and that is going to be following inside this block of code here we really have to check whether our current value of our counter is divisible by 3 and by 5 and if it is we have to write out that number to our user if now we just need to continue to our next iteration of our loop and how we can check whether this counter value can be divided by 3 and by 5 well we use modulo operation for that if you haven't watched my video on operators I'm going to link it here make sure to watch it and here we really put the following so we can say if and also if you are not familiar with if statement going to link it here so if our countervalue so our current value of our counter after you modulate it with three if the result of that is zero that means that our number so our counter is divisible by three and we also have to check whether our counter is divisible by five as well we use this modulo operation here and we say whether our counter modulated by five is going to equal to zero and if this condition here is fulfilled we really have checked this part of our task and if this part here is true we have to write out that number so in this situation here I'm going to say C out like this and I'm going to put inside here let's see we are going to write out the value of our counter like this and we are going to write out is divisible like this and let's put one end line after this line of code here because we are definitely going to have multiple lines so we want our lines to be formatted nicely okay so this part of code here has really covered this divisible by three and five and write out that number if it is divisible by three and by five and there is really one very important thing that you have to keep in mind each time that you write loops and that is the following so you have to give your loop a way so that it can stop executing this block of code here so under a certain condition it really needs to leave this block of code here because if you don't do that you are going to end up with an infinite loop you are really going to lock your program in an infinite loop situation and this code here this loop here that we have written this is really an infinite loop so let me prove that I'm going to run my program and as you can see the console is empty so I enter any value enter whatever it is not really reacting and why has that happened well your counter value starts with 100 and then it comes to your while loop and your while loop checks this condition here so it checks whether your 100 is less or equal to 500 and the answer to that is yes which means that your program execution can enter this block of code here so it can start executing your loop and then it comes here and it says please check whether my counter which is 100 is divisible by 3 and the answer is no so this part of code here is not even going to be checked because of the nature of this end operator it really needs both of these operands to be true in order for this expression here to be true because this here is not true it's false a hundred is not divisible by 3 it is not even going to check this condition here and this line of code here is not ever going to be written so after that it comes here to this closed curly brace and then because of the nature of while loop when it comes here it really goes back here and then it checks again your value of your counter whether that is less or equal to 500 but nothing has changed your counter value is still 100 and then it is going to enter again here and then really repeat that process over and over again and your program because of that is going to be locked inside an infinite loop so let me prove that really because here we have an empty console and you cannot see what is happening in the background so I'm going to stop my program and I'm going to write out here let's write out see out like this and let's write out infinite loop and if I run my program now as you can see your program has really entered in an infinite loop and it is writing out this infinite loop text for infinite number of times so as you can see it says infinite loop okay and this execution here is not really going to stop until your programs memory is full and then it's going to crash so whatever code indicates that you had some code here it is not ever going to be executed so I'm going to stop this here and I'm going to delete this part of good here because we don't really need it what we need is we need to put here a certain code that is going to help our loop to really stop the execution at the certain point and the code that we need to put here is going to be really Foley it's going to be counter plus plus like this what this code of here this code here is going to do in each iteration it is going to check whether this condition here is true if yes it is going to write out this part of code here and then in each iteration it is going to really increase the value of your counter by one which means in your first iteration is going to be 100 after that it's going to be 101 102 103 and it is going to really go until it comes to 500 that is going to be the last iteration of your program and then when it comes to 501 this condition here is not going to be true anymore and then your loop is going to check really whether 501 is less or equal to 500 and the answer to that is not going to be no so your program is going to really stop the execution of this loop and come here and then really stop your program so if I run the program now I'm going to prove that okay so this has been executed very fast and as you can see this is the result of your program it has really written out all the numbers that are divisible by 3 and by 5 and you can check all of these numbers using your calculator if you want so with this expression here with this counter plus plus we have really both iterated through all the numbers between 100 and 500 because we check our counter value here and that also we have we have really given a way to our loop to stop the execution of this block of code here when this counter value comes to 501 and this is the result of our program okay so I hope that you have liked this video any questions that you have write those in the comments down below and I'm going to ask for those make sure to subscribe to my channel and share it with all your friends anyone who would like to learn programming and I'm going to see you in my next video bye
