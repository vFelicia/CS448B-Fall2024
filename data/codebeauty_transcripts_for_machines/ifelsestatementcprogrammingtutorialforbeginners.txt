effort and dedication for the next few months it can truly truly transform your life so with that being said let's continue with the topic of this video and let's learn about if else Expressions if else in C and in any other programming language is used to make decisions if something is true then do this else do that for example if it is sunny then go to the beach else sleep all day so now let's see the simplest example so let's write here let's say if 1 is equal to one what I want to do is I simply want to write some text in my console I want to write for example one is equal to one like this so this is how you write an if expression if and then inside parentheses you put condition and when this condition is evaluated it is going to result in either true or false and if it results in true then this part of the code will be executed so now if I run the program let's see what will be the result okay so here we get this output one is equal to one because this condition here is true but if I change this for example and I say please check if 1 is equal to two and I run my program again as you can see we don't have this output anymore we just have this last line of code which will be executed in any case because this line of code is not under any if condition okay so let's stop our program and let's go once more through this codee so we say if and then inside parentheses you put condition and then inside these curly brackets you put the code that will be executed if this condition here is true okay inside these curly brackets you can have as much code as you need so that can be just one line of code like we have here or it can be 100 lines of code depending on what your program needs to do now something interesting is that if you have only one command inside these curly brackets you can completely delete them and your program is going to behave absolutely the same so if I start my program again as you can see we get the same behavior but what I prefer to do is I prefer to have these curly brackets because it makes the code more organized and what is important to remember is that if you have more than one command inside these curly bra ETS then you must have them you cannot delete them otherwise you will have logical errors in your program now let's write another example let's delete this if and let's say Bull have cat is equal to True okay and what I want to do is I want to check if have cat is equal to true then what I want to do is I want want to print some text what text well let's say feed your cat like this okay so if I start the program as you can see we get this output because have cat is equal to true now something interesting that you can do here is you can make this even shorter so you can just write if have cat without this part here and the program will behave absolutely absolutely the same so if I delete this and run my program again as you can see we get the same behavior now if I change this to be false and I run the program again as you can see this line of code will not be executed because remember what we said in order for this code here to be executed this condition needs to be true and because it is false this block of code will not be executed okay so this is the most simple example of how you can use if expressions in order to make decisions in your program so if something is true then do this part of the code now I'm going to show you how you can use if else expression so here after this closed curly bracket I will write else and then inside another pair of curly brackets we will write the code that will be executed if this here is not true so let me copy this line of code okay and here I will say get a cat cats are awesome okay so what this code here does is the following it checks if you have a cat and if you do then it will write this line of code else meaning if you don't then it will write this line of code so let's start our program okay and here it says get a cat cats are awesome because this variable is false but if we change it to true and we start our program again as you can see now this line of code is executed now a few things to remember and a few common mistakes that beginners make are are following please don't put semicolon here or here or something like that because if you do you will have errors in your program so if I try to run my program as you can see we have buil errors so please make sure that you follow the correct syntax if and then inside these parentheses you put the condition and then inside these curly brackets you put what will be executed if this here is true and then you say else and inside another pair of curly brackets you put what will be executed if this here is false so that is first important thing to remember and then second important thing to remember as you could already see if expression can exist without else expression but not vice versa so you cannot have else expression without if so this here will give you a logical error if I start this program as you can see we have built errors but once more like this it is okay and also if without else can exist but else condition without if condition does not make sense okay now let's go to some more complex examples because what we can do is we can chain these we can have multiple if else Expressions so let me delete this code and here I will write Double Cat weight is equal to let's say 5 kg okay so what I want to do is I want to check if cat weight is less than let's say four kilog what I want to do is I want to print that is a small small cat so here I will write this is a small cat okay and then what I want to do in case that cat's weight is not less than 4 kilg I want to check something else I want to say else if so if this here results as false then please check the condition inside these parentheses so what will be the condition here well here I will say cat weight is greater than or equal to 4 kg okay and at the same time cat weight is less than 6 kilg for example okay so in that case I want to print another line of code so here I will say this is an average size cat Okay and then at the end I want to put final else block and inside it I will say this is a big cat what sound is that so let's start this program okay and as you can see it says this is an average sized cat because cat's weight is five so what we do is we first check if cat weights is less than four it is not so we proceed and we check this condition here so we check if cat's weight is greater than or equal to four and at the same time less than six is is and for that reason this line of code here will be printed and then this else block here will not be executed now if I change this cat weight to be two for example and I start the program again now we get a different output we get this is a small cat so again we first check this condition here and if it results as true we will execute this block of code and nothing else will be executed otherwise if this here results as false then we proceed and we check this second condition and if the second condition results as true we will execute this line of code and then nothing else will be executed but if this here results as false then we will execute this final else block and it does not have any conditions so in case that this is false and this is also false then else block will be executed Ed now your question might be okay Salina how many of these if El's can I chain and the answer is that you can chain as many as you want as many as you need but after some point it can become very hard to understand if you have more than let's say four or five if El's that are chained and depending on what you need to do and what you want to achieve there are better ways to do that for example one way is to use switch case and you can learn more about switch case in this video here it will also be linked in the description so you can watch it after this video but as I said you can change as many as you want but if you make it too many then your code is going to be hard to understand and hard to maintain but what you can do is you can say here for example else if and then you can add another condition here for example let's say if cat weight is greater than or equal to six and then less than then eight this is a big cat and then again at the end you can put a final else block and inside that you can write let's say this is a really really big cat Okay and one interesting thing that I mentioned before is that you don't need to have this final else block if you don't want to and if you don't need it in your program so else if can exist without any problems without the final else but what this final else does is it serves as a default situation so if all of these fail if all of these result as false then at the end this here will be some sort of backup default option that will be executed so in this case you are checking the size of the cat you are checking if the cat is small cat or average sized cat or big cat or if none of these are true then it is really really really big cat but as I already said creating a really long chain of these if else if else if and so on it is going to make your code hard to understand and hard to maintain and already with just one two three four of these we have a code that looks a little bit bulky and much harder to understand than it was previously so once more try to avoid as much as possible to chain a lot of if El's another interesting and important thing that you can do with if El's besides chaining them is you can also Nest them so what does that mean that means that for example inside this if block you can have another if else or another chain of if eles so let me think of an example and then I will show you for example let's add another variable let's say double cat age and let's say that cat will be 3 years old so what I want to do is inside this if condition here I want to also check what is cat's age so I will say if cat age is let's say greater than two well in that case if Kat is older than two but it has less than 4 kilograms that means that it is underweight so I will print that message I will say cat is underweight please feed it more okay else which means that if cat is not older than 2 years old in that case it is of normal weight so I will say cat is of normal weight okay okay so what this code here does is it checks if cat's weight is less than four if it is it will print that that is a small cat so still a baby and then it will check if cat is older than 2 years old because if it is older than two but it has less than 4 kilg then it is going to print that cat is underweight you need to feed it more else which means that if cat is not older than two in that case the cat is of normal weight and then if the cat is not less than 4 kg it will simply continue and check all of these other things so if I run this program let's see what is going to be the result okay here it says this is a small cat and cat is underweight please feed it more the reason is because cat's weight is two that is less than four and then the age of cat is three which means that it is older than two so it should defin itely weigh more than 4 kilg but if I change the age of this cat so for example I say that cat is 1 years old so it is still a kitten and I run the program now it says that cat is of normal weight so it is a small cat and it is of normal weight so what you can do now is you can add some additional checks inside these L's if blocks and you can check for these cats if they are underweight over overweight or of normal weight and an interesting thing that we learned in the previous video is how you can handle input and output so now what you can do is you can ask your user to enter cat weight and cat age and depending on what he enters you can print one of these messages and analyze his cat so I would like to invite you to watch that video it's going to be linked here and also in the description and then try to solve that problem on your own so what I want you to do is I want you to ask the user to input weight and age for the cat and then you can execute this code here with the values that the user has provided so please pause the video here try to solve it on your own and then you can watch my solution and if you need help the video about input and output is going to be in the description so here is my solution we first ask the user to enter weight of the cat and then we read whatever he enters and we store it inside this variable and then we ask about cat's age again we read what the user enters and we store that inside this variable here and then this remaining part of the code stayed absolutely the same so now let's run our program and see how this behaves okay so let's say that the cat is 5 kilg and it has 2 years and we get this message so this is an average sized cat and the reason for that is because cat is 5 kilogram so this condition here resulted as true and we got this message here now let's start again and let's change the value let's say that cat's weight will be 3 kg and the age of the cat will be 5 years so now we get this is a small cat and cat is underweight please feed it more because cat is 3 Kg so this condition here is true and then the age of the cat is greater than two so that means that cat is underweight and you need to feed it more and one interesting thing that I want you to notice is that I did not use curly brackets here nor here you can add them if you want but as I said if you have only one command under if you don't have to use curly brackets and also the same applies for else but if you wanted to add more than one command here or here then you would have to add curly brackets so I hope that you enjoyed this video and that this example helped you to understand if else expressions and if you want to learn more if you want to learn how to build real applications and if you want to start a successful career as a developer then you should definitely join code Beauty Academy where I will teach you everything that you need to know about programming so that you can finally start building applications off your dreams more details will be in the description and I can't wait for you to join our community and to start learning real programming so thank you very much for watching and I will see you in the next video bye
