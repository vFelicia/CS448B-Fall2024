00:00 - Jason or Json depending on who you ask
00:03 - however the creator of Json pronounces
00:05 - it Json stands for JavaScript object
00:07 - notation it's a Syntax for storing and
00:10 - exchanging data Jason that's how I say
00:13 - because Jason is my middle name has the
00:15 - following
00:16 - characteristics data is in name value
00:18 - pairs so here's the example here's the
00:21 - name here's the value here's the name
00:25 - here's the
00:26 - value and here's a name and here's a
00:28 - value d is also separated by commas so
00:31 - you have a comma after each piece of
00:33 - data curly braces hold objects so in
00:37 - this name value pair the value is an
00:40 - object also the entire thing is an
00:41 - object so you can see the curly braces
00:43 - and square brackets hold arrays like
00:46 - this adjacent values must be one of the
00:48 - following data types A String a number
00:53 - adjacent
00:54 - object an
00:56 - array a
00:58 - Boolean or or null Json values cannot be
01:03 - a function a date or undefined that's
01:07 - one of the differences between Json and
01:09 - JavaScript objects since the Json format
01:11 - is text only it can be easily sent to a
01:14 - server through URL when exchanging data
01:16 - between a browser and a server the data
01:18 - can only be text that's why Json can be
01:20 - very useful there are two important
01:22 - methods for using Json and JavaScript
01:24 - the stringify
01:28 - method if you you call json. string IFI
01:31 - and pass in some Json it converts it to
01:34 - a string so we just have a string right
01:37 - here often you'll stringify some Json
01:40 - before sending it to a
01:42 - server and the parse
01:54 - method whoops got this Comm in the wrong
01:58 - place so when we do json.parse and put
02:03 - in a string that's also in Json format
02:07 - it's going to give us an object it's
02:09 - going to convert it to a JavaScript
02:11 - object well that should give you a good
