00:00 - how do you get the current URL with
00:02 - JavaScript well there are a few
00:04 - different things I'm going to show you
00:05 - if you have this URL HTTP colon slash
00:08 - slash scars at CC / example / ends X
00:10 - slash HTML you can do window that
00:13 - location that protocol and that's going
00:15 - to give this the HTTP colon you can do
00:18 - window that location that host and
00:20 - that's going to give the card CC just
00:23 - that first part if you do the dot PAP
00:26 - name you can get everything after the
00:29 - the host name so the example dot slash
00:32 - index and if you do we know that
00:34 - location that H ref you might get the
00:36 - whole thing besides doing one at that
00:39 - location that href you can actually
00:41 - build it manually basically of our new
00:44 - your URL equals when to that location
00:46 - that protocol that's this one up here
00:47 - plus slash less plus one of that
00:50 - location that host which is the host and
00:52 - then you just add this last and on the
00:55 - path name you can also break up a URL
00:58 - into an array so you can access the
01:01 - components individually if you have you
01:03 - are like this where you can see it's J's
01:05 - nugget / is / awesome slash and next to
01:08 - HTML you can you can do a split on the
01:13 - slashes so each items between the
01:16 - slashes will be its own index in the
01:18 - array so then you can access different
01:20 - parts by just exiting path array and
01:23 - then putting the index of the part of
01:25 - the array that allows you to manipulate
01:27 - the the you have the different parts of
01:29 - the URL and if you want it after
01:30 - manipulating you can put them all back
01:33 - together however you want and you can
01:35 - also get the different parts of a URL
01:37 - using jQuery so this is the general
01:41 - thing eight to put of our x equals then
01:44 - you get the location dot a TDR and then
01:46 - you're gonna put the property what
01:48 - what's in here actually changes
01:50 - depending on what you want Francis if
01:52 - this is the URL and this is a little
01:54 - more components on the other example and
01:56 - then down here if you if you put host
01:59 - and place of where this property up here
02:01 - you're gonna get this part if you get
02:04 - hosting it if you put host name in place
02:06 - of that property you get this part and
02:09 - you can see free so you can get the pork
02:10 - the protocol the path name
02:12 - gaged ref just gives you the whole thing
02:14 - except it does not give you the this end
02:17 - part hash or search will give you
02:20 - everything after the question mark well
