00:00 - hi in this video we are going to cover
00:02 - computer security
00:04 - now in computer security there's a
00:05 - couple things that you guys might
00:07 - already know but you might not and how
00:08 - to keep your computer and your files
00:10 - safe
00:11 - now the first kind of thing we're going
00:13 - to talk about is something called a
00:14 - dictionary attack and this has to do
00:16 - with your passwords when you're creating
00:18 - a password some sites make you do you
00:21 - know a special character here and more
00:23 - than one number but non-sequentially and
00:25 - you know like you have to have an extra
00:27 - letter that doesn't i mean they could be
00:29 - really really specific on how
00:31 - complicated they have to be and it's
00:33 - actually a little bit unnecessary the
00:35 - kind of attacks they're trying to guard
00:37 - you from are these dictionary attacks
00:39 - which
00:40 - literally there are computers that are
00:42 - programmed to go down all of the words
00:44 - in the dictionary and try them as
00:46 - passwords for every username and
00:48 - assistant for example
00:49 - so
00:50 - if your password is kangaroo
00:53 - they're probably going to break into
00:55 - your account now most people's passwords
00:56 - are not this simple
00:58 - but
00:59 - that doesn't matter they're trying to
01:01 - mass attack everybody's account with
01:03 - this type of strategy and all they need
01:05 - is one or two people or one or two
01:06 - percent of the people to have these
01:08 - simpler passwords that are just a word
01:11 - or numbers that are in order
01:13 - now in general when you're creating a
01:15 - password
01:16 - you want to have some capitals some
01:18 - numbers
01:19 - some symbols sure but one of the best
01:21 - ways you can mix it up is just to throw
01:23 - some random letters in there to really
01:25 - make sure that it's not a word that
01:26 - they're going to find in a dictionary
01:28 - it's not a common name
01:30 - nothing that's too
01:31 - sequential if you will
01:34 - now phishing
01:35 - is have you forgotten one of those
01:37 - emails that's from like amazon or they
01:39 - say you're they're from visa and they
01:41 - need you to log in and fix something
01:43 - right now or else you're gonna lose your
01:46 - account you're gonna be fined and you
01:48 - know they come up with all these great
01:49 - reasons why you need to log in right now
01:51 - and they provide you the link fishing is
01:55 - something that generally targets the
01:56 - older population that doesn't know
01:58 - necessarily the difference between an
02:00 - actual amazon.com and what looks to be
02:03 - amazon.com
02:05 - there are two ways to safeguard yourself
02:06 - from phishing one
02:08 - look at the address in the browser if it
02:11 - says
02:12 - amazon.com you're probably safe it also
02:15 - should have an https that little green
02:18 - thing next to it to ensure that it is
02:20 - actually amazon another way to do it is
02:22 - to just exit that email open another
02:25 - browser go to amazon.com and see if
02:27 - there's any alerts there most likely
02:29 - there won't be unless it's obviously a
02:31 - real threat
02:33 - encryption and https now
02:36 - if you're at your bank or you're on your
02:38 - website for your bank maybe you're doing
02:40 - it from a public place maybe you're at
02:42 - starbucks and you're in the wi-fi you
02:43 - need to check your bank
02:45 - you might be worried about your password
02:46 - security and you should be
02:48 - anything that's sent along these packets
02:50 - might be intercepted by someone else
02:52 - what you want to look for is the https
02:56 - because that means that the site you're
02:57 - sending the information to is encrypting
02:59 - your information
03:01 - encryption is just a scrambling up of
03:04 - all the data
03:05 - and unless you have the code to unlock
03:07 - the encryption it's just googly arc just
03:09 - means nothing
03:11 - in general whenever you're showing
03:12 - private or sensitive information you
03:15 - want to check for an https to make sure
03:17 - your information is as safe as it can be
03:20 - i have a quick addendum about https
03:23 - while https will protect you from people
03:25 - outside of your network if there's
03:26 - anybody on your network who like is
03:29 - connected to your wi-fi or maybe
03:31 - wire with a wire connected to your
03:33 - internet connection https doesn't
03:35 - protect you from anybody there
03:38 - so you still want to be careful when
03:39 - you're on public wi-fi connection um a
03:41 - couple other general tips don't share
03:43 - passwords between important accounts uh
03:46 - say your password's a very strong
03:48 - password but if for example target.com
03:51 - gets hacked into and that password there
03:53 - is the same password you have for your
03:55 - bank and your email
03:56 - you might be kind of out of luck um also
04:00 - don't download strange files
04:03 - a lot of these kind of trojan or malware
04:06 - or viruses that happen are in files you
04:08 - need to download they disguise them as
04:11 - well as they can but if you're it's not
04:13 - from a trusted site uh you want to check
04:15 - for that dot pdf or dot txt or jpeg uh
04:20 - if you don't recognize that or it's not
04:22 - if you think you're downloading an image
04:23 - and it's not an image file format
04:26 - don't download it it's that's too fishy
04:28 - and once they're in there they can
04:29 - pretty much run your computer uh from
04:31 - the inside so it's pretty scary stuff
04:33 - um another way to keep yourself
04:34 - protected is keep your software updated
04:37 - specifically software that uses the
04:39 - internet and interfaces with the
04:40 - internet
04:42 - one way that the bad guys are trying to
04:44 - get into your computer is finding holes
04:47 - and gaps in security of older versions
04:49 - now those bugs have been patched in new
04:51 - versions so if you
04:53 - continuously update your security and
04:55 - update your software you're not going to
04:57 - have as many problems
04:59 - so these are really just like basic
05:00 - things basic things you should know
05:02 - about how to keep your information safe
05:04 - on your computer
