00:00 - jquery is a very popular lightweight
00:03 - javascript library the purpose of jquery
00:07 - is to make it much easier to use
00:09 - javascript on websites jquery simplifies
00:12 - a lot of the complicated things from
00:14 - javascript like ajax calls and dom
00:17 - manipulation
00:19 - to use it you can either download it and
00:21 - host it yourself or you can just link to
00:24 - a cdn
00:25 - a lot of people just use a cdn
00:28 - so to do that you just go into your html
00:30 - file and put this line so right within
00:33 - the head tag you can see we have the
00:34 - head tag here and inside that you're
00:36 - gonna put this line script and source
00:39 - equals and then you just link to the
00:41 - jquery here the jquery cdn if you can't
00:44 - remember what that is you can just go to
00:46 - google and type in jquery cdn and you
00:49 - can also download it from jquery.com
00:52 - and if you are creating something on
00:55 - codepen like i am right now there is an
00:57 - even easier way to add jquery you just
01:00 - go to settings
01:01 - and then on the javascript tab quick add
01:05 - you go down to jquery and you just click
01:09 - save and close and then you you don't
01:11 - even have to put the script here it adds
01:13 - it for you so down the javascript code
01:16 - here i'm going to show you the basic
01:17 - syntax of jquery you're always going to
01:19 - start with the a dollar sign and then in
01:22 - parentheses you're going to put a
01:23 - selector now this selector can be any
01:27 - css selector and then you're going to
01:29 - put dot and then you're going to put the
01:30 - action so whatever action you're going
01:32 - to have jquery perform with that css
01:36 - selector so to get rid of this i'm just
01:38 - about to copy and paste some code that
01:41 - has three jquery commands and we're
01:43 - going to talk about those okay so here
01:46 - are three jquery commands so this first
01:48 - jquery command is is kind of special
01:51 - you're usually going to want to put your
01:53 - entire code in a
01:55 - document.ready event so document.ready
01:58 - just means when the document is ready or
02:01 - when the document is completely loaded
02:05 - then you're going to run the rest of
02:06 - your code if you don't put your code in
02:08 - a document.ready event your code may try
02:11 - to access an element from the html that
02:13 - has not yet loaded so this just selects
02:17 - the document and when it's ready it runs
02:19 - this code so now let's look at the code
02:21 - inside the document.ready event again we
02:25 - start with the dollar sign and then with
02:26 - the css selector button is just going to
02:30 - select the the button
02:32 - tag right here
02:34 - and then we're going to add a click
02:36 - action or a click event so this is going
02:38 - to be the action click and when the
02:41 - button is clicked we're going to run the
02:43 - command that's inside that
02:46 - so inside
02:47 - we have another jquery command you know
02:51 - it's jquery because it starts with a
02:52 - dollar sign
02:53 - and then we're going to select the p
02:56 - tags
02:57 - and we're going to hide them so there's
02:59 - two p tags here you can see these two
03:01 - right here
03:02 - so if i click the belt button
03:04 - the p tags are hidden i'm just going to
03:06 - reset that and we're going to change the
03:08 - code a little bit so i'm just going to
03:10 - change this one right here i'm going to
03:12 - change this to serial with the hash sign
03:16 - or the pound sign right before this
03:18 - that's just the css selector for id
03:22 - so you can see up here id of serial so
03:25 - now it's going to select this whole
03:26 - thing right here so if we run that and
03:29 - then we click the button
03:31 - it just hid the paragraph element with
03:33 - the id of serial and you can see these
03:36 - two lines one of them is a has a
03:38 - paragraph tag one of them has a div tag
03:40 - but they both have the same class of
03:42 - unicycle so if we just use the css dot
03:47 - unicycle
03:48 - that's how you would show a class the
03:51 - dot if i click the button
03:53 - it hides everything that's unicycle and
03:56 - i'll show you one more way you can mix
03:57 - this up
03:59 - here we've been selecting the button to
04:02 - add the click event but we can also
04:05 - make this h3 so we can we can really add
04:08 - the click event to anything and now
04:10 - we're going to hide the button so let's
04:13 - see what happens there
04:16 - when i click the button now nothing
04:17 - happens but if i click the heading
04:20 - the button disappears okay that's just a
04:22 - quick introduction to jquery i'm going
04:24 - to be going over more information about
04:26 - jquery in future videos
