00:03 - Hi, I'm Brianna from free code camp and today we're going to talk about the basics of computer hardware
00:08 - computers are made up of four basic parts the
00:12 - Input/output CPU and memory the input is what you're putting into the computer. Think about mouse keyboard
00:21 - Microphone. Anyway, you're giving data into the computer the output is what you're watching on your monitor or listening to on your speakers
00:29 - These can both be any format like text numbers
00:32 - Videos images what have you it doesn't matter the CPU stands for central processing unit
00:38 - And that's what we all think of when we think of a computer
00:41 - It's what does the functions it's what runs a software it manipulates the data
00:46 - The memory is where we store data and information now the CPU has exclusive access to this memory
00:53 - You can get to the memory from the input or from the output without the use of the CPU
00:58 - so just review we've got four basic parts of a computer the
01:03 - input/output CPU and memory
01:09 - In addition to those four basic parts, we have three more things we're going to discuss today the motherboard
01:15 - expansion cards and power supply
01:18 - The motherboard is what connects everything while the data is flying around over here trying to figure out where to go
01:23 - The motherboard helps route it so it goes to the right place
01:27 - Expansion cards are sound cards video cards that kind of thing that can really up your experience as a user
01:34 - Power supply is as it sounds what gets power to the computer
01:38 - It's usually a part of the computer that has that fan on it to keep it from overheating
01:42 - so let's do a quick review in addition to the four basic parts of
01:46 - Input/output central processing unit and memory, we usually have a motherboard expansion cards and a power supply
01:57 - We're going to talk about the different types of computers
02:00 - the biggest type of computer we're going to talk about is a supercomputer, which maybe you've heard of a
02:05 - Supercomputer uses a whole bunch of CPUs and uses something called
02:10 - Parallel processing all of those CPUs work on the same problem at the same time
02:16 - The next type we're going to talk about is a server a server
02:20 - holds and accesses a bunch of data or programs
02:23 - Our website free code camp is hosted on a server which stores all that information
02:29 - Next let's talk about a workstation computer now a workstation computer just looking at it might look similar to a personal computer
02:36 - But it has a bunch more power and is way more expensive Toy Story was built on
02:43 - workstation computers
02:44 - Now personal computers by far the most common type of computers
02:49 - Maybe you've heard I'm a Mac. I'm a PC something like they're different but really this map is still just a PC
02:57 - It's a it's a personal computer. It's still a book the Mac and a PC
03:02 - The last type of computer we're going to talk about is a microcontroller
03:07 - microcontroller that's the type of tiny computer you might have in your car that has a really
03:12 - Specialized task and is really good that one small thing but it's not like you could use it like a regular personal computer
03:19 - So just to review
03:20 - 5,000 computers
03:22 - supercomputer server workstation PC and microcontroller
03:30 - We're going to be talking a little bit more about the motherboard now the motherboard we mentioned briefly
03:35 - We're going to go into a little bit more detail today
03:38 - So what makes a motherboard is the connection between the CPU?
03:42 - And the memory if there's no connection between the central processing unit and the memory
03:47 - We can't call it a motherboard but most motherboards do a lot more than that primarily
03:53 - they have expansion slots and
03:55 - Ports now expansion slots are where you put anything that can increase the performance of the computer
04:02 - without putting more load on the CPU
04:05 - For example a graphics or a sound card would up your user experience by giving you a better video or better sound quality
04:12 - but it wouldn't slow down anything that the CPU had to do a
04:17 - Network interface card could also go in an expansion slot. This would help your computer connect with the networks around it
04:24 - We'll talk about networks a little bit more in videos coming up now a PC card
04:29 - Which has really been turned mostly over to Express cards are found primarily in
04:34 - Laptops because of the size Express card is better. It's just much smaller
04:40 - In addition to expansion slots motherboards have ports now on your computer
04:45 - I'm sure you know, there's a place where you can plug in a USB cord
04:49 - firewire SD card
04:51 - Ethernet even an audio plug in so you can listen through headphones now
04:55 - These are all considered ports a place on the motherboard where you can connect the CPU
05:01 - To some outside source, either to get or give information
05:05 - So just a quick review of the motherboard at its very minimum connect the CPU and the memory
05:12 - But it also has expansion slots and ports
05:19 - And we're going to talk about the basics of software
05:22 - We've already covered hardware which are parts of the computer that you can actually see and feel with your hands
05:28 - Software are the programs that run on the hardware. You can't pick up a piece of software
05:33 - you can pick up a piece of hardware with the software downloaded onto it but
05:37 - Software is the code that is written and imprinted on to hardware
05:42 - The two main types of software that we're going to talk about are the operating system like Windows
05:47 - Mac or Linux. Those are the main three you're not really gonna get any more than that or
05:53 - applications now everything that you think of a software probably falls into these two
05:59 - spaces especially the applications
06:02 - Applications cover everything from your web browser to games to things like Photoshop or your mail how you edit documents
06:11 - every type of system application that is not an operating system is
06:16 - Just a regular software application
06:20 - the big takeaway from this video is that
06:22 - Hardware is what you can actually hold on to from a computer, but software
06:27 - Consists of all the programs that you can run on that hardware
06:34 - Now binary code is a really really basic simple computer language where there's just once and
06:41 - There zeros, there's by two things ones and zeros ones meaning on zeros meaning off
06:47 - So think of like a light switch which in some cases in super old computer
06:50 - There was an actual switch which was either on or off
06:53 - one thing on 0 being off so
06:56 - Bunch of ones and zeros, they can mean pretty much anything. But really they're mostly meant to be numbers and letters
07:02 - we're gonna go in a little bit on how you actually decode binary or translate a number to binary code but
07:09 - Really as you guessed you can usually just google binary translator and have that figured out the most important part of this
07:15 - Do you understand the concept that even?
07:18 - Basic things like zeros and ones can translate it
07:21 - But something really really complex and is the basis for all of the computer languages and programs that exist today
07:30 - We're gonna start by labeling starting backwards
07:34 - How many numbers there are this will be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 pretty straightforward
07:41 - so far
07:43 - The next step that we're going to do is take two to the power of whatever places so here
07:49 - It'll be 2 to the 0 2 to the 1 - 2 - 2 to the 3 you get the picture
07:56 - All right. Now that we got the 2 to the given power figured out
07:59 - All you gotta do is fill in some links and we'll have our solution 2 to the 0 is you got it
08:05 - 1 2 to the 1 is
08:08 - 2 2 to the 2 is
08:10 - 4 we've got 8 16 32 64 and that just keeps going on on
08:16 - Next what we're gonna do is see. Okay, which one of these numbers do we keep?
08:21 - alright, so the next step figure out which numbers do we keep do we just add up all the things together and if these were
08:27 - All ones then. Yes, we would but some of them are zeros
08:30 - The zero is the same thing as like an off switch one being on zero being off
08:36 - So we can go ahead and cross all of these out right here because they're they're not gonna really matter
08:40 - We want to keep this one this one here and here because they have the corresponding ones
08:46 - Which means yes, it's on we want to keep that number
08:49 - Basically from here on out. We're just gonna add these four numbers together getting us we've got 70 Tuesday for 75, so
08:57 - this number in binary means
09:00 - 75
09:06 - We're gonna be talking about data size the smallest size of data
09:10 - You can possibly have is called a bit now. That is I wrote a one here. That's an example of a bit
09:17 - It can really either only be a one or a zero
09:20 - It really goes back to that binary that we were talking about one me non
09:24 - Zero meaning off it can either be a one or zero that's a bit bigger than that
09:29 - We've got a nibble which is four bits. It's not very commonly used but it's adorable. I'm bigger than that
09:34 - We've got a bite now. This is common referring to something in a byte
09:38 - It is an eight bit put together
09:40 - now a lot of
09:41 - binary things are expressed with eight bits like letters and symbols and one most numbers really can be expressed that way until you get two
09:49 - really big ones so our most basic data sizes
09:52 - You got a bit and a byte but as you can guess it gets much bigger than that
09:57 - All right
09:57 - So after we get past the regular small bit and the first little byte which is eight bits
10:03 - We get bigger really fast. The next step up is a kilobyte which is
10:08 - 1,024 bytes which times eight is a whole lot more bits after the kilobyte. We've got megabyte which is
10:16 - 1,024 to power of two which is the same thing as
10:21 - 1,048,576 bytes
10:23 - so
10:24 - Since we're growing exponentially that is a big big increase after megabyte
10:29 - We've got gigabyte also known as GB which is 1,024 to the power of 3, then TB terabyte
10:36 - 1,024 to the power 4 and PD not peanut butter. It is henna byte
10:42 - 1024 to the power of 5 just to give you an idea of how big this number is if you can't see it
10:47 - I almost ran out of room writing this on my whiteboard
10:51 - These are some pretty big numbers. We're dealing with here
10:54 - You probably recognize megabyte gigabyte terabyte
10:58 - From regular storage that you've dealt with before on your iPad your iPod your computer or anything like that
11:06 - Alright just a quick review bit tiny little either 1 or 0 byte 8 bits
11:13 - kilobyte
11:15 - 1,024 bytes
11:16 - after that, everything is an exponent off of
11:20 - 1024 going from kilobyte to megabyte to gigabyte terabyte all the way up to the petabytes
11:28 - We're gonna be talking about data speed
11:31 - Davis, speed unlike data size is usually measured in bits per second
11:37 - Whereas size is measured in bytes
11:40 - Big difference being bytes is eight times bigger than bits at the very smallest level once we start talking
11:47 - Exponentially that makes a really big difference
11:51 - How we talk about speed kind of depends on what we're talking about when we talk about the speed of like an audio
11:57 - Download we talked about kilobits per second
12:01 - Kilobits not kilobytes totally different number today
12:05 - We're talking about an internet speed like the speed that your internet service provider gives you they usually measure that in megabits per second
12:12 - So 1 million bits per second. The network speed is something we talked about in gigabits per second
12:20 - So a billion bits per second biggest distinction here bits versus bytes
12:26 - Data speed is generally measured in bits
12:29 - Data size is measured in bytes
12:33 - Another thing we want to discuss just because they have an internet speed that says you get a certain amount of download
12:39 - That doesn't mean you're gonna be able to download that many bytes per minute per second. That's just not gonna happen
12:46 - They're talking about bits. It's gonna take you a little bit longer to do that since your data size is dealing with bytes
12:56 - We're going to be talking about the very most basic level the computers can understand other languages like JavaScript
13:03 - The most basic thing like we've already talked about is a bit up or down 1 or 0 on top of that
13:10 - We've got the biked 8 bit but together all
13:13 - Letters numbers and symbols can be broken down into bytes that the computer can understand at the most basic level
13:20 - So that means all of the letters and symbols that you're using in your JavaScript can be translated into byte now
13:27 - There are a lot of languages that the computer uses at the most basic levels to run just the operating system
13:33 - But what I want you to get away from this lesson, is that everything in your computer boils down to binary bytes?
13:43 - We're going to be talking about data networks
13:46 - You've heard of networks before maybe a wider network a road network even a television network or a cell phone network
13:53 - Today we're talking about data networks, which are the networks that computers use those three types
13:58 - we're going to cover in this video are the local area network the wide area network and the Virtual Private Network a
14:06 - Local area network is just a small group of computers that are connected together
14:11 - The most important thing about a local area network is that those computers are close together?
14:16 - so your Wi-Fi at Starbucks or at a school that is
14:20 - local area network that you can only connect to if you're actually close to that a
14:25 - Wide area network is two local area networks that have been connected over a long distance
14:31 - So maybe a school in Colorado wants to connect with the school in Missouri. They could use a wide area network
14:37 - You might think that those are connected over the internet and in the case of a virtual private network
14:43 - Which accomplishes basically the same thing as a wide area network it is
14:47 - VPNs use the Internet to connect there to local area networks
14:51 - However, a wide area network will usually rent a cable from an Internet company and connect that way
14:58 - So just to review a local area network is a group of computers connected
15:03 - Close to each other a wide area network in a virtual private network are two
15:08 - Local area networks or more than have been connected over long distances the wide area network
15:14 - Accomplishes this by renting a line from an Internet company and a virtual private network. Does it over the Internet?
15:25 - We're going to be talking about the internet part 1 how the internet works to know how the internet works
15:31 - We're going to talk first about IP addresses. You might be familiar with the fact that each of your devices has its own IP address
15:38 - Just like a house or apartment has its own actual address the internet can't deliver data to a device unless it has an IP address
15:46 - Not only does your device have an IP address
15:49 - But so does the modem and the router and every step along the way in the internet, which we'll get to later
15:55 - IP addresses are determined based on location
15:59 - starting in five big international
16:02 - Regions that's on this side as you get down the line each of these numbers brings you to a more specific location
16:09 - Now this number isn't specific enough that you could call 911 your IP address and they could find your house
16:15 - But it is specific enough where if you google find the best Ice Cream Sandwich near me
16:21 - Google can help you out there and actually give you something close to your location
16:25 - what I want you to take away from this video is that every device that connects to the Internet has an IP address and
16:31 - That it needs that IP address the information knows where to go
16:39 - Let's talk a little bit more about how the internet works
16:42 - We've already established that every device and every other thing along the way in the Internet has its own IP address
16:50 - Now these IP addresses are assigned based on location
16:54 - using these IP addresses
16:56 - Your device can talk to your modem
16:59 - Which you probably have in your home then to a router which is set up by your web service
17:04 - The router would go to the domain name server
17:06 - This is still just sending a request
17:08 - Now that domain name server would send back the information that was asked for and it would go right back to your device
17:15 - Now you might think this is pretty fallible
17:18 - If one of these steps goes out the whole process is done
17:20 - but
17:21 - Really?
17:22 - There's so many more connections with so many routers and so many servers is if one huge chunk of the internet goes out
17:29 - That still won't really affect the functionality of anything else. There are just intimate connections. It's amazing
17:37 - Now what I want you to take away from this video is that your device since it has its own IP address?
17:43 - can send out a request for information that
17:46 - Information is sent back to your device
17:49 - The way it gets to your device is because of the IP
17:51 - Address and the way it gets there is through all the lines of the modems and routers and servers that make up the Internet
18:01 - We are going to talk about something called a CDN and a content delivery network
18:07 - Now the concept of a CDN, isn't that hard to wrap your head around?
18:10 - What the CDN does is make a faster and smoother user experience by delivering content to the user faster
18:17 - It doesn't have to go through all the channels of the internet
18:19 - It creates a faster and more direct route from the site to the user
18:24 - When I first was learning about CD ends
18:26 - I got really confused because I thought well doesn't everybody benefit from that who's paying for the service?
18:32 - is that the user they'll pay for a CDN to make their internet faster or is that the website that pays a
18:39 - CDN to deliver their content and it's the latter a
18:43 - CDN is hired by a website or in some cases developed by a website. It's it's own CDN
18:49 - Then that CB n pays an internet service provider to help determine the fastest routes
18:55 - now what you need to know about CBN's in the big picture is
18:59 - They are hired by sites or created by sites to make the user experience
19:04 - faster an
19:06 - Example of a CDN that you should know about as a developer is how Google hosts languages like jQuery
19:13 - If you link to jQuery from Google's library instead of uploading it yourself to your site that's going to be way faster for your user
19:22 - Additionally if another site has used that same
19:25 - CDN for jQuery, it might be stored in that users browser. So it doesn't even have to load again all
19:32 - As a user you need to know that CD ends are everywhere
19:35 - You probably use CD ends all the time without really even needing to be aware as a developer
19:41 - It's important for things like the languages that are hosted on Google libraries
19:46 - you can use those in your sites and create a much faster user experience with less work on your end than before as a
19:53 - Big company, you might need to see the end to do something specifically for you
19:56 - You might want your site to be on the fast track to your users and you might need a CDN to do that
20:03 - All I want you to take away from this video is that CD ends are content delivery networks
20:09 - They are all over the place and they make a faster user experience
20:17 - We're gonna talk about analog versus digital on a really basic level most specifically we're going to talk about how computers
20:25 - interpret an analog sound and turned it into a digital file an
20:29 - Analogue sound wave would look something like this
20:31 - This would be like a perfect sine wave which would not really ever be heard of nature
20:35 - But that's beside the point this analog sound wave the computer takes that and measures at all these different points
20:43 - measures those and turns those into numbers based on this point right here so we could go up and say oh this is
20:49 - Point two seven says point one six and this is negative one point two
20:53 - Later, the computer could take those numbers and reinterpret them and turn them into actual sound again
20:59 - we're also going to discuss a little bit of data compression how
21:03 - Computers compress data that is the sound file and image file or a video file now
21:08 - The benefit of compression is that it's a smaller file
21:11 - So it's easier to store it takes up less space and it's easier to send to somebody else
21:15 - One of the ways this is done in sound is it would take it less often?
21:18 - The sampling would be every two or every three another way is that it would just go up to here and say, okay
21:25 - This is point two seven. Well, we're just gonna measure everything from here
21:28 - So it's negative three negative two negative one from there. If everything was around that same area in
21:34 - images this is done by taking the little tiniest possible pixels and just
21:38 - Measuring it in groups of sixteen and finding kind of the average color of that
21:42 - The most important thing to take away from this video is you're gonna want to use digital files
21:47 - They're gonna have a better quality
21:48 - And when you're looking at compression you really need to look at how far you're willing to go to ensure that the user still has
21:54 - the best experience
21:59 - We are gonna talk a little bit more about routers and how they relate to networking
22:04 - Routers are the things that connect different small area networks. I want to give kind of a metaphor for this
22:11 - So I'm a teacher I work at a school
22:13 - Let's say I have a package that I need to get to somebody that works in the district offices
22:17 - I don't know where her office is exactly, but I know her name I go to my secretary
22:22 - That would be this is me. This is my secretary I go to my secretary
22:26 - I say hey, I need to get this to so-and-so at the district office. Can you please help me out here?
22:31 - She'll say oh sure. I don't know exactly where her office is here, but I know how to get there
22:35 - I know the next step
22:36 - So even though I didn't know the next step she does so she goes on and sends it on to the secretary of the district
22:41 - Office now that district office secretary has no idea who I am or where I am
22:45 - But she knows the end location what I'm trying to get across here is each router
22:50 - Only has to know its own little network only the stops right next to it
22:55 - It doesn't have to know the whole internet just has to know its own connections and it can take information and say all right
23:02 - I don't know exactly where that's going. But I'll pass it on to the right direction
23:05 - And that's really all it takes
23:07 - Routers can be different sizes different capacities
23:10 - But what they do is just know their own neighborhood take the information and pass it on in the right direction
23:16 - another really powerful thing that we're going to get into a little bit later is
23:20 - They don't have to have the full package of information
23:22 - Either if this computer is trying to send information all the way up here
23:27 - It might get split up and go to two different routers and that's ok
23:30 - The computers are still going to know how to put that information back together correctly
23:35 - Now the little pieces of information that are sent are called packets
23:40 - Packets are actually little pieces of binary code, which I'm going to draw up here for you
23:45 - Alright, so this is an example of what a packet might look like
23:49 - It's just this line that goes up and then down and up and down and is either up or it's down
23:55 - That is an electrical current. So a computer gets back and can translate that into ones and zeros
24:00 - Which we all know is a binary code the way it does that is it drivelines a certain distance apart
24:05 - Basically and if it's up is the one if it's it's a zero as we discussed in previous videos
24:11 - This one and zero business can really mean a whole lot more fact. It means
24:16 - Everything everything can be translated into ones and zeros. So this is really powerful
24:21 - um, these little packets are sent across through these routers and
24:26 - Sometimes if there's a file that's too large for one packet
24:30 - It can be broken up into frames or smaller little packets. These packets don't have to go the same route
24:35 - They go whichever box available whichever stacks just and since they have the end IP address encoded into them
24:41 - All the routers know where to send them when they get to the end destination that computer knows how to put it all together

Hi, I'm Brianna from free code camp and today we're going to talk about the basics of computer hardware computers are made up of four basic parts the Input/output CPU and memory the input is what you're putting into the computer. Think about mouse keyboard Microphone. Anyway, you're giving data into the computer the output is what you're watching on your monitor or listening to on your speakers These can both be any format like text numbers Videos images what have you it doesn't matter the CPU stands for central processing unit And that's what we all think of when we think of a computer It's what does the functions it's what runs a software it manipulates the data The memory is where we store data and information now the CPU has exclusive access to this memory You can get to the memory from the input or from the output without the use of the CPU so just review we've got four basic parts of a computer the input/output CPU and memory In addition to those four basic parts, we have three more things we're going to discuss today the motherboard expansion cards and power supply The motherboard is what connects everything while the data is flying around over here trying to figure out where to go The motherboard helps route it so it goes to the right place Expansion cards are sound cards video cards that kind of thing that can really up your experience as a user Power supply is as it sounds what gets power to the computer It's usually a part of the computer that has that fan on it to keep it from overheating so let's do a quick review in addition to the four basic parts of Input/output central processing unit and memory, we usually have a motherboard expansion cards and a power supply We're going to talk about the different types of computers the biggest type of computer we're going to talk about is a supercomputer, which maybe you've heard of a Supercomputer uses a whole bunch of CPUs and uses something called Parallel processing all of those CPUs work on the same problem at the same time The next type we're going to talk about is a server a server holds and accesses a bunch of data or programs Our website free code camp is hosted on a server which stores all that information Next let's talk about a workstation computer now a workstation computer just looking at it might look similar to a personal computer But it has a bunch more power and is way more expensive Toy Story was built on workstation computers Now personal computers by far the most common type of computers Maybe you've heard I'm a Mac. I'm a PC something like they're different but really this map is still just a PC It's a it's a personal computer. It's still a book the Mac and a PC The last type of computer we're going to talk about is a microcontroller microcontroller that's the type of tiny computer you might have in your car that has a really Specialized task and is really good that one small thing but it's not like you could use it like a regular personal computer So just to review 5,000 computers supercomputer server workstation PC and microcontroller We're going to be talking a little bit more about the motherboard now the motherboard we mentioned briefly We're going to go into a little bit more detail today So what makes a motherboard is the connection between the CPU? And the memory if there's no connection between the central processing unit and the memory We can't call it a motherboard but most motherboards do a lot more than that primarily they have expansion slots and Ports now expansion slots are where you put anything that can increase the performance of the computer without putting more load on the CPU For example a graphics or a sound card would up your user experience by giving you a better video or better sound quality but it wouldn't slow down anything that the CPU had to do a Network interface card could also go in an expansion slot. This would help your computer connect with the networks around it We'll talk about networks a little bit more in videos coming up now a PC card Which has really been turned mostly over to Express cards are found primarily in Laptops because of the size Express card is better. It's just much smaller In addition to expansion slots motherboards have ports now on your computer I'm sure you know, there's a place where you can plug in a USB cord firewire SD card Ethernet even an audio plug in so you can listen through headphones now These are all considered ports a place on the motherboard where you can connect the CPU To some outside source, either to get or give information So just a quick review of the motherboard at its very minimum connect the CPU and the memory But it also has expansion slots and ports And we're going to talk about the basics of software We've already covered hardware which are parts of the computer that you can actually see and feel with your hands Software are the programs that run on the hardware. You can't pick up a piece of software you can pick up a piece of hardware with the software downloaded onto it but Software is the code that is written and imprinted on to hardware The two main types of software that we're going to talk about are the operating system like Windows Mac or Linux. Those are the main three you're not really gonna get any more than that or applications now everything that you think of a software probably falls into these two spaces especially the applications Applications cover everything from your web browser to games to things like Photoshop or your mail how you edit documents every type of system application that is not an operating system is Just a regular software application the big takeaway from this video is that Hardware is what you can actually hold on to from a computer, but software Consists of all the programs that you can run on that hardware Now binary code is a really really basic simple computer language where there's just once and There zeros, there's by two things ones and zeros ones meaning on zeros meaning off So think of like a light switch which in some cases in super old computer There was an actual switch which was either on or off one thing on 0 being off so Bunch of ones and zeros, they can mean pretty much anything. But really they're mostly meant to be numbers and letters we're gonna go in a little bit on how you actually decode binary or translate a number to binary code but Really as you guessed you can usually just google binary translator and have that figured out the most important part of this Do you understand the concept that even? Basic things like zeros and ones can translate it But something really really complex and is the basis for all of the computer languages and programs that exist today We're gonna start by labeling starting backwards How many numbers there are this will be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 pretty straightforward so far The next step that we're going to do is take two to the power of whatever places so here It'll be 2 to the 0 2 to the 1 2 2 to the 3 you get the picture All right. Now that we got the 2 to the given power figured out All you gotta do is fill in some links and we'll have our solution 2 to the 0 is you got it 1 2 to the 1 is 2 2 to the 2 is 4 we've got 8 16 32 64 and that just keeps going on on Next what we're gonna do is see. Okay, which one of these numbers do we keep? alright, so the next step figure out which numbers do we keep do we just add up all the things together and if these were All ones then. Yes, we would but some of them are zeros The zero is the same thing as like an off switch one being on zero being off So we can go ahead and cross all of these out right here because they're they're not gonna really matter We want to keep this one this one here and here because they have the corresponding ones Which means yes, it's on we want to keep that number Basically from here on out. We're just gonna add these four numbers together getting us we've got 70 Tuesday for 75, so this number in binary means 75 We're gonna be talking about data size the smallest size of data You can possibly have is called a bit now. That is I wrote a one here. That's an example of a bit It can really either only be a one or a zero It really goes back to that binary that we were talking about one me non Zero meaning off it can either be a one or zero that's a bit bigger than that We've got a nibble which is four bits. It's not very commonly used but it's adorable. I'm bigger than that We've got a bite now. This is common referring to something in a byte It is an eight bit put together now a lot of binary things are expressed with eight bits like letters and symbols and one most numbers really can be expressed that way until you get two really big ones so our most basic data sizes You got a bit and a byte but as you can guess it gets much bigger than that All right So after we get past the regular small bit and the first little byte which is eight bits We get bigger really fast. The next step up is a kilobyte which is 1,024 bytes which times eight is a whole lot more bits after the kilobyte. We've got megabyte which is 1,024 to power of two which is the same thing as 1,048,576 bytes so Since we're growing exponentially that is a big big increase after megabyte We've got gigabyte also known as GB which is 1,024 to the power of 3, then TB terabyte 1,024 to the power 4 and PD not peanut butter. It is henna byte 1024 to the power of 5 just to give you an idea of how big this number is if you can't see it I almost ran out of room writing this on my whiteboard These are some pretty big numbers. We're dealing with here You probably recognize megabyte gigabyte terabyte From regular storage that you've dealt with before on your iPad your iPod your computer or anything like that Alright just a quick review bit tiny little either 1 or 0 byte 8 bits kilobyte 1,024 bytes after that, everything is an exponent off of 1024 going from kilobyte to megabyte to gigabyte terabyte all the way up to the petabytes We're gonna be talking about data speed Davis, speed unlike data size is usually measured in bits per second Whereas size is measured in bytes Big difference being bytes is eight times bigger than bits at the very smallest level once we start talking Exponentially that makes a really big difference How we talk about speed kind of depends on what we're talking about when we talk about the speed of like an audio Download we talked about kilobits per second Kilobits not kilobytes totally different number today We're talking about an internet speed like the speed that your internet service provider gives you they usually measure that in megabits per second So 1 million bits per second. The network speed is something we talked about in gigabits per second So a billion bits per second biggest distinction here bits versus bytes Data speed is generally measured in bits Data size is measured in bytes Another thing we want to discuss just because they have an internet speed that says you get a certain amount of download That doesn't mean you're gonna be able to download that many bytes per minute per second. That's just not gonna happen They're talking about bits. It's gonna take you a little bit longer to do that since your data size is dealing with bytes We're going to be talking about the very most basic level the computers can understand other languages like JavaScript The most basic thing like we've already talked about is a bit up or down 1 or 0 on top of that We've got the biked 8 bit but together all Letters numbers and symbols can be broken down into bytes that the computer can understand at the most basic level So that means all of the letters and symbols that you're using in your JavaScript can be translated into byte now There are a lot of languages that the computer uses at the most basic levels to run just the operating system But what I want you to get away from this lesson, is that everything in your computer boils down to binary bytes? We're going to be talking about data networks You've heard of networks before maybe a wider network a road network even a television network or a cell phone network Today we're talking about data networks, which are the networks that computers use those three types we're going to cover in this video are the local area network the wide area network and the Virtual Private Network a Local area network is just a small group of computers that are connected together The most important thing about a local area network is that those computers are close together? so your WiFi at Starbucks or at a school that is local area network that you can only connect to if you're actually close to that a Wide area network is two local area networks that have been connected over a long distance So maybe a school in Colorado wants to connect with the school in Missouri. They could use a wide area network You might think that those are connected over the internet and in the case of a virtual private network Which accomplishes basically the same thing as a wide area network it is VPNs use the Internet to connect there to local area networks However, a wide area network will usually rent a cable from an Internet company and connect that way So just to review a local area network is a group of computers connected Close to each other a wide area network in a virtual private network are two Local area networks or more than have been connected over long distances the wide area network Accomplishes this by renting a line from an Internet company and a virtual private network. Does it over the Internet? We're going to be talking about the internet part 1 how the internet works to know how the internet works We're going to talk first about IP addresses. You might be familiar with the fact that each of your devices has its own IP address Just like a house or apartment has its own actual address the internet can't deliver data to a device unless it has an IP address Not only does your device have an IP address But so does the modem and the router and every step along the way in the internet, which we'll get to later IP addresses are determined based on location starting in five big international Regions that's on this side as you get down the line each of these numbers brings you to a more specific location Now this number isn't specific enough that you could call 911 your IP address and they could find your house But it is specific enough where if you google find the best Ice Cream Sandwich near me Google can help you out there and actually give you something close to your location what I want you to take away from this video is that every device that connects to the Internet has an IP address and That it needs that IP address the information knows where to go Let's talk a little bit more about how the internet works We've already established that every device and every other thing along the way in the Internet has its own IP address Now these IP addresses are assigned based on location using these IP addresses Your device can talk to your modem Which you probably have in your home then to a router which is set up by your web service The router would go to the domain name server This is still just sending a request Now that domain name server would send back the information that was asked for and it would go right back to your device Now you might think this is pretty fallible If one of these steps goes out the whole process is done but Really? There's so many more connections with so many routers and so many servers is if one huge chunk of the internet goes out That still won't really affect the functionality of anything else. There are just intimate connections. It's amazing Now what I want you to take away from this video is that your device since it has its own IP address? can send out a request for information that Information is sent back to your device The way it gets to your device is because of the IP Address and the way it gets there is through all the lines of the modems and routers and servers that make up the Internet We are going to talk about something called a CDN and a content delivery network Now the concept of a CDN, isn't that hard to wrap your head around? What the CDN does is make a faster and smoother user experience by delivering content to the user faster It doesn't have to go through all the channels of the internet It creates a faster and more direct route from the site to the user When I first was learning about CD ends I got really confused because I thought well doesn't everybody benefit from that who's paying for the service? is that the user they'll pay for a CDN to make their internet faster or is that the website that pays a CDN to deliver their content and it's the latter a CDN is hired by a website or in some cases developed by a website. It's it's own CDN Then that CB n pays an internet service provider to help determine the fastest routes now what you need to know about CBN's in the big picture is They are hired by sites or created by sites to make the user experience faster an Example of a CDN that you should know about as a developer is how Google hosts languages like jQuery If you link to jQuery from Google's library instead of uploading it yourself to your site that's going to be way faster for your user Additionally if another site has used that same CDN for jQuery, it might be stored in that users browser. So it doesn't even have to load again all As a user you need to know that CD ends are everywhere You probably use CD ends all the time without really even needing to be aware as a developer It's important for things like the languages that are hosted on Google libraries you can use those in your sites and create a much faster user experience with less work on your end than before as a Big company, you might need to see the end to do something specifically for you You might want your site to be on the fast track to your users and you might need a CDN to do that All I want you to take away from this video is that CD ends are content delivery networks They are all over the place and they make a faster user experience We're gonna talk about analog versus digital on a really basic level most specifically we're going to talk about how computers interpret an analog sound and turned it into a digital file an Analogue sound wave would look something like this This would be like a perfect sine wave which would not really ever be heard of nature But that's beside the point this analog sound wave the computer takes that and measures at all these different points measures those and turns those into numbers based on this point right here so we could go up and say oh this is Point two seven says point one six and this is negative one point two Later, the computer could take those numbers and reinterpret them and turn them into actual sound again we're also going to discuss a little bit of data compression how Computers compress data that is the sound file and image file or a video file now The benefit of compression is that it's a smaller file So it's easier to store it takes up less space and it's easier to send to somebody else One of the ways this is done in sound is it would take it less often? The sampling would be every two or every three another way is that it would just go up to here and say, okay This is point two seven. Well, we're just gonna measure everything from here So it's negative three negative two negative one from there. If everything was around that same area in images this is done by taking the little tiniest possible pixels and just Measuring it in groups of sixteen and finding kind of the average color of that The most important thing to take away from this video is you're gonna want to use digital files They're gonna have a better quality And when you're looking at compression you really need to look at how far you're willing to go to ensure that the user still has the best experience We are gonna talk a little bit more about routers and how they relate to networking Routers are the things that connect different small area networks. I want to give kind of a metaphor for this So I'm a teacher I work at a school Let's say I have a package that I need to get to somebody that works in the district offices I don't know where her office is exactly, but I know her name I go to my secretary That would be this is me. This is my secretary I go to my secretary I say hey, I need to get this to soandso at the district office. Can you please help me out here? She'll say oh sure. I don't know exactly where her office is here, but I know how to get there I know the next step So even though I didn't know the next step she does so she goes on and sends it on to the secretary of the district Office now that district office secretary has no idea who I am or where I am But she knows the end location what I'm trying to get across here is each router Only has to know its own little network only the stops right next to it It doesn't have to know the whole internet just has to know its own connections and it can take information and say all right I don't know exactly where that's going. But I'll pass it on to the right direction And that's really all it takes Routers can be different sizes different capacities But what they do is just know their own neighborhood take the information and pass it on in the right direction another really powerful thing that we're going to get into a little bit later is They don't have to have the full package of information Either if this computer is trying to send information all the way up here It might get split up and go to two different routers and that's ok The computers are still going to know how to put that information back together correctly Now the little pieces of information that are sent are called packets Packets are actually little pieces of binary code, which I'm going to draw up here for you Alright, so this is an example of what a packet might look like It's just this line that goes up and then down and up and down and is either up or it's down That is an electrical current. So a computer gets back and can translate that into ones and zeros Which we all know is a binary code the way it does that is it drivelines a certain distance apart Basically and if it's up is the one if it's it's a zero as we discussed in previous videos This one and zero business can really mean a whole lot more fact. It means Everything everything can be translated into ones and zeros. So this is really powerful um, these little packets are sent across through these routers and Sometimes if there's a file that's too large for one packet It can be broken up into frames or smaller little packets. These packets don't have to go the same route They go whichever box available whichever stacks just and since they have the end IP address encoded into them All the routers know where to send them when they get to the end destination that computer knows how to put it all together
