00:00 - um
00:01 - alex is going to introduce himself
00:02 - because he can do a much better job at
00:04 - it than i can so alex
00:07 - hi everybody
00:09 - hi hi
00:11 - hello
00:12 - um i will see you all in 150 slides so
00:16 - um can you see everything okay good my
00:17 - name is alex and some people let me do a
00:20 - talk here at pycon and so here i am um i
00:22 - used to do security instead of response
00:23 - atlassian but lately i've been doing uh
00:26 - red teaming which is like
00:28 - sponsored crimes and it's been really
00:30 - fun
00:31 - and today i'm going to talk to you about
00:32 - some things um also i also
00:35 - i've also agreed to like help organize
00:37 - this conference
00:38 - called purplecon and i've agreed to help
00:39 - organize it because i'm young and
00:41 - invincible
00:42 - uh recently no not recently a few years
00:44 - ago now um some uh i wrote about some
00:47 - like
00:48 - crimes that i did and
00:51 - some people some journalists wrote about
00:53 - that blog post and they said oh
00:54 - according to a blog post by a hacker who
00:56 - goes by the name alex
00:58 - and they put it in quotes and so alexis
01:00 - is my alex is my real name also and so
01:03 - so this is my this is my hacker name now
01:05 - um you can call me that i can't stop you
01:08 - i'm about to talk about i'm talking i'm
01:09 - about to talk about hacking my friend
01:11 - like a real friend like an actual friend
01:12 - of mine who's like a real person and not
01:14 - made up and so like in case any of you
01:17 - are having the genius idea that you
01:18 - should hack your friends um don't do
01:20 - that you it's not good it's not a good
01:23 - thing to do
01:25 - the only reason that's okay that i did
01:26 - it is because i explicitly asked them
01:28 - like d is it okay if i try and hack you
01:30 - do you understand what it means like are
01:32 - you sure you want to take the risks and
01:33 - so on and so on and this person said yes
01:35 - anyways this is my friend diana um
01:37 - dana's not her real name that's not a
01:38 - real picture this whole thing is like a
01:40 - lie um but it's what it's not a lie that
01:43 - she really did say it's okay for me to
01:44 - try and hack her and explain what all
01:45 - that is
01:47 - and so some things about her that you're
01:48 - gonna need to know is that she's a
01:49 - comedian that's her job and she's uh
01:52 - sweet and young and her like tech
01:54 - literacy is normal she like all of you
01:56 - people here at pycon probably know more
01:57 - about taking computers than she does she
02:00 - knows the normal amount for someone her
02:01 - age
02:02 - and so i like for some reason she said
02:04 - yes by the way she was like the first
02:05 - person i asked and i was like hey is it
02:07 - okay if i try and hack all your stuff
02:08 - and she was like yeah that was much
02:09 - easier than i thought it would be and so
02:11 - i made some rules about like okay well
02:13 - there's not just going to be no rules
02:14 - maybe so what what what constraints are
02:16 - we going to have and so i have 12 months
02:18 - to do it i can do any term in that 12
02:19 - months
02:20 - i'm not allowed to delete anything so
02:22 - i'll have to add stuff and look at stuff
02:23 - but
02:24 - i was like what if i deleted your emails
02:26 - and she was like oh that that would be
02:27 - bad okay you can't do that
02:29 - um and uh also i'm not allowed to
02:31 - disrupt her daily life so this means
02:32 - like if i were to lock her out of her
02:34 - email account by like changing the
02:36 - password then that would be bad because
02:38 - she needs her email account to like do
02:39 - things or if i was to like
02:41 - i don't know spam post stuff on her
02:42 - facebook wall then like that would be
02:44 - bad because she'd be like distracted by
02:46 - that i need to like not like interrupt
02:48 - her or inconvenience her because she's
02:49 - my real life real friend
02:51 - um also i decided that i'm just going to
02:53 - do this whole thing without getting
02:54 - caught because that's what not getting
02:56 - distracted sounds like anyway and also
02:58 - i'm not allowed to exploit the fact that
03:00 - i know her in real life so i know her
03:01 - like email address and phone number and
03:03 - where she lives and all this stuff i'm
03:05 - gonna not use that information i'm gonna
03:07 - do it as if i was a real hacker
03:09 - okay oh so that's right this talks for
03:11 - operation luigi's or the picture of
03:12 - luigi at the beginning you might be
03:14 - wondering why is this talk called
03:15 - operation
03:16 - luigi in the interest of timeless you
03:18 - can get straight to it the first thing
03:20 - we have to do is find out what her email
03:21 - address is even though we already know
03:22 - we have to find it and so i was like
03:24 - okay well i'm using this advanced
03:26 - hacking software um and i'm going to
03:28 - just uh put her name into it and the
03:29 - word linkedin and linkedin just tells me
03:31 - here's what her email address is because
03:33 - linkedin encourages you hey put your
03:34 - email address on linkedin so people can
03:36 - find you people like me um not really
03:39 - mostly recruiters but also people like
03:40 - me
03:41 - i notice it's a hotmail email address
03:42 - and i'm like oh maybe this is wrong
03:43 - maybe this is old because like no one's
03:46 - using hotmail still are they and so um
03:49 - but so then i went to her twitter
03:51 - i wanted to know whether this was her
03:52 - real email or her main email address i
03:54 - went to her twitter and if you try and
03:56 - reset your password on twitter it will
03:58 - say
03:58 - sure you can reset your password we're
04:00 - going to email a link to and then it
04:01 - will give you most of the email address
04:02 - it'll give you a few letters and the
04:04 - domain
04:05 - and i was like cool this means this is
04:07 - this means the hotmail one is a current
04:08 - email address weird people whether she's
04:11 - still using hotmail just but okay
04:13 - uh also this screenshot is old this
04:15 - doesn't happen anymore twitter doesn't
04:16 - let you do this anymore if you go and
04:18 - reset your password on twitter right now
04:19 - it'll be like sure you can reset your
04:21 - password type in the email address that
04:23 - you use to log into this twitter account
04:24 - tell us the email address and then we'll
04:25 - give you a link presumably to prevent
04:27 - this so good stuff twitter
04:29 - okay so now i have to get a phone number
04:31 - i think by the way i'm not this is my
04:32 - first time like hacking someone anything
04:35 - and so i'm like i don't really know what
04:36 - i'm doing but i've seen other people do
04:38 - it at conferences so i'm like i think i
04:39 - just need to collect everything that can
04:41 - be collected about this person first
04:42 - then somehow it'll somehow hacking will
04:45 - happen
04:45 - and so i'm like okay um here's okay i've
04:48 - got an email address and i'll put the
04:49 - word phone into my advanced hacking
04:51 - software i've actually obscured the name
04:52 - of the hacking software so you can't
04:54 - tell which one it is because it's so
04:55 - powerful
04:56 - um
04:57 - and
04:58 - so
04:59 - i do this and there's like a page and
05:01 - just says like hey do you want to sign
05:02 - up to this club because she's like the
05:03 - head of some sort of club and says
05:05 - contact anna at this email address this
05:06 - phone number because like she just put
05:08 - it on there online because she wanted to
05:09 - be found and so like this is not i'm not
05:11 - saying she's dumb or bad for doing this
05:13 - this is totally normal right you have to
05:14 - have some sort of privacy trade-off if
05:16 - you're going to like advertise yourself
05:18 - which is what you need to do if you're
05:19 - organizing a club or anything so like
05:22 - what can you do about that right if you
05:24 - want to organize a club you got to put
05:24 - some sort of contact information on the
05:26 - internet it works for me and so now i'm
05:28 - like okay what do i do i have the i have
05:30 - the email address and phone number what
05:32 - do i do now uh okay um
05:34 - um maybe i should i went to a lot of
05:36 - conferences and they say you have to
05:37 - email someone a word document with
05:39 - macros in it and then they click the
05:40 - macros and then you have control of the
05:41 - computer and i was like okay well i
05:43 - don't really know how to do that um
05:45 - also
05:46 - does she even have a laptop maybe she
05:47 - just has a phone
05:48 - also like if i got control of the
05:50 - computer then what would i do that would
05:51 - what would i i would probably just try
05:52 - and get her browser cookies and log into
05:54 - cloud stuff anyway so maybe i don't
05:56 - actually want control of the computer
05:56 - maybe i want her like
05:58 - say like email and passwords and stuff
06:00 - and so okay i'm not gonna do this this
06:01 - is too hard maybe i can just maybe i'll
06:03 - try and hack into email first and then i
06:05 - can decide what to do because her email
06:06 - is kind of like
06:08 - you know the the the
06:10 - keys to the kingdom sort of the top of
06:11 - everything if you can hack if you can
06:12 - get into someone's email then you can
06:14 - use the email to reset their twitter and
06:15 - reset their other stuff and get into all
06:17 - their other accounts so i'm going to try
06:18 - and go for that this is what this is
06:19 - what i justified this to myself it was
06:21 - late at night whatever
06:22 - um okay so now i have to get her email
06:24 - password note that i can't get into her
06:25 - email any other way
06:27 - i have to actually know her email
06:28 - password and type it in and log in at
06:30 - the same time as her because if i got
06:31 - into her email any other way by like
06:33 - pretending to be here and resetting it
06:34 - she will get kicked out of it so she has
06:36 - to also still be an email and also not
06:37 - know that i'm also in an email so the
06:39 - only way i can do this is by just
06:40 - getting the password which is what i'm
06:42 - trying to do
06:43 - um there's this great website for
06:44 - getting passwords um
06:46 - called have i been owned owned a lot of
06:48 - controversy on how to pronounce that
06:50 - and uh you left you uh put in an email
06:53 - address and it will tell you which of
06:54 - the like public data breaches they're
06:56 - called that email address appears in so
06:59 - you can put in your email and it will
07:00 - tell you yeah like linkedin got hacked
07:02 - in 2012 and your email was in there so
07:05 - some hacker has your linkedin password
07:06 - and it will tell you that for all the
07:07 - different sites that have been hacked
07:09 - that the all the different ones that
07:10 - this website knows about
07:12 - um clever nowhere does it say that you
07:14 - need to put in your email address so
07:15 - very cleverly i put in her email address
07:18 - and i find that she's at the time of
07:20 - writing
07:21 - um she was only in uh she was in a few
07:23 - the only interesting ones where patreon
07:24 - and tumblr patreon didn't have passwords
07:26 - tumblr was the only one that had
07:28 - passwords in the like data breach thing
07:30 - and so i was like okay cool i know my
07:31 - friend's like password is on the
07:33 - internet now i know it's on this it's in
07:34 - this tumblr thing um this is great so
07:38 - now uh the tumblr password dump is
07:40 - something that i just happen to have
07:42 - lying around and so it looks like this
07:45 - it's a big text file and it's just got
07:47 - the email address and then a column and
07:48 - the password hash and hackers are not
07:50 - very good at documenting their stuff and
07:51 - so they don't really say what kind of
07:53 - password hashes they are just a text
07:54 - file
07:55 - i looked around the internet and people
07:56 - seem to think that they're shy one
07:58 - hashes with a static salt and i'm like
07:59 - cool what does that mean and so
08:02 - let me explain what a static salt is
08:04 - um so imagine you're
08:06 - like i don't know a website let's call
08:07 - them tumblr
08:08 - and you're storing like emails and
08:10 - passwords uh this is one where you could
08:12 - do it you could store the email address
08:14 - of the person and you could also just
08:16 - store their password because then when
08:17 - they log in you know whether they typed
08:18 - in the right password because you have
08:19 - their password but then you go to a
08:21 - security conference and they tell you
08:22 - you're not allowed to do that so okay
08:24 - actually you need to hash the passwords
08:25 - so this way you don't store the password
08:27 - you store this like scrambled up version
08:29 - of it and then you can then you don't
08:30 - have to ch and you don't have to um keep
08:32 - a copy of the user's password but you
08:33 - can still check whether they type the
08:34 - right password in
08:35 - so okay now it's drawing password hashes
08:37 - and you're like am i doing it now and
08:38 - people at security conferences are like
08:40 - no this is not good enough you need to
08:42 - do the salting thing now and so now
08:44 - you need to before you hash before you
08:45 - hash the password you need to add a
08:47 - random string to the end of it just in
08:48 - case somebody has a big list of the hash
08:50 - of every possible like
08:51 - eight character string then they could
08:53 - possibly use that to like reverse what
08:55 - your hash was back into the password so
08:56 - you have to add this salt thing to the
08:58 - end and so you go okay okay and so now
09:00 - you're adding this salt and you add all
09:01 - the end of the password it's like this
09:03 - this is called a static sort and static
09:04 - means it's the same for all the
09:05 - passwords
09:07 - and so now you're adding the same thing
09:09 - to the end of every single password and
09:10 - the point of this is to prevent somebody
09:12 - with a big list of
09:14 - the hash of every single string from
09:16 - using that big list to reverse your
09:17 - password hashes
09:19 - but do you see the problem here the
09:21 - problem is that these two parts these
09:22 - two users have the same password and
09:24 - because we're adding the same thing to
09:26 - the end of the password the same the
09:28 - same static so the thing that's getting
09:30 - hashed is the same for both of these
09:31 - people in fact they're going to have the
09:32 - same password if and only if they have
09:34 - the same password hash and so even when
09:36 - we hash everything you can see these two
09:37 - these two users have the same password
09:39 - hash you don't know what it is you don't
09:40 - know what the password is but you know
09:41 - these two people have the same password
09:43 - because of the static salt thing
09:45 - uh so why am i telling you all about
09:46 - this static sold thing it's because i
09:48 - don't know what the soft is for the
09:50 - tumbler password dump even though it's
09:51 - the salt it's not meant to be a secret
09:52 - thing it's meant to be like public it's
09:53 - meant to be as public as like the
09:55 - usernames
09:56 - but i don't know what it is because it's
09:57 - not included in the text file because
09:58 - hackers are not good at documenting
10:00 - their stuff
10:01 - um so i'm like okay i really want to i
10:03 - really want to get my friends password
10:04 - out of this but i don't know how um so
10:08 - the first thing i did when i had the
10:09 - list was i searched for my friend's
10:10 - email address and i'm like okay if i
10:12 - grab for her email address i'll get all
10:14 - the lines that have her email address in
10:15 - it which is just the one with their
10:16 - password hash in it i'm like cool but i
10:18 - don't know what this don't know what
10:19 - this password hash goes to i don't know
10:21 - what password this password hash is of
10:24 - so here's the sneaky thing i do uh i
10:26 - search for her password hash in the file
10:28 - not her password just her password hash
10:30 - like an absolute madman because uh well
10:33 - what do you think will happen what do
10:34 - you think will happen when i type in her
10:36 - like when i grip for her password it
10:37 - should just be one like it should just
10:39 - be her line right should just have my
10:41 - friend dana's thing there's like 20
10:43 - people who have the the same
10:45 - have the same password hash right and
10:46 - these people it's like a little pathway
10:48 - book club right they can all get along
10:50 - and
10:51 - these these fun these fun little book
10:53 - enthusiasts all have the same password
10:54 - on tumblr and so this tells me a few
10:56 - things um probably it's not a very good
10:58 - password since all these people have
10:59 - thought of the same one but again i'm
11:02 - very smug but i don't know what it is so
11:03 - i need to find out what it is and so
11:05 - here's what i do i get
11:07 - just the email addresses of those people
11:09 - in the password book club i throw away
11:10 - the password hashes don't know what i
11:11 - don't know what to do with the hash just
11:12 - get those email addresses these are all
11:14 - the people who have the same password as
11:15 - diana and then conveniently did you know
11:17 - that linkedin was also hacked in 2012
11:19 - and uh dan dana was not in this list
11:22 - because she didn't have linkedin in 2012
11:23 - but lots of people were and thanks to
11:25 - the hard work and gpu cycles of people
11:27 - in the password cracking community
11:28 - almost all those linkedin passwords are
11:30 - in plain text now they're not just
11:31 - hashes their emails and like you know
11:33 - just passwords you can just look at with
11:34 - your eyes
11:36 - and i was like wow i also just happen to
11:38 - have that lying around and so
11:40 - then i did this thing where i looked up
11:42 - the same people who in the password book
11:44 - club in the tumblr list in the linkedin
11:46 - list
11:47 - and i found
11:48 - most of them not all about 80 of them
11:51 - had the same password as each other on
11:53 - linkedin as well so isn't that really
11:54 - sweet that book club transcends like
11:56 - services
11:57 - um
11:58 - and i thought it was sweet and uh i
12:01 - found that most of them had the password
12:03 - query one and so this is a bit of a
12:04 - there's a bit of like a bit of a jump
12:06 - here but i'm guessing that
12:08 - my friend dana has the same password as
12:10 - all these people on tumblr okay i'm not
12:11 - guessing that's definitely true and then
12:13 - i'm guessing that they'll have the same
12:14 - password on linkedin and then i'm
12:16 - guessing that that password is this most
12:18 - frequent one this quote query one thing
12:19 - i'm guessing that that's diana's
12:20 - password and i'm like okay i've done it
12:22 - let's go uh cordy wants down the
12:24 - password i did it i'm hacking let's go
12:26 - it's time to use this thing i got
12:27 - hotmail type in and it's not the right
12:29 - password like that's not a hotmail
12:30 - password it was that was it wasn't it
12:32 - and i was like well damn why did i do
12:35 - all this work
12:37 - why did i go to all these great lengths
12:38 - okay whatever um
12:40 - so then i go to facebook and so i don't
12:42 - just try it on her hotmail i tried on
12:43 - everything i go to facebook and uh it
12:46 - says oh no that's not your facebook
12:47 - password but it's an old password it was
12:50 - your password about five months ago
12:52 - i'm like oh thanks facebook for taunting
12:54 - me i guess i'm too late um
12:57 - but i mean like okay so this did used to
12:58 - be her password she just happens to have
13:00 - changed it recently and i've somehow
13:02 - stumbled upon a person it has more than
13:03 - one password in their life um so i'm
13:05 - like okay fine i guess it's the hard way
13:07 - um which is what i didn't want to have
13:08 - to do so by the way uh this this is what
13:11 - i had planned this is what i thought
13:12 - this like hacking would be like i was
13:14 - going to be like ah it's so easy to hack
13:16 - someone you just look them up and all
13:17 - these lists you have lying around and
13:18 - it's as easy as that and so the rest of
13:20 - this talk will be about how it's not as
13:21 - easy as that always
13:22 - and so i'm like okay i guess i'm going
13:23 - to try and do this fishing thing i'm
13:24 - going to try and trick her into sending
13:26 - me the password because everyone else is
13:27 - doing it it's more work it's way more
13:29 - it's more work because you have to make
13:30 - something custom but like oh well
13:32 - i don't know is this how you do fishing
13:33 - i don't know it's my first time maybe i
13:34 - should do something like this
13:43 - i don't know you don't know that you
13:44 - don't know that it won't work
13:46 - um so now i'm not going to do that i'm
13:47 - going to do this
13:48 - here's the plan i come up with i'm going
13:49 - to send her a fake email from microsoft
13:50 - because she has hotmail it has to be
13:51 - microsoft and that email is going to
13:53 - take her to a login screen for hotmail
13:54 - but it's a fake login screen that
13:56 - actually sends me a password and then
13:57 - she'll go to the real hotmail login
13:58 - screen and just kind of keep going as if
14:00 - nothing happened this is my plan i don't
14:01 - know don't whatever
14:03 - and so um but to do this i'm going to
14:05 - need to make a hotmail account to send
14:06 - the email from so i go to i go to make a
14:09 - hotmail account which will let me open a
14:11 - world of benefits and i try to make one
14:13 - that looks like microsoft i try to make
14:15 - a microsoft account team and says no you
14:17 - can't do that presumably because the
14:19 - word microsoft is in the email address
14:21 - and they know i'm not microsoft and so i
14:22 - try to make my first name microsoft and
14:24 - my last name account team and they're
14:25 - like no you can't do that
14:28 - and presumably to stop exactly what i'm
14:29 - trying to do and fair enough however
14:32 - these are my round friends and
14:34 - they're these look like two o's don't
14:36 - they looks like i put two o's in this
14:37 - slide like an absolute fool but actually
14:40 - one of them is an o and one of them is a
14:41 - greek letter omicron which looks a lot
14:43 - like an o to you and me doesn't it but
14:45 - to a computer they're completely
14:46 - different like unicode code points
14:48 - and so
14:49 - like if you just spell microsoft like
14:51 - this with these omicrons then like that
14:54 - doesn't say microsoft but like to you
14:56 - and me it looks like it does
14:58 - and so like does this really work i'm
15:00 - sure you're wondering like
15:04 - surely like
15:05 - surely the billions of dollars at
15:07 - microsoft and the most advanced mines
15:09 - aren't going to be full but no does work
15:10 - yeah it does
15:12 - and so i make this i make this microsoft
15:14 - account team thing and i send it this
15:15 - email which says like i copied this from
15:17 - like a real microsoft email that i got i
15:19 - copied all the like styling and most of
15:20 - the text and it says oh you better log
15:23 - into your account in the next 48 hours
15:24 - or we're gonna lock it um oh please do
15:27 - it or it's gonna be real bad this
15:29 - oh boy there's like russians ipad
15:32 - dresses you wouldn't want that i don't
15:33 - know
15:35 - um and so it says like come and log in
15:37 - please
15:38 - um but again this is just an email like
15:40 - that link that that don't lock his
15:42 - account thing at the bottom there has to
15:43 - be a link to something
15:44 - and so i need to make that i need to
15:46 - make a website for that bottom button to
15:47 - link to so okay let's go this is the
15:49 - real what my login screen it was at the
15:51 - time and so i'm gonna uh i need to make
15:54 - a copy of this and so there's another
15:55 - way to make a copy of things there's
15:56 - this hacking tools technique i learned
15:58 - about where stuff
15:59 - have you seen this before step one if
16:01 - you right click on something step two
16:02 - you hit this button
16:04 - and when you hit that inspect element
16:05 - button that's the good stuff
16:09 - i think there are easier ways to copy
16:10 - websites but i always do it this way
16:12 - anyway so here's my copy of the website
16:14 - it looks the same because it is the same
16:16 - um but this time it's on my computer
16:18 - it's on localhost and so now i need to
16:19 - put on the internet somehow um and so
16:22 - i'm like how do i put this i can't link
16:23 - her to localhost how do i put this
16:24 - online and i found this like
16:27 - static hosting company website thing
16:29 - they're not paying me to say this but
16:31 - they have like they let you like host
16:32 - static files on the internet and this is
16:34 - really good because you get a custom
16:35 - subdomain so you can be anything dot
16:36 - aerobatic.io and they give you https for
16:39 - free and it's like two commands or
16:40 - something to do it and no one knows
16:42 - about it so all the good subdomains
16:43 - aren't taken um so like i'm sure it's a
16:45 - good static hosting site but it happens
16:47 - to also be a really good phishing
16:48 - hosting site so um thank you to these
16:50 - people
16:52 - you can use the promo code diana to be
16:53 - immediately reported to the authorities
16:57 - uh this so this is the one i made this
16:58 - is the um the
17:01 - the domain i chose
17:02 - the real hotmail login screen is like
17:04 - the real hotmail login domain is
17:05 - login.live.com
17:07 - and so i could have like made my own
17:09 - domain name and like made it look even
17:10 - more similar but i just don't think
17:11 - diana's going to look at this at the the
17:14 - url very much because she's not like a
17:16 - paranoid security person like us so
17:19 - um but then again for some reason login
17:22 - when you go to like a login screen the
17:23 - url doesn't look like that it looks like
17:25 - this it has a bunch of like stuff at the
17:26 - end and so i just added a bunch of stuff
17:28 - at the end
17:32 - like it
17:33 - it doesn't do anything i actually stole
17:34 - it from the google login screen um
17:36 - but
17:38 - whatever okay it's my first time and so
17:40 - here it is this is my fake login screen
17:42 - on the internet now i know it's the same
17:44 - picture but this time on the internet
17:45 - trust me um and so i also add these
17:47 - bonus features to it um the first one is
17:49 - that after she clicks the the login
17:52 - button the submit button
17:54 - it's going to add an image to the page
17:55 - and the image goes to a website i
17:57 - control forward slash diana and then
17:59 - question mark and then plus whatever
18:00 - password is
18:02 - so the reason i'm doing this is to try
18:03 - and steal whatever just trying to steal
18:04 - a password this is like a terrible awful
18:06 - way to do it that you probably shouldn't
18:07 - do but it's really easy
18:09 - so like i'm going to get a request to my
18:11 - website forward slash diana and then
18:14 - plus some password i don't know what
18:15 - this password is so it's going to be a
18:17 - 404 but then in my logs it's going to be
18:19 - a request for a 404 to diana and then
18:21 - the password so i'm just going to be
18:22 - looking at my logs for this diana thing
18:23 - and when it shows up i'll be like ah
18:24 - that's the password
18:26 - and then i make it so that after she
18:27 - clicks the button it waits one second
18:29 - and then goes to the real hotmail login
18:30 - screen the one second way to simulate
18:32 - australian internet speeds
18:33 - [Laughter]
18:36 - anyway here's the email i send it's like
18:37 - you know look out it's something real
18:39 - bad's gonna happen and you only got 48
18:40 - hours because i'm creating time pressure
18:42 - and i'm doing all the good stuff i've
18:43 - seen random phishing emails do but i
18:45 - kind of just want this to work so come
18:46 - on click click the link and so i send it
18:49 - to her and search your anastasia 48
18:50 - hours and then 24 hours later nothing
18:52 - happens i'm looking at my logs and she's
18:54 - not there
18:54 - so i'm like she hasn't clicked on it yet
18:56 - and so i'm like oh okay uh so i sent the
18:58 - email again saying like same thing but
19:00 - now you only have 48 hours and now you
19:01 - only have 24 hours you better click it
19:03 - and then 48 hours later she also doesn't
19:06 - click on it and i'm like oh okay
19:09 - all right like at this point i'm not
19:11 - actually hacking anyone i'm just
19:12 - emailing my friend
19:14 - i'm like okay that's a shame i guess it
19:16 - wasn't interesting enough email and fair
19:17 - enough the thing i learned from this is
19:19 - that people don't really care about
19:21 - emails from microsoft or about like
19:23 - emails from like like automated emails i
19:24 - care about emails from people which
19:26 - leads me to the next way i try and do
19:28 - this
19:29 - which is like okay she's gonna be like
19:30 - on the internet whatever and she's gonna
19:32 - get an email from a recruiter and the
19:33 - recruiter is gonna
19:35 - link her to another fake to the same
19:36 - fake login page and then you're going to
19:38 - go to a google doc and the login page is
19:40 - going to make a login to see a google
19:41 - doc is that such but this is microsoft
19:43 - this is hotmail hotmail doesn't have
19:44 - google docs is there such thing as
19:45 - microsoft google docs and so i look it
19:47 - up is this is that a thing is that a
19:48 - real thing and there is and it's called
19:50 - cloud sky something something something
19:51 - something something
19:52 - and like
19:54 - and so i'm like great and so i log into
19:56 - this and make oh no i think i make the
19:58 - make the document in something else and
20:00 - then copy and paste it into this
20:02 - um and so now i have a microsoft google
20:03 - doc and you might be wondering what
20:05 - document i made i made a resume like i
20:07 - think like fake but convincing looking
20:08 - resume and then i send her oh no before
20:11 - i do that i have to make the person
20:12 - who's going to send it to her i can't
20:13 - email her for me can't email her from a
20:14 - microsoft account team so i guess it's
20:16 - going to have to be from this fake
20:18 - person
20:19 - and so i go to the google login screen
20:21 - you can put whatever you want in these
20:22 - boxes it's very good and so i make this
20:24 - person called kathleen wheeler who's
20:25 - like a mix of a first name and last name
20:27 - from a real company that i found
20:29 - and then i sent her this which says this
20:31 - is me writing this sometimes i sound
20:32 - like i'm a recruiter i don't really know
20:34 - what could it sound like and i'm saying
20:36 - hey i work at this comedy company which
20:38 - you care about um which i looked up
20:39 - earlier on linkedin and uh somebody has
20:42 - listed you as a reference somebody has
20:43 - told us that you work together like
20:45 - somebody has said that they worked with
20:46 - you
20:47 - uh here's the resume tell us how you
20:49 - know them blah blah blah click here for
20:50 - the resume that link is obviously the
20:51 - one that goes to the fake login screen
20:53 - and then after all this text being like
20:55 - can you fill out this form and tell us
20:56 - these things and blah blah blah that's
20:58 - just to distract from the link and then
20:59 - it says also can uh can you let me a
21:01 - good time to call you is the phone
21:03 - number her phone number which i found
21:04 - earlier okay the reason i put a phone
21:06 - number there so she knows this is like
21:07 - for her it's not like an accident like
21:08 - this person clearly knows who she is
21:11 - and then i made a sweet email signature
21:13 - at the bottom with like a different font
21:14 - and everything i thought it was really
21:15 - good attention to detail or whatever
21:17 - and so i sent this to her and it totally
21:19 - works like she clicks it she taps in a
21:21 - password like the whole thing just works
21:23 - flawlessly and i was like wow that was
21:24 - really easy and then i looked a little
21:26 - bit closer and i'm like wait a minute
21:28 - this password that she sent me that's
21:30 - that's corey one that's i already have
21:31 - that one like that's already that's i
21:34 - already
21:38 - i was like what that's
21:40 - how could that did i do something wrong
21:41 - and then i was like no wait a minute
21:42 - here's what i've learned she does not
21:44 - know how to help me out that's what it
21:45 - is
21:49 - which which which in many ways is the
21:51 - ultimate defense against people
21:55 - so like don't don't don't shame her for
21:57 - this but also because my fake login
21:59 - screen will just say yes no matter what
22:00 - password you type in and actually thinks
22:02 - this is a
22:03 - password
22:05 - yeah
22:06 - and i'm like whoops i hope i can fix
22:07 - that after this is all over anyway
22:10 - so i up instead of giving up i update my
22:12 - login screen so now no matter what you
22:13 - type in it just says wrong password the
22:15 - first three times
22:16 - because my theory is that people who
22:17 - like memorize all their passwords
22:19 - uh they just try one and if it doesn't
22:21 - work let's try the other one and the
22:22 - other one they just unload all their
22:23 - passwords into the form
22:25 - and so um i also change it so if you try
22:27 - a qwerty one the counter doesn't go up
22:28 - so you can't just type 21 three times
22:30 - and so then i send her out then she
22:32 - replies and she's like no i haven't
22:33 - worked with this person which is true
22:34 - because i don't exist uh and then she's
22:36 - like yeah you can call me that's the
22:38 - right phone number and i'm not going to
22:39 - call her because i'm not capitalizing
22:41 - out and then i'm like then i have a
22:43 - reply being like oops that was the wrong
22:45 - resume oh for some reason you better
22:46 - click on this this makes no sense right
22:49 - like like if you think about this like
22:51 - if you stop and think about this oh
22:52 - there's another person who also worked
22:53 - with you around the same time but with
22:55 - different dates today and i sent you
22:56 - their resume instead of the other that
22:57 - doesn't make any sense right like this
22:59 - story doesn't work but it has the same
23:01 - like bait of like somebody says they
23:03 - know you and you have to click to find
23:04 - out who
23:05 - and so i'm like you know pl please just
23:07 - click on it anyway please i know um and
23:10 - she does and this time same thing
23:12 - happens she clicks on it and she like
23:13 - types in a thing she types the same
23:14 - thing three times which is this other
23:16 - password which looks a lot like cody one
23:18 - um oh also none of these are real but
23:19 - they're similar to what they actually
23:20 - were um this one's like shifted along by
23:22 - one on the keyboard i'm like hmm okay
23:24 - what's this password and so i go to
23:26 - hotmail and like using my using the
23:28 - advanced hacking software google chrome
23:29 - type the password into the hotmail login
23:31 - screen and press enter and it totally
23:33 - works i get into email and i'm like it's
23:35 - as easy as that everybody
23:42 - see it's simple
23:44 - okay so i did i got an email password
23:45 - but now what do i do like
23:47 - i try the same password on everything
23:49 - and it doesn't work i'm like great this
23:50 - person has three passwords in their
23:52 - lives
23:53 - and then she replies being like no i
23:54 - haven't worked with this person either
23:55 - why are you doing this what what's
23:57 - happening and i reply just being like
23:59 - don't worry about it don't stress about
24:01 - it you know i'll just handle it
24:03 - please don't email me anymore please
24:05 - just forget about this
24:06 - and she does she doesn't reply so i'm
24:08 - like great
24:09 - meanwhile i log into email and i click
24:11 - on i want to search for more passwords
24:12 - so i can log into more stuff
24:15 - and so i like click on the search bar
24:17 - thing and it shows me her last five
24:18 - searches and i'm like oh but the last
24:20 - five searches aren't anything
24:21 - interesting
24:22 - um but i want to search for like
24:23 - password and other things but if i do it
24:25 - then she'll see there's in her search
24:26 - history right so uh
24:28 - i write down the last five things she
24:30 - searched for and then search for my
24:32 - stuff and then search for those things
24:33 - in reverse so
24:35 - so it looks exactly the same
24:37 - because it only shows the last five
24:39 - microsoft knows what i've done but i i'm
24:41 - doing it anyway um and it totally works
24:43 - but i didn't find any passwords because
24:45 - i don't know i found a lot of passwords
24:47 - i already had but i didn't find any new
24:48 - passwords and i was like fine whatever
24:51 - so this is the end of the talk i guess
24:52 - that's it i mean our email never believe
24:53 - it when it says the end question mark no
24:55 - it's obviously not the end geez um the
24:57 - stock is called operation let's talk is
24:58 - called operation luigi and i'm like
24:59 - already in my friend's email you know
25:01 - it'd be a real shame to just kind of
25:02 - leave it at that you know be real shame
25:04 - to not like do anything with that so
25:06 - here's what operation luigi is here's
25:08 - what we need to do first thing is get
25:09 - into her twitter second thing is to not
25:10 - lock her out of her twitter because she
25:11 - needs to be in there too and also don't
25:13 - let her know that i'm in her stuff don't
25:14 - know they don't have to know that i'm in
25:16 - her twitter um so here's how i do it i
25:18 - go to twitter and i'll be like hey i
25:19 - forgot my password until it lets me
25:21 - reset it and like you know because i'm
25:22 - in her email now and so i can reset the
25:24 - password because it'll send me the email
25:25 - and i can click it and i can do that now
25:27 - and so i changed her twitter password to
25:29 - qwerty1
25:30 - and so
25:34 - that's because this is the password that
25:35 - i think she thinks her password is
25:38 - and there's a little emails and blah
25:39 - blah blah wait for her to log in and
25:40 - because i need her to log in so i know
25:42 - that she's actually type 21 and she's
25:43 - back in her own account and i wait a
25:45 - while and then eventually she actually
25:46 - logs in and i'm like great it works she
25:48 - retweets she reshooted a picture of a
25:49 - dog and i was like yes
25:50 - okay so then i do the exact same thing
25:52 - with linkedin as i did with twitter and
25:54 - i try to change the linkedin password to
25:56 - kodi one as well but it doesn't let me
25:58 - presume because i got the qwerty one
26:00 - from the linkedin password jump so they
26:01 - know it's bad then there's a little box
26:03 - at the bottom which says require all
26:04 - devices to sign in with a new password
26:06 - which is like would you like to sign me
26:07 - out on like would you like to sign out
26:09 - all your other devices and i'm like
26:10 - absolutely not thank you linkedin for
26:12 - giving me this option it's unchecked by
26:14 - default so i can just change your
26:15 - password without even signing her out
26:16 - and so i just do that and then i log in
26:19 - and so okay now what let me explain so
26:21 - this picture of obama is here because i
26:22 - can't show you down as real pictures i
26:24 - have to show you uh because i can't show
26:26 - you how real profile pictures i'm going
26:27 - to show you what i did to her real
26:28 - profile pictures but with pictures of
26:29 - obama i don't know just go with it and
26:32 - so here's what her twitter picture was
26:33 - and i changed it to be like this i don't
26:35 - know if you can tell there's like
26:37 - it's like a low
26:38 - there's like a lightly transparent luigi
26:40 - there and so also she had a linkedin
26:42 - picture and i changed the linkedin
26:43 - picture to have like another luigi on it
26:45 - can you see it and so i just left it
26:47 - there for like i don't know weeks i
26:48 - don't know okay yeah good weeks i just
26:50 - left it there and no one said anything
26:51 - and i said okay i thought she might have
26:52 - noticed then but this is sort of like
26:54 - proof that i got somewhere and so you
26:56 - know nothing happened so i was like okay
26:58 - well was this over this was operational
27:00 - luigi because it's not over the
27:01 - remainder of this talk will be about
27:02 - operation waluigi
27:05 - and you know i came up with this like a
27:07 - long time ago back when this meme was
27:09 - like you know new anyway whatever
27:11 - waluigi let's go so i changed her link i
27:13 - changed her linkedin bio to be the
27:14 - entire wikipedia page for luigi
27:17 - and when i do this linkedin says her
27:19 - profile strength is advanced so thank
27:20 - you linkedin
27:23 - thank you linkedin for being there for
27:24 - me this entire talk
27:26 - anyway i changed her twitter to be this
27:27 - like
27:28 - i i want to make it super obvious so she
27:30 - i wanted to know that i'm there i want i
27:32 - want to be caught now like i'm trying to
27:33 - be caught i'm like hello notice me i'm
27:34 - very loud i tweet this from her account
27:37 - just go for it and she's online at the
27:39 - same time because it's like 7pm
27:41 - and she replies and she says omg to this
27:43 - thing and she says i've been hacked my
27:45 - dudes but then because i'm also logged
27:46 - in at the same time i reply as her
27:48 - saying oh no no
27:57 - it just seemed like the right thing to
27:58 - do at the time
27:59 - anyway then i tweet this then i create
28:00 - this and i keep doing things until she
28:02 - messages me and i treat longings for the
28:03 - days of this sweet lad and keep tweeting
28:05 - things and eventually she messages me
28:06 - and be like oh my gosh my twitter is
28:07 - this you and i'm like yes it's me don't
28:09 - worry nothing bad's happening i'll stop
28:11 - now it's all congratulations i guess you
28:12 - got me um and here's what happened after
28:15 - that um she loves her new waluigi life
28:17 - so much she goes and changes her
28:18 - facebook to be a waluigi themed even
28:20 - though i didn't even touch it
28:22 - um she listens to she's like gets really
28:23 - into luigi culture i'm not going to read
28:25 - this that like she like
28:30 - she like really got into it and she also
28:32 - asked me like wow how do i not get
28:33 - hacked like how do i what did i do wrong
28:34 - i'm like well you didn't do anything
28:35 - wrong
28:36 - but like this is kind of a question that
28:38 - people ask a lot right people ask
28:39 - security people like how do i stay safe
28:41 - what should i be doing online and these
28:42 - are just like regular people who ask
28:44 - this like not security people they're
28:45 - just like normal people they're not
28:47 - weird like us and they say oh how do i
28:49 - stay safe and sometimes the kind of
28:51 - answers they hear from security people
28:52 - are like oh you got to do all these
28:54 - things and live in a submarine and never
28:56 - go anywhere and you get to get all this
28:58 - advanced multi-factor ub keys
29:01 - or whatever
29:02 - and so like there are other things you
29:04 - can say you know
29:05 - so here's what i told her i was like
29:07 - well listen it's up to you right like
29:08 - there are things you can do to stay safe
29:10 - there are things you can do that they
29:11 - eat like there are things you can do to
29:13 - stay safe but they involve investing
29:14 - more time and effort it's up to you how
29:16 - much your investors up to you how much
29:17 - you care about this maybe you don't care
29:18 - and your finder is getting hacked that's
29:19 - okay that's a valid way to live your
29:21 - life
29:22 - um and so i help her set up two factor
29:23 - auth on her email because i'm about to
29:27 - do this blog post and publish a guide on
29:28 - how to hack her so i don't want it to be
29:30 - repeatable
29:31 - and so help her set up two factor
29:32 - authors so now she'll get a code on her
29:33 - phone which will be would have been way
29:34 - harder for me to get past because it's
29:36 - way harder to get past two factors you
29:37 - have to like i don't know fish the
29:39 - two-factor auth code or socially
29:40 - engineered the phone company too hard
29:42 - and so she was very happy that it wasn't
29:43 - that hard she was very happy that she
29:44 - could just do this and it wasn't like
29:46 - much extra effort for her because this
29:48 - is like the
29:49 - lowest effort highest security value
29:51 - thing i think that she could have done
29:53 - um and so she has a little app like this
29:54 - you know you know how to actually she
29:56 - has this little app and she's like yeah
29:57 - now i can just type in these codes
29:58 - um these backup codes are kind of a trap
30:00 - though and i kind of warned about only
30:02 - using the app because see that button
30:03 - that's like uh
30:05 - you know saved a text file or keep these
30:06 - codes somewhere safe no one clicks those
30:08 - buttons everyone's just like yeah
30:09 - whatever clothes like no one keeps these
30:10 - backup codes and so um that's why it's
30:13 - that's one of the reasons that's good
30:14 - type sms as a backup
30:16 - anyway in conclusion i just talked about
30:17 - luigi for like a long time so i hope you
30:19 - liked it and
30:21 - oh the last thing is you might be
30:22 - wondering like where did i get these
30:24 - before i was like oh i had these lying
30:25 - around probably wondering where did i
30:27 - get the like linkedin and tumblr like
30:28 - password hashes where did where do they
30:30 - actually come from
30:32 - thank you very much
30:41 - thank you
30:42 - hello
30:43 - thank you alex for uh that talk we have
30:45 - a lovely cup for you thank you
30:48 - um can melissa oh sorry alyssa come up
30:51 - to the stage awesome thanks

Cleaned transcript:

um alex is going to introduce himself because he can do a much better job at it than i can so alex hi everybody hi hi hello um i will see you all in 150 slides so um can you see everything okay good my name is alex and some people let me do a talk here at pycon and so here i am um i used to do security instead of response atlassian but lately i've been doing uh red teaming which is like sponsored crimes and it's been really fun and today i'm going to talk to you about some things um also i also i've also agreed to like help organize this conference called purplecon and i've agreed to help organize it because i'm young and invincible uh recently no not recently a few years ago now um some uh i wrote about some like crimes that i did and some people some journalists wrote about that blog post and they said oh according to a blog post by a hacker who goes by the name alex and they put it in quotes and so alexis is my alex is my real name also and so so this is my this is my hacker name now um you can call me that i can't stop you i'm about to talk about i'm talking i'm about to talk about hacking my friend like a real friend like an actual friend of mine who's like a real person and not made up and so like in case any of you are having the genius idea that you should hack your friends um don't do that you it's not good it's not a good thing to do the only reason that's okay that i did it is because i explicitly asked them like d is it okay if i try and hack you do you understand what it means like are you sure you want to take the risks and so on and so on and this person said yes anyways this is my friend diana um dana's not her real name that's not a real picture this whole thing is like a lie um but it's what it's not a lie that she really did say it's okay for me to try and hack her and explain what all that is and so some things about her that you're gonna need to know is that she's a comedian that's her job and she's uh sweet and young and her like tech literacy is normal she like all of you people here at pycon probably know more about taking computers than she does she knows the normal amount for someone her age and so i like for some reason she said yes by the way she was like the first person i asked and i was like hey is it okay if i try and hack all your stuff and she was like yeah that was much easier than i thought it would be and so i made some rules about like okay well there's not just going to be no rules maybe so what what what constraints are we going to have and so i have 12 months to do it i can do any term in that 12 months i'm not allowed to delete anything so i'll have to add stuff and look at stuff but i was like what if i deleted your emails and she was like oh that that would be bad okay you can't do that um and uh also i'm not allowed to disrupt her daily life so this means like if i were to lock her out of her email account by like changing the password then that would be bad because she needs her email account to like do things or if i was to like i don't know spam post stuff on her facebook wall then like that would be bad because she'd be like distracted by that i need to like not like interrupt her or inconvenience her because she's my real life real friend um also i decided that i'm just going to do this whole thing without getting caught because that's what not getting distracted sounds like anyway and also i'm not allowed to exploit the fact that i know her in real life so i know her like email address and phone number and where she lives and all this stuff i'm gonna not use that information i'm gonna do it as if i was a real hacker okay oh so that's right this talks for operation luigi's or the picture of luigi at the beginning you might be wondering why is this talk called operation luigi in the interest of timeless you can get straight to it the first thing we have to do is find out what her email address is even though we already know we have to find it and so i was like okay well i'm using this advanced hacking software um and i'm going to just uh put her name into it and the word linkedin and linkedin just tells me here's what her email address is because linkedin encourages you hey put your email address on linkedin so people can find you people like me um not really mostly recruiters but also people like me i notice it's a hotmail email address and i'm like oh maybe this is wrong maybe this is old because like no one's using hotmail still are they and so um but so then i went to her twitter i wanted to know whether this was her real email or her main email address i went to her twitter and if you try and reset your password on twitter it will say sure you can reset your password we're going to email a link to and then it will give you most of the email address it'll give you a few letters and the domain and i was like cool this means this is this means the hotmail one is a current email address weird people whether she's still using hotmail just but okay uh also this screenshot is old this doesn't happen anymore twitter doesn't let you do this anymore if you go and reset your password on twitter right now it'll be like sure you can reset your password type in the email address that you use to log into this twitter account tell us the email address and then we'll give you a link presumably to prevent this so good stuff twitter okay so now i have to get a phone number i think by the way i'm not this is my first time like hacking someone anything and so i'm like i don't really know what i'm doing but i've seen other people do it at conferences so i'm like i think i just need to collect everything that can be collected about this person first then somehow it'll somehow hacking will happen and so i'm like okay um here's okay i've got an email address and i'll put the word phone into my advanced hacking software i've actually obscured the name of the hacking software so you can't tell which one it is because it's so powerful um and so i do this and there's like a page and just says like hey do you want to sign up to this club because she's like the head of some sort of club and says contact anna at this email address this phone number because like she just put it on there online because she wanted to be found and so like this is not i'm not saying she's dumb or bad for doing this this is totally normal right you have to have some sort of privacy tradeoff if you're going to like advertise yourself which is what you need to do if you're organizing a club or anything so like what can you do about that right if you want to organize a club you got to put some sort of contact information on the internet it works for me and so now i'm like okay what do i do i have the i have the email address and phone number what do i do now uh okay um um maybe i should i went to a lot of conferences and they say you have to email someone a word document with macros in it and then they click the macros and then you have control of the computer and i was like okay well i don't really know how to do that um also does she even have a laptop maybe she just has a phone also like if i got control of the computer then what would i do that would what would i i would probably just try and get her browser cookies and log into cloud stuff anyway so maybe i don't actually want control of the computer maybe i want her like say like email and passwords and stuff and so okay i'm not gonna do this this is too hard maybe i can just maybe i'll try and hack into email first and then i can decide what to do because her email is kind of like you know the the the keys to the kingdom sort of the top of everything if you can hack if you can get into someone's email then you can use the email to reset their twitter and reset their other stuff and get into all their other accounts so i'm going to try and go for that this is what this is what i justified this to myself it was late at night whatever um okay so now i have to get her email password note that i can't get into her email any other way i have to actually know her email password and type it in and log in at the same time as her because if i got into her email any other way by like pretending to be here and resetting it she will get kicked out of it so she has to also still be an email and also not know that i'm also in an email so the only way i can do this is by just getting the password which is what i'm trying to do um there's this great website for getting passwords um called have i been owned owned a lot of controversy on how to pronounce that and uh you left you uh put in an email address and it will tell you which of the like public data breaches they're called that email address appears in so you can put in your email and it will tell you yeah like linkedin got hacked in 2012 and your email was in there so some hacker has your linkedin password and it will tell you that for all the different sites that have been hacked that the all the different ones that this website knows about um clever nowhere does it say that you need to put in your email address so very cleverly i put in her email address and i find that she's at the time of writing um she was only in uh she was in a few the only interesting ones where patreon and tumblr patreon didn't have passwords tumblr was the only one that had passwords in the like data breach thing and so i was like okay cool i know my friend's like password is on the internet now i know it's on this it's in this tumblr thing um this is great so now uh the tumblr password dump is something that i just happen to have lying around and so it looks like this it's a big text file and it's just got the email address and then a column and the password hash and hackers are not very good at documenting their stuff and so they don't really say what kind of password hashes they are just a text file i looked around the internet and people seem to think that they're shy one hashes with a static salt and i'm like cool what does that mean and so let me explain what a static salt is um so imagine you're like i don't know a website let's call them tumblr and you're storing like emails and passwords uh this is one where you could do it you could store the email address of the person and you could also just store their password because then when they log in you know whether they typed in the right password because you have their password but then you go to a security conference and they tell you you're not allowed to do that so okay actually you need to hash the passwords so this way you don't store the password you store this like scrambled up version of it and then you can then you don't have to ch and you don't have to um keep a copy of the user's password but you can still check whether they type the right password in so okay now it's drawing password hashes and you're like am i doing it now and people at security conferences are like no this is not good enough you need to do the salting thing now and so now you need to before you hash before you hash the password you need to add a random string to the end of it just in case somebody has a big list of the hash of every possible like eight character string then they could possibly use that to like reverse what your hash was back into the password so you have to add this salt thing to the end and so you go okay okay and so now you're adding this salt and you add all the end of the password it's like this this is called a static sort and static means it's the same for all the passwords and so now you're adding the same thing to the end of every single password and the point of this is to prevent somebody with a big list of the hash of every single string from using that big list to reverse your password hashes but do you see the problem here the problem is that these two parts these two users have the same password and because we're adding the same thing to the end of the password the same the same static so the thing that's getting hashed is the same for both of these people in fact they're going to have the same password if and only if they have the same password hash and so even when we hash everything you can see these two these two users have the same password hash you don't know what it is you don't know what the password is but you know these two people have the same password because of the static salt thing uh so why am i telling you all about this static sold thing it's because i don't know what the soft is for the tumbler password dump even though it's the salt it's not meant to be a secret thing it's meant to be like public it's meant to be as public as like the usernames but i don't know what it is because it's not included in the text file because hackers are not good at documenting their stuff um so i'm like okay i really want to i really want to get my friends password out of this but i don't know how um so the first thing i did when i had the list was i searched for my friend's email address and i'm like okay if i grab for her email address i'll get all the lines that have her email address in it which is just the one with their password hash in it i'm like cool but i don't know what this don't know what this password hash goes to i don't know what password this password hash is of so here's the sneaky thing i do uh i search for her password hash in the file not her password just her password hash like an absolute madman because uh well what do you think will happen what do you think will happen when i type in her like when i grip for her password it should just be one like it should just be her line right should just have my friend dana's thing there's like 20 people who have the the same have the same password hash right and these people it's like a little pathway book club right they can all get along and these these fun these fun little book enthusiasts all have the same password on tumblr and so this tells me a few things um probably it's not a very good password since all these people have thought of the same one but again i'm very smug but i don't know what it is so i need to find out what it is and so here's what i do i get just the email addresses of those people in the password book club i throw away the password hashes don't know what i don't know what to do with the hash just get those email addresses these are all the people who have the same password as diana and then conveniently did you know that linkedin was also hacked in 2012 and uh dan dana was not in this list because she didn't have linkedin in 2012 but lots of people were and thanks to the hard work and gpu cycles of people in the password cracking community almost all those linkedin passwords are in plain text now they're not just hashes their emails and like you know just passwords you can just look at with your eyes and i was like wow i also just happen to have that lying around and so then i did this thing where i looked up the same people who in the password book club in the tumblr list in the linkedin list and i found most of them not all about 80 of them had the same password as each other on linkedin as well so isn't that really sweet that book club transcends like services um and i thought it was sweet and uh i found that most of them had the password query one and so this is a bit of a there's a bit of like a bit of a jump here but i'm guessing that my friend dana has the same password as all these people on tumblr okay i'm not guessing that's definitely true and then i'm guessing that they'll have the same password on linkedin and then i'm guessing that that password is this most frequent one this quote query one thing i'm guessing that that's diana's password and i'm like okay i've done it let's go uh cordy wants down the password i did it i'm hacking let's go it's time to use this thing i got hotmail type in and it's not the right password like that's not a hotmail password it was that was it wasn't it and i was like well damn why did i do all this work why did i go to all these great lengths okay whatever um so then i go to facebook and so i don't just try it on her hotmail i tried on everything i go to facebook and uh it says oh no that's not your facebook password but it's an old password it was your password about five months ago i'm like oh thanks facebook for taunting me i guess i'm too late um but i mean like okay so this did used to be her password she just happens to have changed it recently and i've somehow stumbled upon a person it has more than one password in their life um so i'm like okay fine i guess it's the hard way um which is what i didn't want to have to do so by the way uh this this is what i had planned this is what i thought this like hacking would be like i was going to be like ah it's so easy to hack someone you just look them up and all these lists you have lying around and it's as easy as that and so the rest of this talk will be about how it's not as easy as that always and so i'm like okay i guess i'm going to try and do this fishing thing i'm going to try and trick her into sending me the password because everyone else is doing it it's more work it's way more it's more work because you have to make something custom but like oh well i don't know is this how you do fishing i don't know it's my first time maybe i should do something like this i don't know you don't know that you don't know that it won't work um so now i'm not going to do that i'm going to do this here's the plan i come up with i'm going to send her a fake email from microsoft because she has hotmail it has to be microsoft and that email is going to take her to a login screen for hotmail but it's a fake login screen that actually sends me a password and then she'll go to the real hotmail login screen and just kind of keep going as if nothing happened this is my plan i don't know don't whatever and so um but to do this i'm going to need to make a hotmail account to send the email from so i go to i go to make a hotmail account which will let me open a world of benefits and i try to make one that looks like microsoft i try to make a microsoft account team and says no you can't do that presumably because the word microsoft is in the email address and they know i'm not microsoft and so i try to make my first name microsoft and my last name account team and they're like no you can't do that and presumably to stop exactly what i'm trying to do and fair enough however these are my round friends and they're these look like two o's don't they looks like i put two o's in this slide like an absolute fool but actually one of them is an o and one of them is a greek letter omicron which looks a lot like an o to you and me doesn't it but to a computer they're completely different like unicode code points and so like if you just spell microsoft like this with these omicrons then like that doesn't say microsoft but like to you and me it looks like it does and so like does this really work i'm sure you're wondering like surely like surely the billions of dollars at microsoft and the most advanced mines aren't going to be full but no does work yeah it does and so i make this i make this microsoft account team thing and i send it this email which says like i copied this from like a real microsoft email that i got i copied all the like styling and most of the text and it says oh you better log into your account in the next 48 hours or we're gonna lock it um oh please do it or it's gonna be real bad this oh boy there's like russians ipad dresses you wouldn't want that i don't know um and so it says like come and log in please um but again this is just an email like that link that that don't lock his account thing at the bottom there has to be a link to something and so i need to make that i need to make a website for that bottom button to link to so okay let's go this is the real what my login screen it was at the time and so i'm gonna uh i need to make a copy of this and so there's another way to make a copy of things there's this hacking tools technique i learned about where stuff have you seen this before step one if you right click on something step two you hit this button and when you hit that inspect element button that's the good stuff i think there are easier ways to copy websites but i always do it this way anyway so here's my copy of the website it looks the same because it is the same um but this time it's on my computer it's on localhost and so now i need to put on the internet somehow um and so i'm like how do i put this i can't link her to localhost how do i put this online and i found this like static hosting company website thing they're not paying me to say this but they have like they let you like host static files on the internet and this is really good because you get a custom subdomain so you can be anything dot aerobatic.io and they give you https for free and it's like two commands or something to do it and no one knows about it so all the good subdomains aren't taken um so like i'm sure it's a good static hosting site but it happens to also be a really good phishing hosting site so um thank you to these people you can use the promo code diana to be immediately reported to the authorities uh this so this is the one i made this is the um the the domain i chose the real hotmail login screen is like the real hotmail login domain is login.live.com and so i could have like made my own domain name and like made it look even more similar but i just don't think diana's going to look at this at the the url very much because she's not like a paranoid security person like us so um but then again for some reason login when you go to like a login screen the url doesn't look like that it looks like this it has a bunch of like stuff at the end and so i just added a bunch of stuff at the end like it it doesn't do anything i actually stole it from the google login screen um but whatever okay it's my first time and so here it is this is my fake login screen on the internet now i know it's the same picture but this time on the internet trust me um and so i also add these bonus features to it um the first one is that after she clicks the the login button the submit button it's going to add an image to the page and the image goes to a website i control forward slash diana and then question mark and then plus whatever password is so the reason i'm doing this is to try and steal whatever just trying to steal a password this is like a terrible awful way to do it that you probably shouldn't do but it's really easy so like i'm going to get a request to my website forward slash diana and then plus some password i don't know what this password is so it's going to be a 404 but then in my logs it's going to be a request for a 404 to diana and then the password so i'm just going to be looking at my logs for this diana thing and when it shows up i'll be like ah that's the password and then i make it so that after she clicks the button it waits one second and then goes to the real hotmail login screen the one second way to simulate australian internet speeds [Laughter] anyway here's the email i send it's like you know look out it's something real bad's gonna happen and you only got 48 hours because i'm creating time pressure and i'm doing all the good stuff i've seen random phishing emails do but i kind of just want this to work so come on click click the link and so i send it to her and search your anastasia 48 hours and then 24 hours later nothing happens i'm looking at my logs and she's not there so i'm like she hasn't clicked on it yet and so i'm like oh okay uh so i sent the email again saying like same thing but now you only have 48 hours and now you only have 24 hours you better click it and then 48 hours later she also doesn't click on it and i'm like oh okay all right like at this point i'm not actually hacking anyone i'm just emailing my friend i'm like okay that's a shame i guess it wasn't interesting enough email and fair enough the thing i learned from this is that people don't really care about emails from microsoft or about like emails from like like automated emails i care about emails from people which leads me to the next way i try and do this which is like okay she's gonna be like on the internet whatever and she's gonna get an email from a recruiter and the recruiter is gonna link her to another fake to the same fake login page and then you're going to go to a google doc and the login page is going to make a login to see a google doc is that such but this is microsoft this is hotmail hotmail doesn't have google docs is there such thing as microsoft google docs and so i look it up is this is that a thing is that a real thing and there is and it's called cloud sky something something something something something and like and so i'm like great and so i log into this and make oh no i think i make the make the document in something else and then copy and paste it into this um and so now i have a microsoft google doc and you might be wondering what document i made i made a resume like i think like fake but convincing looking resume and then i send her oh no before i do that i have to make the person who's going to send it to her i can't email her for me can't email her from a microsoft account team so i guess it's going to have to be from this fake person and so i go to the google login screen you can put whatever you want in these boxes it's very good and so i make this person called kathleen wheeler who's like a mix of a first name and last name from a real company that i found and then i sent her this which says this is me writing this sometimes i sound like i'm a recruiter i don't really know what could it sound like and i'm saying hey i work at this comedy company which you care about um which i looked up earlier on linkedin and uh somebody has listed you as a reference somebody has told us that you work together like somebody has said that they worked with you uh here's the resume tell us how you know them blah blah blah click here for the resume that link is obviously the one that goes to the fake login screen and then after all this text being like can you fill out this form and tell us these things and blah blah blah that's just to distract from the link and then it says also can uh can you let me a good time to call you is the phone number her phone number which i found earlier okay the reason i put a phone number there so she knows this is like for her it's not like an accident like this person clearly knows who she is and then i made a sweet email signature at the bottom with like a different font and everything i thought it was really good attention to detail or whatever and so i sent this to her and it totally works like she clicks it she taps in a password like the whole thing just works flawlessly and i was like wow that was really easy and then i looked a little bit closer and i'm like wait a minute this password that she sent me that's that's corey one that's i already have that one like that's already that's i already i was like what that's how could that did i do something wrong and then i was like no wait a minute here's what i've learned she does not know how to help me out that's what it is which which which in many ways is the ultimate defense against people so like don't don't don't shame her for this but also because my fake login screen will just say yes no matter what password you type in and actually thinks this is a password yeah and i'm like whoops i hope i can fix that after this is all over anyway so i up instead of giving up i update my login screen so now no matter what you type in it just says wrong password the first three times because my theory is that people who like memorize all their passwords uh they just try one and if it doesn't work let's try the other one and the other one they just unload all their passwords into the form and so um i also change it so if you try a qwerty one the counter doesn't go up so you can't just type 21 three times and so then i send her out then she replies and she's like no i haven't worked with this person which is true because i don't exist uh and then she's like yeah you can call me that's the right phone number and i'm not going to call her because i'm not capitalizing out and then i'm like then i have a reply being like oops that was the wrong resume oh for some reason you better click on this this makes no sense right like like if you think about this like if you stop and think about this oh there's another person who also worked with you around the same time but with different dates today and i sent you their resume instead of the other that doesn't make any sense right like this story doesn't work but it has the same like bait of like somebody says they know you and you have to click to find out who and so i'm like you know pl please just click on it anyway please i know um and she does and this time same thing happens she clicks on it and she like types in a thing she types the same thing three times which is this other password which looks a lot like cody one um oh also none of these are real but they're similar to what they actually were um this one's like shifted along by one on the keyboard i'm like hmm okay what's this password and so i go to hotmail and like using my using the advanced hacking software google chrome type the password into the hotmail login screen and press enter and it totally works i get into email and i'm like it's as easy as that everybody see it's simple okay so i did i got an email password but now what do i do like i try the same password on everything and it doesn't work i'm like great this person has three passwords in their lives and then she replies being like no i haven't worked with this person either why are you doing this what what's happening and i reply just being like don't worry about it don't stress about it you know i'll just handle it please don't email me anymore please just forget about this and she does she doesn't reply so i'm like great meanwhile i log into email and i click on i want to search for more passwords so i can log into more stuff and so i like click on the search bar thing and it shows me her last five searches and i'm like oh but the last five searches aren't anything interesting um but i want to search for like password and other things but if i do it then she'll see there's in her search history right so uh i write down the last five things she searched for and then search for my stuff and then search for those things in reverse so so it looks exactly the same because it only shows the last five microsoft knows what i've done but i i'm doing it anyway um and it totally works but i didn't find any passwords because i don't know i found a lot of passwords i already had but i didn't find any new passwords and i was like fine whatever so this is the end of the talk i guess that's it i mean our email never believe it when it says the end question mark no it's obviously not the end geez um the stock is called operation let's talk is called operation luigi and i'm like already in my friend's email you know it'd be a real shame to just kind of leave it at that you know be real shame to not like do anything with that so here's what operation luigi is here's what we need to do first thing is get into her twitter second thing is to not lock her out of her twitter because she needs to be in there too and also don't let her know that i'm in her stuff don't know they don't have to know that i'm in her twitter um so here's how i do it i go to twitter and i'll be like hey i forgot my password until it lets me reset it and like you know because i'm in her email now and so i can reset the password because it'll send me the email and i can click it and i can do that now and so i changed her twitter password to qwerty1 and so that's because this is the password that i think she thinks her password is and there's a little emails and blah blah blah wait for her to log in and because i need her to log in so i know that she's actually type 21 and she's back in her own account and i wait a while and then eventually she actually logs in and i'm like great it works she retweets she reshooted a picture of a dog and i was like yes okay so then i do the exact same thing with linkedin as i did with twitter and i try to change the linkedin password to kodi one as well but it doesn't let me presume because i got the qwerty one from the linkedin password jump so they know it's bad then there's a little box at the bottom which says require all devices to sign in with a new password which is like would you like to sign me out on like would you like to sign out all your other devices and i'm like absolutely not thank you linkedin for giving me this option it's unchecked by default so i can just change your password without even signing her out and so i just do that and then i log in and so okay now what let me explain so this picture of obama is here because i can't show you down as real pictures i have to show you uh because i can't show you how real profile pictures i'm going to show you what i did to her real profile pictures but with pictures of obama i don't know just go with it and so here's what her twitter picture was and i changed it to be like this i don't know if you can tell there's like it's like a low there's like a lightly transparent luigi there and so also she had a linkedin picture and i changed the linkedin picture to have like another luigi on it can you see it and so i just left it there for like i don't know weeks i don't know okay yeah good weeks i just left it there and no one said anything and i said okay i thought she might have noticed then but this is sort of like proof that i got somewhere and so you know nothing happened so i was like okay well was this over this was operational luigi because it's not over the remainder of this talk will be about operation waluigi and you know i came up with this like a long time ago back when this meme was like you know new anyway whatever waluigi let's go so i changed her link i changed her linkedin bio to be the entire wikipedia page for luigi and when i do this linkedin says her profile strength is advanced so thank you linkedin thank you linkedin for being there for me this entire talk anyway i changed her twitter to be this like i i want to make it super obvious so she i wanted to know that i'm there i want i want to be caught now like i'm trying to be caught i'm like hello notice me i'm very loud i tweet this from her account just go for it and she's online at the same time because it's like 7pm and she replies and she says omg to this thing and she says i've been hacked my dudes but then because i'm also logged in at the same time i reply as her saying oh no no it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time anyway then i tweet this then i create this and i keep doing things until she messages me and i treat longings for the days of this sweet lad and keep tweeting things and eventually she messages me and be like oh my gosh my twitter is this you and i'm like yes it's me don't worry nothing bad's happening i'll stop now it's all congratulations i guess you got me um and here's what happened after that um she loves her new waluigi life so much she goes and changes her facebook to be a waluigi themed even though i didn't even touch it um she listens to she's like gets really into luigi culture i'm not going to read this that like she like she like really got into it and she also asked me like wow how do i not get hacked like how do i what did i do wrong i'm like well you didn't do anything wrong but like this is kind of a question that people ask a lot right people ask security people like how do i stay safe what should i be doing online and these are just like regular people who ask this like not security people they're just like normal people they're not weird like us and they say oh how do i stay safe and sometimes the kind of answers they hear from security people are like oh you got to do all these things and live in a submarine and never go anywhere and you get to get all this advanced multifactor ub keys or whatever and so like there are other things you can say you know so here's what i told her i was like well listen it's up to you right like there are things you can do to stay safe there are things you can do that they eat like there are things you can do to stay safe but they involve investing more time and effort it's up to you how much your investors up to you how much you care about this maybe you don't care and your finder is getting hacked that's okay that's a valid way to live your life um and so i help her set up two factor auth on her email because i'm about to do this blog post and publish a guide on how to hack her so i don't want it to be repeatable and so help her set up two factor authors so now she'll get a code on her phone which will be would have been way harder for me to get past because it's way harder to get past two factors you have to like i don't know fish the twofactor auth code or socially engineered the phone company too hard and so she was very happy that it wasn't that hard she was very happy that she could just do this and it wasn't like much extra effort for her because this is like the lowest effort highest security value thing i think that she could have done um and so she has a little app like this you know you know how to actually she has this little app and she's like yeah now i can just type in these codes um these backup codes are kind of a trap though and i kind of warned about only using the app because see that button that's like uh you know saved a text file or keep these codes somewhere safe no one clicks those buttons everyone's just like yeah whatever clothes like no one keeps these backup codes and so um that's why it's that's one of the reasons that's good type sms as a backup anyway in conclusion i just talked about luigi for like a long time so i hope you liked it and oh the last thing is you might be wondering like where did i get these before i was like oh i had these lying around probably wondering where did i get the like linkedin and tumblr like password hashes where did where do they actually come from thank you very much thank you hello thank you alex for uh that talk we have a lovely cup for you thank you um can melissa oh sorry alyssa come up to the stage awesome thanks
