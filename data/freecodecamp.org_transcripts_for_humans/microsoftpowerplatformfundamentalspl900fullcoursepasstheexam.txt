01:04 - [Music]
01:06 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
01:09 - and we're at the start of our journey
01:10 - asking the most important question first
01:12 - which is what is the Microsoft Power
01:14 - Platform fundamentals
01:16 - so the Microsoft Power Platform
01:18 - fundamentals is an entry-level Microsoft
01:20 - certification it has no prerequisites so
01:23 - you don't need to have any prior
01:24 - knowledge of the Power Platform
01:25 - components or the cloud to learn this
01:27 - specific course this course covers the
01:30 - following key topics understanding the
01:32 - business value of Power Platform and its
01:34 - components such as power apps power bi
01:36 - power automate and power virtual agents
01:39 - identifying the capabilities and
01:41 - limitations of each Power Platform
01:43 - component understanding the dataverse
01:45 - formerly common data service and how
01:47 - data connectors and external Services
01:49 - can be integrated creating basic canvas
01:52 - and model driven power apps creating and
01:55 - sharing power bi dashboards and reports
01:57 - creating automated workflows using power
02:00 - automate understanding the use cases of
02:02 - power virtual agents and knowledge of
02:05 - the basics of AI and the power platforms
02:07 - AI Builder capabilities
02:09 - so who is this certification for the
02:12 - certification is designed for
02:14 - individuals who are interested in
02:15 - learning how to Leverage The Power
02:16 - Platform to streamline business
02:18 - processes automate tasks and create
02:20 - custom Solutions you may consider this
02:23 - certification if you are new to Power
02:25 - Platform and want to learn the
02:27 - fundamentals and benefits of Power
02:28 - Platform in general you are a business
02:31 - user administrator developer data
02:33 - analyst or I.T professional you want to
02:35 - understand the capabilities of power
02:37 - platforms such as building basic
02:38 - business processes using power automate
02:41 - and power apps and gain skills and data
02:43 - analysis with power bi and creating chat
02:45 - Bots with power virtual agents or you
02:48 - are a senior Power Platform
02:49 - administrator or developer or in a
02:51 - related role who needs to reset or
02:53 - refresh their knowledge after working
02:54 - for multiple years
02:56 - so now let's take a look at the
02:58 - Microsoft Power Platform certification
03:00 - roadmap to see where we would go after
03:02 - the Power Platform fundamentals and what
03:04 - kind of roles would be associated with
03:06 - those certifications
03:08 - so at the start you get your Microsoft
03:10 - Power Platform fundamentals which is at
03:12 - the fundamental level after that we have
03:15 - the associate level certifications such
03:17 - as the Power Platform App Maker Power
03:19 - Platform functional consultant and Power
03:21 - Platform developer and we have an expert
03:23 - level certification called The Power
03:25 - Platform Solutions architect it's really
03:28 - up to you to choose which field you're
03:29 - interested in a common route could be
03:31 - something like if you're a developer and
03:34 - want to develop and secure Microsoft
03:35 - Power Platform Solutions you could take
03:38 - the Power Platform developer at the
03:39 - associate level and then move on to
03:41 - taking the Power Platform solution
03:43 - architect at the expert level if your
03:45 - interest lies more towards data analysis
03:47 - you could take the power bi data analyst
03:49 - to maximize the value of data assets
03:51 - with Advanced analytics and eventually
03:53 - take the Azure Enterprise data analyst
03:55 - to build Enterprise scale data analytics
03:57 - Solutions if you're an I.T professional
04:00 - or citizen developer you could take the
04:02 - Power Platform App Maker to simplify and
04:04 - automate tasks and processes then take
04:06 - the Power Platform functional console
04:08 - resultant to extend and customize
04:09 - Microsoft apps and services it's also
04:12 - common for people to take multiple of
04:14 - these associate level certifications it
04:16 - doesn't have to be just one this is to
04:18 - ensure they have a wide range of
04:19 - knowledge on all of these areas for
04:21 - possible career openings another route
04:23 - you can take is the Dynamics 365
04:26 - certifications which is a suite of
04:28 - enterprise resource planning and
04:29 - customer relationship management
04:30 - applications it specializes in helping
04:33 - businesses manage and streamline their
04:35 - financials operations sales marketing
04:37 - customer service and Human Resources
04:39 - procedures also if you have an interest
04:42 - in cloud computing you can explore
04:44 - options such as the Azure administrator
04:46 - and Azure developer from there you could
04:48 - take the Azure Solutions architect or
04:50 - devops engineer at the expert level so
04:53 - as you can see there are many possible
04:54 - paths to take and these are not all the
04:56 - ones available on the list ultimately
04:58 - it's up to you to decide what you want
05:00 - to specialize in keep in mind that there
05:02 - is no single perfect route these
05:04 - suggestions are simply intended to
05:06 - provide some guidance and help you make
05:07 - your own choice voice
05:09 - so how long is it going to take to pass
05:11 - this certification well it's going to
05:13 - really depend on your background but if
05:15 - we had to generalize it we can look at
05:17 - it as kind of a scale and so if you are
05:19 - at the beginner level you're looking at
05:20 - roughly 16 hours and when we say
05:23 - beginner we're saying someone that has
05:25 - never used Microsoft Power Platform
05:27 - products like power apps power automate
05:29 - power bi Etc someone that has never used
05:32 - Microsoft Azure or any cloud provider or
05:35 - someone that has no Tech background or
05:37 - experience and when we're looking at the
05:39 - other side of the Spectrum which is
05:40 - someone that is experienced we're
05:42 - looking at somebody who can watch this
05:43 - at 1.5 to 2 times speed and are able to
05:46 - absorb this information very quickly so
05:49 - they have practical working experience
05:50 - with the Power Platform products and is
05:52 - familiar with using them they have
05:54 - experience with Microsoft Azure or any
05:56 - cloud provider like Amazon web services
05:58 - or gcp so they can easily translate that
06:01 - knowledge or they have a strong
06:03 - background in technology where they've
06:05 - worked in the industry for many years
06:06 - and so you know their study time is
06:08 - going to be a lot shorter at seven hours
06:10 - or less and so on average most people
06:13 - are going to take about 12 hours to
06:15 - study for this course and when we talk
06:16 - about the kind of stuff you'll be doing
06:18 - it's going to be 50 lecture and labs and
06:21 - we call them follow-alongs where the
06:23 - idea is you follow along in your own
06:24 - account and that other fifty percent is
06:26 - the practice exams so if you look at the
06:29 - length of the content which is around
06:30 - three hours then you know you should
06:32 - spend as much time doing practice exams
06:34 - to pass and the recommended time to
06:36 - study is about one to two hours a day
06:37 - for roughly 10 days so what kind of
06:40 - effort are we going to have to put in to
06:42 - pass the exam well you have to watch the
06:44 - lecture videos and memorize key
06:46 - information you'll need to do Hands-On
06:48 - labs and follow along with your own
06:50 - account although as a fundamental
06:52 - certification the certification is not
06:54 - very heavy on Hands-On material but it
06:56 - will provide a much greater
06:57 - understanding of the topics you'll need
06:59 - to know for the exam and you will need
07:01 - paid online practice exams that simulate
07:03 - the real exam and the last two here were
07:06 - things that I used to never suggest
07:07 - because you could literally just watch
07:08 - the video shows and pass however
07:10 - Microsoft has recently updated this exam
07:13 - so it's a bit more difficult and so for
07:15 - these last two points you do have to do
07:17 - these two things for the paid online
07:19 - practice exams that can be hard for some
07:21 - people so I've made it easier for you by
07:23 - providing you with a full free practice
07:25 - exam on exampro.com
07:27 - pl-900 and so you just have to sign up
07:30 - with no credit card required and you'll
07:32 - get a full set of questions that
07:33 - simulate the real exam
07:35 - so for the contents of the exam the
07:38 - certification exam consists of six
07:40 - domains each with its own weightage that
07:42 - determines the number of questions from
07:43 - that domain that will appear so for
07:46 - domain one which is business value of
07:48 - Microsoft Power Platform we're looking
07:49 - at 20 to 25 percent for domain two
07:52 - identify foundational components of
07:55 - Microsoft Power Platform we should
07:56 - expect 10 to 15 percent of the questions
07:58 - from there for domain three the
08:01 - capabilities of power bi were sitting at
08:03 - around 10 to 15 percent of the questions
08:05 - for domain four the capabilities of
08:08 - power apps we have roughly 20 to 25
08:10 - percent of the questions for domain five
08:13 - capabilities of power automate it's
08:15 - about 15 to 20 percent of the questions
08:17 - and for domain six are the complementary
08:20 - Microsoft Power Platform Solutions which
08:22 - include power virtual agents and power
08:24 - Pages it's about 15 to 20 percent of the
08:27 - questions overall the exam is mostly
08:30 - well balanced and evenly distributed
08:31 - across all six domains so you won't be
08:34 - faced with an excessive amount of
08:35 - questions options from a particular
08:36 - domain that may not be your strong suit
08:39 - so where do you take the exam well you
08:42 - can take the exam at an in-person test
08:43 - center or online from the convenience of
08:45 - your own home
08:46 - Microsoft has partnered with the test
08:48 - center Network Pearson VUE and it offers
08:51 - in person or online and these exams are
08:53 - proctored meaning there is somebody
08:54 - watching you to ensure that you are not
08:56 - cheating
08:57 - in order to pass the exam you have to
08:59 - score 700 points out of the thousand and
09:01 - so 700 generally equates to 70 percent
09:03 - but it's around 70 percent because
09:05 - Microsoft uses scaled scoring this means
09:08 - that they could adjust it based on how
09:10 - many people are passing or failing so
09:12 - always aim to get higher than 70 percent
09:14 - the exam contains about 40 to 45
09:17 - questions so you can afford to get
09:19 - roughly 10 to 12 questions wrong there
09:22 - is no penalty for wrong questions such
09:23 - as minus one so you should always choose
09:25 - an answer and the questions come in a
09:27 - few formats multiple choice multiple
09:30 - answer drag and drop and yes or no
09:33 - questions
09:34 - the duration of the exam is one hour or
09:37 - 60 minutes so you have a little more
09:39 - than one minute per question the exam
09:41 - time is 60 minutes but the seat time is
09:43 - 90 minutes see time refers to the amount
09:46 - of time to review instructions show the
09:48 - online Proctor your workspace read and
09:50 - accept NDA and complete the exam and
09:52 - provide feedback
09:54 - and when you do pass the exam the exam
09:56 - is valid forever Microsoft's fundamental
09:58 - level exams do not expire and you do not
10:01 - need to do a recertification so that
10:03 - about covers the introduction of the
10:05 - course
10:06 - foreign
10:10 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
10:13 - and we'll be going through an exam guide
10:14 - breakdown of the Microsoft Power
10:16 - Platform fundamental certification so
10:19 - the first thing you want to do is to go
10:20 - to this link here
10:22 - learn.microsoft.com
10:24 - us slash certifications slash exams
10:28 - slash PL 900 and once you're here you
10:31 - want to navigate to this link called
10:32 - pl-900 study guide this will open an
10:35 - organized study guide that Microsoft has
10:37 - prepared for us for the Microsoft Power
10:39 - Platform fundamentals exam we've already
10:42 - covered a general overview on what the
10:44 - exam is who the exam is for and a brief
10:46 - overview on the topics but we'll need to
10:48 - cover the exam breakdown in a bit more
10:50 - detail this is the section we're looking
10:52 - for skills measured which have been
10:54 - updated recently as of making this
10:55 - course so we already covered the six
10:58 - main domains describe the business value
11:00 - of Microsoft Power Platform identify
11:03 - foundational components of Microsoft
11:04 - Power Platform demonstrate the
11:06 - capabilities of power bi demonstrate the
11:09 - capabilities of powerapps demonstrate
11:11 - the capabilities of power automate and
11:14 - describe complementary Microsoft Power
11:16 - Platform Solutions so I won't be going
11:18 - through each point on the entire list
11:20 - because it's quite long but I'll point
11:22 - out the ones that I think you should
11:23 - definitely pay attention to starting off
11:25 - with the business value of Microsoft
11:27 - Power Platform Services you'll
11:29 - definitely need to know all of these
11:30 - Services listed here and their value and
11:33 - benefits
11:34 - for the extending business solutions by
11:37 - using Microsoft powered platform you'll
11:39 - just need to know the general overview
11:40 - of these services like Dynamics 365 and
11:43 - Microsoft 365 apps but describing how
11:46 - Microsoft Power Platform apps work
11:48 - together would be the most important one
11:50 - for the Power Platform Administration
11:52 - and governance the most important one
11:54 - here is would be the Power Platform
11:55 - security model and environments for the
11:58 - Microsoft dataverse it's an important
12:00 - one to know things such as tables
12:02 - columns and relationships in Microsoft
12:04 - dataverse you will probably see business
12:06 - logic and data flows in Microsoft
12:08 - dataverse on the exam as well as the
12:10 - components of a connector
12:12 - for power bi the two important ones here
12:15 - are power bi desktop and power bi
12:17 - service and you'll need to know
12:18 - dashboards workspaces reports and
12:20 - paginated reports you'll also need to
12:23 - know how to build a basic dashboard by
12:25 - using power bi for power apps all the
12:28 - sections here you'll need to know well
12:29 - which are the differences between canvas
12:31 - apps and model driven apps and their use
12:33 - cases and capabilities for both you'll
12:36 - also need to know how to build a basic
12:37 - canvas and model driven app
12:39 - for the power automate section the most
12:42 - important ones would be cloud and
12:43 - desktop flow and how power automate
12:45 - cloudflows use connector triggers and
12:47 - actions actions for power automate
12:50 - desktop flows is another important one
12:52 - and you'll need to know how to build a
12:54 - basic power automate flow
12:57 - for the complementary Microsoft Power
12:59 - Platform Solutions you'll mostly just
13:01 - need a general overview of power virtual
13:03 - agents and the purpose of topics
13:05 - entities and actions you'll also need to
13:07 - know the use cases and capabilities of
13:09 - power pages and AI Builder once again
13:12 - there's a lot on the list so I couldn't
13:14 - mention all the points so I highlighted
13:16 - the ones I thought were the most
13:17 - important but throughout the course
13:19 - we'll definitely cover all of the
13:20 - material in great detail
13:23 - thank you foreign
13:27 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
13:29 - and I'll be giving you a walkthrough of
13:31 - our practice exam simulator so what
13:33 - we're looking at here is a free practice
13:35 - exam I provide for you all you have to
13:37 - do is sign up on exam Pro and you can
13:39 - redeem the free available content here
13:41 - you don't need a credit card at all
13:42 - these exam questions are up to date and
13:45 - closely simulates what you'll see on the
13:47 - exam you'll be getting a full set of 40
13:49 - questions so it's a real simulation like
13:51 - the actual exam so I'll be clicking in
13:54 - here to start the exam and I'll show you
13:55 - what it'll look like we won't be going
13:57 - through the entire exam we'll only be
13:59 - going through a couple of questions so
14:01 - you can get an idea of how the exam
14:03 - questions are structured and the level
14:04 - of difficulty these questions are so the
14:07 - first question we have presented with
14:09 - here is you are working for a company
14:10 - that uses Dynamics 365 sales to manage
14:13 - their sales processes as part of
14:15 - improving customer experience the
14:17 - company wants to implement a chat bot on
14:19 - their web page to interact with customer
14:21 - questions they want to use Microsoft
14:23 - Power Platform to extend the
14:25 - capabilities of Dynamics 360 five sales
14:27 - which application should you use to
14:30 - create a chat bot and extend the
14:31 - capabilities of Dynamics 365 sales so we
14:35 - have four options to pick from and in
14:37 - this scenario the best choice here
14:39 - should be powered virtual agents so
14:40 - we'll choose that
14:42 - so the next question we have here is you
14:45 - work for a busy eCommerce company that
14:47 - has experienced significant growth in
14:48 - Customer Support requests to enhance the
14:50 - support experience for both customers
14:52 - and support technicians the company
14:54 - wants to implement a tool that enables
14:56 - immediate notifications when new support
14:58 - requests are submitted which tools
15:00 - should you recommend to achieve this
15:01 - goal in this scenario the answer should
15:04 - be power automate
15:06 - so you'll mostly be seeing multiple
15:08 - choice and multiple select questions but
15:10 - there'll also be a few true or false and
15:12 - drag and drop questions in there as well
15:16 - here's a multiple select question where
15:18 - you have to select two choices to get
15:20 - the right answer in this scenario the
15:22 - first two options should be correct but
15:24 - I don't want to spoil too much for you
15:26 - let's end the exam here so you can see
15:28 - how well you performed and to review the
15:30 - questions
15:33 - here we can see that we only answer two
15:35 - questions correctly out of the 40.
15:38 - all the practice exam questions provide
15:41 - an explanation on why the answer was
15:42 - correct and also an explanation for the
15:44 - wrong answers
15:46 - they'll also be links to the sources and
15:48 - documentation so you can reference the
15:50 - material
15:51 - you won't need to perform any coding and
15:53 - they won't ask you anything about code
15:55 - in this exam
15:56 - the length of the questions can vary
15:58 - some questions are short and straight to
16:00 - the point and in some questions you'll
16:03 - be given a scenario and you'll have to
16:04 - figure out which tool is best suited for
16:06 - the requirement in these practice exams
16:08 - I added a bit more context to it so that
16:10 - you're over prepared so if you do really
16:13 - well on these practice exams you should
16:15 - do well on the actual exam
16:18 - [Music]
16:22 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
16:24 - and we'll be answering the most
16:25 - important question what is Microsoft
16:27 - Power Platform well Microsoft Power
16:30 - Platform is a line of business
16:31 - intelligence app development and app
16:33 - connectivity software applications
16:36 - Microsoft Power Platform is composed of
16:38 - five key products power apps power
16:41 - automate power bi Tower virtual agents
16:45 - and power pages
16:47 - we'll be going through a brief overview
16:49 - of each product starting off with power
16:51 - apps so powerapps provides a rapid low
16:54 - code development environment for
16:55 - building custom apps for business needs
16:57 - it has Services connectors and a
17:00 - scalable data service and app platform
17:02 - to allow simple integration and
17:03 - interaction with existing data some of
17:06 - powerapps features include creation of
17:08 - web and mobile applications easy user

35:25 - Bots and flows it can be used as a
35:27 - container to separate apps with
35:28 - different roles security requirements or
35:31 - Target audiences how environments are
35:33 - utilized will depend on the
35:34 - organization's needs and the apps being
35:36 - built for example you can build your
35:39 - apps or chat bots in a single
35:40 - environment you can group the test in
35:43 - production versions of your apps or chat
35:44 - bots in separate environments you can
35:47 - create environments for specific teams
35:49 - or departments in your company with
35:50 - relevant data and apps for each audience
35:52 - or you might also create separate
35:54 - environments for different Global
35:55 - branches of your company
35:58 - in Power Platform each environment is

36:18 - the apps you create in an environment
36:20 - can only connect to the data sources in
36:22 - that same environment including
36:23 - connections gateways flows and dataverse
36:26 - databases this means that an app created
36:28 - in what environment cannot connect to
36:30 - the data sources in another environment
36:32 - for example consider a scenario where
36:34 - you've created two environments named
36:36 - test and Dev and created a dataverse
36:38 - database in each of the environments
36:40 - if you create an app in the test
36:42 - environment it will only be permitted to
36:43 - connect to the test database it won't be
36:45 - able to connect to the dev database
36:49 - [Music]

37:18 - environment and set data loss prevention
37:20 - policies after creating the database in
37:23 - the environment you can use the system
37:24 - administrator role instead of the
37:26 - environment admin role the environment
37:28 - maker role can create resources such as
37:30 - apps connections custom connectors
37:32 - gateways and flows using power automate
37:35 - within an environment environment makers
37:37 - can share the apps they create with
37:39 - other users or groups within the
37:40 - organization however users or groups
37:43 - with these roles are not automatically
37:44 - granted access to the environment's
37:46 - database if one exists access to the
37:48 - database must be granted separately
37:51 - there are five main types of
37:53 - environments in Power Platform wide in
37:56 - production this is the default
37:57 - environment and it's where you deploy
37:58 - your finished apps and solutions that
38:00 - are ready for use by end users
38:02 - two sandbox this is a non-production
38:04 - environment that you can use to develop
38:06 - and test your apps and solutions without
38:08 - affecting the data in your production
38:09 - environment
38:11 - three trial this is a temporary
38:13 - environment that you can use to evaluate
38:15 - Power Platform before purchasing a
38:16 - license the trial environment is valid
38:19 - for 30 days
38:20 - for developer this is a non-production
38:22 - environment that is designed for
38:24 - developers to build and test their
38:26 - Solutions it provides full access to All
38:28 - Power Platform features and capabilities
38:30 - and five default this environment is
38:34 - automatically created for each tenant
38:35 - when it is provisioned it cannot be
38:37 - deleted but it can be renamed and its
38:39 - settings can be customized to meet your
38:40 - organization's needs

42:38 - [Music]
42:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
42:44 - and we'll be going through an overview
42:46 - of the dataverse Microsoft dataverse
42:48 - formerly known as common data service is
42:50 - a cloud-based solution that easily
42:52 - structures various types of data and
42:54 - business logic to support interconnected
42:56 - applications and processes in a secure
42:58 - and compliant manner it is a part of the
43:00 - Power Platform Suite of tools provided
43:02 - by Microsoft and is tightly integrated
43:04 - with other Power Platform products such
43:06 - as powerapps power automate and power bi
43:09 - dataverse allows users to store and
43:11 - manage data in a secure and scalable way
43:13 - with a flexible data model that can be
43:15 - customized to meet specific business
43:17 - needs it provides a set of tools for
43:19 - creating configuring and managing data
43:21 - entities fields and relationships and
43:24 - allows users to Define complex business
43:25 - logic using no code low code approaches
43:28 - such as formulas and workflows dataverse
43:31 - supports data integration with a wide
43:33 - range of external data sources including
43:35 - other cloud-based applications
43:36 - on-premises databases and various
43:38 - third-party services
43:40 - it also provides Advanced features such
43:42 - as data validation auditing and Version
43:45 - Control and can be used to build a
43:46 - variety of business applications such as
43:48 - CRM HR management and financial
43:51 - reporting among others
43:53 - here is an image that describes what's
43:55 - in the box of Microsoft dataverse
43:57 - breaking it down into categories such as
43:59 - security logic data storage integration
44:01 - and so on
44:03 - security dataverse handles
44:05 - authentication with Azure active
44:06 - directory to allow for conditional
44:08 - access and multi-factor authentication
44:10 - it supports authorization down to the
44:12 - row and column level and provides Rich
44:14 - auditing capabilities
44:16 - logic dataverse allows you to easily
44:18 - apply business logic at the data level
44:20 - regardless of how a user is interacting
44:22 - with the data the same rules apply these
44:25 - rules could be related to duplicate
44:26 - detection business rules workflows or
44:29 - more
44:30 - data dataverse offers you the control to
44:32 - shape your data allowing you to discover
44:34 - model validate and report on your data
44:36 - this control ensures your data looks the
44:38 - way you want regardless of how it is
44:40 - used
44:41 - storage dataverse stores your physical
44:43 - data in the Azure Cloud this cloud-based
44:45 - storage removes the burden of worrying
44:46 - about where your data lives or how it
44:48 - scales these concerns are all handled
44:50 - for you
44:51 - integration dataverse connects in
44:53 - different ways to support your business
44:55 - needs apis webhooks Eventing and data
44:58 - exports give you flexibility to get data
45:00 - in and out
45:02 - a dataverse database is a single
45:04 - instance of Microsoft dataverse which
45:06 - stores data in a set of standard and
45:08 - custom data structures called tables a
45:10 - table is a logical set of rows that is
45:12 - used to store data rows within a table
45:15 - contain many columns to manage
45:16 - individual pieces of information about a
45:18 - single row
45:19 - you can create one or many database
45:21 - instances in Microsoft dataverse to host
45:23 - data behind your business solutions each
45:26 - instance of a Microsoft dataverse will
45:28 - start with the same set of tables to
45:29 - store data but you can always extend and
45:31 - customize the Microsoft dataverse
45:33 - database to meet specific business needs
45:35 - scalability a dataverse database
45:38 - supports large data sets and complex
45:40 - data models tables can hold millions of
45:42 - items and you can extend the storage in
45:44 - each instance of a Microsoft dataverse
45:46 - database to four terabytes per instance
45:48 - the amount of data that is available in
45:50 - your instance of Microsoft dataverse is
45:52 - based upon the number and type of
45:54 - licenses that are associated with it
45:55 - data storage is pulled between all
45:57 - license users so you can allocate
45:59 - storage as needed for each solution that
46:01 - you build overall Microsoft data versus
46:04 - a powerful and flexible platform for
46:06 - managing and processing data with a wide
46:08 - range of applications across different
46:10 - Industries and business domains
46:13 - [Music]
46:16 - so a common question asked is what is
46:19 - the difference between traditional
46:20 - databases versus Microsoft dataverse
46:22 - well traditional databases and Microsoft
46:25 - dataverse have several differences in
46:27 - terms of their architecture
46:28 - functionality and usage here are some
46:31 - key differences while the architecture
46:33 - traditional databases are typically
46:35 - relational databases that store data in
46:37 - tables with defined relationships
46:39 - between them dataverse on the other hand
46:41 - is a note code low code platform that
46:43 - uses a data model to store data in an
46:45 - entity attribute value format to
46:48 - scalability traditional databases can be
46:50 - scaled up or down based on demand but
46:52 - this usually requires a dedicated team
46:54 - of database administrators to manage the
46:56 - hardware and software and contrast
46:59 - dataverse is a cloud-based platform that
47:01 - automatically scales to meet changing
47:02 - demands without requiring any manual
47:04 - intervention
47:06 - three integration traditional databases
47:08 - require custom integration code to
47:10 - connect with other systems whereas
47:12 - dataverse integrates seamlessly with
47:13 - other Microsoft products and services
47:15 - such as power apps power automate and
47:18 - Dynamics 365.
47:21 - for customization traditional databases
47:24 - can be customized using SQL queries and
47:26 - programming languages such as Java or
47:28 - python while dataverse provides a
47:30 - graphical interface that allows users to
47:32 - create custom entities fields and
47:34 - relationships without writing any code
47:36 - five security traditional databases
47:39 - typically require extensive
47:40 - configuration to secure data at various
47:42 - levels such as at the network server and
47:45 - database levels in contrast dataverse
47:47 - has built-in security features that
47:49 - provide granular Access Control to data
47:51 - at the entity and field levels in
47:54 - summary while traditional databases are
47:56 - suitable for large-scale
47:57 - mission-critical applications that
47:59 - require extensive customization and
48:00 - management data versus design for no
48:02 - code low code applications that require
48:04 - quick and easy development integration
48:06 - and management of data
48:09 - [Music]
48:13 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
48:15 - and we'll be covering tables and columns
48:17 - and dataverse a table is a logical
48:20 - structure containing rows and columns
48:22 - that represents a set of data here is a
48:24 - screenshot of the standard contact table
48:26 - in various types of columns it includes
48:29 - types of tables the three types of
48:31 - tables are standard tables also known as
48:34 - out of the box tables come pre-installed
48:36 - in a dataverse environment these include
48:38 - tables such as account business unit
48:40 - contact task and user most of these
48:43 - standard tables can be customized to
48:45 - suit specific needs additionally tables
48:48 - that are part of a managed solution and
48:49 - marked as customizable will also appear
48:51 - as standard tables users with the
48:54 - necessary permissions can modify these
48:55 - tables if the customizable property is
48:57 - set to True manage tables are those that
49:00 - cannot be customized and are imported
49:02 - into the environment as part of a
49:03 - managed solution
49:05 - custom tables meanwhile our managed
49:07 - tables that are either imported from an
49:09 - unmanaged solution or are created
49:10 - directly within the dataverse
49:12 - environment these tables can be fully
49:14 - customized by users with the appropriate
49:16 - privileges
49:18 - columns serve as a means of storing a
49:20 - specific piece of information within a
49:22 - table row much like an Excel column
49:23 - columns have data types meaning that you
49:26 - can store data of a certain type in a
49:27 - column that matches that data type
49:29 - for example dates are stored in columns
49:32 - with the date data type while numbers
49:33 - are stored in columns with the number
49:35 - data type
49:36 - the number of columns in a table can
49:38 - vary significantly ranging from a few to
49:40 - several hundred however having too many
49:43 - columns could indicate a need to
49:44 - reevaluate how data storage is
49:46 - structured for the solution
49:47 - in Microsoft dataverse a standard set of
49:50 - tables is provided by default and each
49:52 - of these tables has a predetermined set
49:53 - of columns
49:56 - [Music]
49:59 - the next topic will be covering are
50:02 - relationships and dataverse in Microsoft
50:04 - dataverse relationships Define the way
50:06 - that different tables in the system are
50:08 - connected or linked together based on
50:10 - shared data a relationship specifies how
50:12 - data in one table is related to data in
50:14 - another table
50:15 - relationships are defined by creating a
50:18 - field in the primary table that is used
50:19 - to store a reference to the related
50:21 - table this field is called a foreign key
50:23 - and it contains a value that matches the
50:25 - primary key of a record in the related
50:26 - table when data is entered or updated in
50:29 - the system the relationships ensure that
50:31 - related data is updated consistently
50:33 - across the tables which helps to
50:34 - maintain the Integrity of the data
50:36 - within the system relationships are an
50:38 - essential aspect of building complex
50:40 - data models and dataverse that can
50:42 - support a variety of business scenarios
50:44 - they allow users to connect and organize
50:46 - data in meaningful ways which can help
50:48 - to improve efficiency accuracy and
50:50 - insight into business operations
50:53 - there are three types of relationships
50:55 - in dataverse why one to many this is the
50:58 - most common relationship type in which
50:59 - one record in the primary table is
51:01 - associated with many records in the
51:02 - related table for example a customer
51:05 - could have multiple orders in the system
51:07 - to many to one in this relationship type
51:10 - many records in the primary table are
51:12 - associated with a single record in the
51:13 - related table for example many orders
51:16 - could be associated with a single
51:17 - customer
51:18 - three many to many this relationship
51:21 - type involves many records in both the
51:22 - primary and related tables being
51:24 - associated with many records in the
51:26 - other table for example a customer could
51:28 - have multiple orders and an order could
51:30 - involve multiple products
51:32 - foreign
51:36 - moving on to the next component of the
51:38 - data Versa environments environments are
51:41 - used to store manage and share your
51:43 - organization's business data apps and
51:45 - flows in Microsoft Power Platform for
51:47 - each environment created one Microsoft
51:49 - dataverse databases provisioned for use
51:51 - solely within that environment these
51:54 - environments also provide the ability to
51:56 - manage user access security settings and
51:58 - Associated Storage for the database and
52:01 - environment is created within a specific
52:03 - Microsoft Azure active directory tenant
52:05 - and its resources can only be accessed
52:07 - by users within that tenant in addition
52:10 - each environment is bound to a
52:11 - geographic location such as the United
52:13 - States upon creating a Microsoft
52:16 - dataverse database within an environment
52:18 - the database is created within the data
52:20 - centers located in the environment's
52:21 - geographic location
52:23 - furthermore any items generated within
52:25 - the environment including connections
52:27 - gateways power automate workflows and
52:30 - others are also bound to the
52:31 - environment's location
52:33 - by establishing multiple environments
52:35 - you can efficiently manage solution
52:37 - development and data storage for
52:39 - instance you may set up distinct
52:40 - environments for development testing and
52:43 - production use additionally environments
52:46 - can be created based on specific
52:47 - Geographic locations
52:49 - for example an environment for Europe
52:51 - and another for Asia may be established
52:53 - each of these environments is associated
52:56 - with zero or only one instance of
52:57 - Microsoft dataverse
53:00 - foreign
53:04 - the next topic we'll be covering are
53:06 - business rules Microsoft dataverse
53:08 - provides a feature to Define business
53:10 - rules which allow you to apply and
53:12 - maintain business logic at the data
53:13 - layer rather than the app layer this
53:16 - means that the business rules you create
53:17 - in dataverse are effective regardless of
53:19 - where you interact with the data
53:20 - business rules provide a powerful way to
53:23 - enforce rules validate data or set
53:25 - values regardless of the form used for
53:27 - data input they can increase data
53:29 - accuracy simplify application
53:30 - development and streamline forms for
53:33 - users
53:34 - both canvas and model driven apps can
53:36 - use business rules with actions such as
53:38 - set column values clear column values
53:41 - validate data and show error messages
53:43 - model driven apps can also use business
53:46 - rules to show or hide columns enable or
53:49 - disable Collins create business
53:51 - recommendations based on business
53:53 - intelligence
53:55 - here is an example of a simple yet
53:57 - powerful use of business rules the rule
54:00 - is set up to make the credit limit VP
54:01 - approver field mandatory when the credit
54:03 - limit exceeds one million dollars
54:05 - conversely the field is optional when
54:07 - the credit limit is below one million
54:09 - dollars by applying this business rule
54:11 - at the data level instead of the app
54:13 - level you have better control of your
54:14 - data this can ensure your business logic
54:17 - is followed whether it is being accessed
54:19 - directly from powerapps Power automate
54:21 - or via an API the rule is tied to the
54:24 - data not the app
54:25 - [Music]
54:29 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
54:32 - and the next topic we'll be covering are
54:33 - data flows and dataverse
54:35 - data flows in Microsoft dataverse are a
54:38 - way to extract transform and load data
54:40 - from various sources into dataverse
54:42 - tables with data flows you can automate
54:44 - the process of importing data from
54:45 - different sources and transform it into
54:47 - a consistent format this allows you to
54:49 - streamline the data integration process
54:51 - reduce data entry errors and improve
54:53 - data accuracy data flows are created
54:56 - using power query which is a data
54:58 - transformation in cleansing engine that
55:00 - enables you to transform data from a
55:02 - variety of sources such as Excel
55:04 - SharePoint SQL server and many others
55:07 - you can use power query to perform
55:08 - operations such as filtering sorting
55:11 - grouping and aggregating data and then
55:13 - load the transform data into dataverse
55:14 - tables
55:16 - data flows also support incremental
55:18 - refresh which means that only the change
55:20 - data is loaded into the dataverse table
55:22 - this helps to optimize data loading
55:24 - performance and reduces the amount of
55:25 - data that needs to be processed during
55:27 - the ETL process
55:29 - once the data flow is created and
55:31 - scheduled it runs on a regular basis
55:33 - such as daily or weekly depending on
55:35 - your needs
55:36 - the transform data is loaded into the
55:38 - specified dataverse table and you can
55:40 - then use it to power your apps reports
55:42 - and dashboards
55:45 - [Music]
55:48 - the next topic we'll be covering are
55:50 - data connectors Microsoft Power Platform
55:53 - is a system that enables users to create
55:55 - comprehensive business solutions by
55:57 - analyzing data through Power by Building
55:59 - Solutions using powerapps and automating
56:01 - business processes through Power
56:03 - automate data connectors allow Microsoft
56:06 - Power Platform to leverage data from
56:07 - different sources connectors act as an
56:10 - interface to connect to apis enabling
56:12 - the underlying services to communicate
56:14 - with Microsoft Power Platform popular
56:16 - connectors include Salesforce Office 365
56:20 - Twitter Dropbox SharePoint and SQL
56:22 - Server
56:24 - Microsoft Power Platform employs
56:26 - connectors to efficiently utilize data
56:28 - from multiple platforms connectors act
56:30 - as a link between your data source and
56:32 - your app or workflow allowing data to be
56:34 - exchanged between them by utilizing
56:36 - connectors you can expand your business
56:37 - solutions to various platforms and
56:39 - incorporate additional features for your
56:41 - users
56:42 - connectors allow apps to connect to apps
56:44 - data and devices in the cloud there are
56:47 - two types of data sources tabular and
56:49 - function based tabular data sources
56:52 - return data in a structured table format
56:54 - examples of tabular data sources include
56:57 - Microsoft dataverse SharePoint and SQL
57:00 - Server function-based data sources use
57:02 - functions to interact with data sources
57:04 - examples of function-based data sources
57:07 - include Office 365 users Azure blob
57:10 - storage and project online those types
57:13 - of data sources are commonly used to
57:14 - bring data across many platforms and add
57:16 - functionality to your Solution by
57:19 - connecting to these data sources Power
57:21 - Platform allows users to create powerful
57:23 - apps automate processes and analyze data
57:26 - from various systems and applications in
57:28 - one centralized location
57:30 - foreign
57:34 - now that you have gained some knowledge
57:36 - about data sources you are ready to
57:38 - learn about connectors connectors act as
57:40 - a link between your data source and app
57:42 - workflow or dashboard Microsoft Power
57:45 - Platform has over 600 connectors for
57:47 - various data sources that are
57:49 - categorized as standard and premium
57:51 - standard connectors are free and
57:53 - available to all users of Power Platform
57:55 - these connectors are developed and
57:56 - maintained by Microsoft and they allow
57:58 - users to connect to a variety of
58:00 - commonly used services and platforms
58:03 - some popular standard connectors or
58:05 - SharePoint Outlook and YouTube premium
58:07 - connectors require additional licensing
58:09 - for your app and or users freemium
58:11 - connectors are created and maintained by
58:13 - third-party vendors and offer more
58:15 - advanced capabilities they may have
58:17 - better performance more robust security
58:18 - features or provide additional
58:20 - functionality a few premium connectors
58:23 - or SQL Server SurveyMonkey and MailChimp
58:27 - connectors facilitate the exchange of
58:29 - data between the data source and Power
58:30 - Platform which can speed up the
58:32 - implementation of Microsoft Power
58:34 - Platform Business Solutions
58:36 - one example of this is using Dynamics
58:38 - 365 apps such as customer service where
58:41 - you can create a notification for users
58:43 - through Power automate when certain
58:45 - customer types are added you can use a
58:47 - SharePoint document library to store
58:49 - files that are then used in power apps
58:51 - for management and distribution
58:53 - Microsoft also offers connectors to
58:55 - their Azure Services which utilize
58:57 - Advanced AI techniques to perform tasks
58:59 - like extracting text from images or
59:00 - recognizing faces and images
59:02 - additionally all Microsoft Power
59:04 - Platform Business Solutions can be
59:06 - utilized in Microsoft 365 apps such as
59:09 - teams enabling users to run power
59:11 - automate from within teams
59:14 - [Music]
59:18 - although Microsoft Power Platform
59:20 - provides over 600 connectors users can
59:23 - choose to create a custom connector to
59:24 - expand their app's functionality by
59:26 - accessing either a publicly available
59:28 - API or a custom API they are hosting in
59:30 - a cloud provider like Azure API stands
59:33 - for application programming interface
59:35 - and it provides a set of functions that
59:37 - developers can use
59:38 - connectors work by exchanging data
59:40 - between apis and assembling functions
59:42 - into powerapps or power automate since
59:45 - these connectors are based on functions
59:47 - they will call specific functions in the
59:49 - underlying service of the API to return
59:51 - the corresponding data building custom
59:53 - connectors offers the benefit of
59:55 - cross-platform compatibility meaning
59:57 - they can be utilized in various
59:58 - platforms like power apps power automate
60:00 - and Azure logic apps
60:03 - creating custom connectors you can
60:06 - create custom connectors using three
60:07 - different approaches using a blank
60:10 - custom connector from an open API
60:12 - definition and from a postman collection
60:15 - custom connectors and Power Platform can
60:18 - be used in various use cases including
60:20 - why integrating with non-standard data
60:23 - sources custom connectors can be built
60:25 - to integrate with non-standard data
60:27 - sources that don't have pre-built
60:28 - connectors available this allows
60:30 - businesses to bring data from these
60:32 - sources into the Power Platform for use
60:33 - in apps and workflows
60:35 - to customize the existing connectors
60:38 - custom connectors can also be built to
60:40 - add functionality to existing connectors
60:42 - such as adding custom authentication or
60:44 - providing additional data transformation
60:46 - options
60:47 - three automating business processes
60:49 - custom connectors can be used to
60:51 - automate complex business processes that
60:53 - involve multiple systems and data
60:55 - sources this can help streamline
60:57 - workflows and improve efficiency
60:59 - for building apps for external users
61:01 - custom connectors can be used to build
61:03 - apps for external users such as
61:05 - customers or partners that require
61:07 - access to data from proprietary systems
61:09 - or databases
61:12 - [Music]
61:15 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
61:18 - and the next topic we'll be covering are
61:19 - triggers and actions triggers and
61:22 - actions are two fundamental components
61:24 - of the Power Platform once you have
61:26 - established a data source and configured
61:28 - your connector there are two types of
61:30 - operations you can use triggers or
61:31 - actions triggers initiate workflows when
61:34 - certain conditions are met for example a
61:37 - trigger can be set up to automatically
61:39 - start a workflow when a new item is
61:40 - added to a SharePoint list or when a new
61:42 - email arrives in a specific mailbox
61:44 - triggers can be set up in power automate
61:47 - formerly known as Microsoft flow and
61:49 - powerapps
61:51 - actions are prompted by the user or
61:53 - trigger and allow interaction with your
61:55 - data source through a specific function
61:56 - actions are used in power automate and
61:58 - power apps actions can be anything from
62:01 - sending an email or creating a new
62:03 - record in a database to posting a
62:05 - message in a chat application in power
62:07 - automate and power apps users can create
62:09 - custom actions by building flows which
62:12 - are workflows that automate repetitive
62:13 - tasks together triggers and actions
62:16 - allow users to create custom workflows
62:18 - that automate processes and improve
62:19 - productivity by connecting various
62:22 - services and applications users can
62:24 - streamline workflows reduce errors and
62:26 - save time Power Platform provides a wide
62:29 - range of connectors and templates that
62:31 - can be used to create these workflows
62:32 - and users can also create custom
62:34 - connectors and actions to suit their
62:36 - specific needs
62:38 - foreign
62:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
62:44 - and in this section we'll be going into
62:46 - greater detail of what power bi is at
62:48 - its main components let's begin with a
62:50 - brief overview Microsoft power bi is a
62:53 - collection of software Services
62:54 - applications and connectors that work
62:56 - together to transform your diverse data
62:58 - sources into coherent engaging visuals
63:00 - and interactive insights power bi
63:03 - enables you to connect to your data
63:04 - sources clean and model your data
63:06 - without affecting the underlying Source
63:08 - visualize and share what's important
63:10 - with anyone you choose your data could
63:12 - be a simple Microsoft Excel workbook a
63:14 - collection of cloud-based and
63:16 - on-premises hybrid data warehouses and
63:18 - many more as you can see from the image
63:20 - you can use many data sources such as
63:22 - Excel Cloud databases Microsoft Edge
63:25 - Microsoft Access SQL databases and many
63:28 - more you can use them with power bi and
63:30 - generate all kinds of visualizations
63:32 - reports dashboards Etc that will help
63:34 - you find business insights within your
63:36 - organization's data
63:38 - thank you
63:42 - the next topic we'll be discussing about
63:44 - are the parts of power bi so power bi is
63:47 - made up of several components that all
63:49 - function together starting with these
63:50 - three fundamentals first we have a
63:52 - Windows desktop application called Power
63:54 - bi desktop secondly we have an online
63:57 - SAS service called the power bi service
63:59 - and lastly we have power bi mobile apps
64:01 - for Windows IOS and Android devices
64:04 - power bi desktop power bi service and
64:07 - power bi mobile apps are designed to let
64:08 - you create share and consume business
64:10 - insights in the way that serves you and
64:12 - your role most effectively
64:14 - now let's go over the power bi Concepts
64:16 - data sets reports and dashboards are the
64:19 - three main components of power bi they
64:22 - are all organized into workspaces and
64:23 - they are created on capacities so what
64:26 - are capacities capacities or a Core
64:28 - Power bi concept that refer to a set of
64:30 - resources utilized to host and deliver
64:32 - your power bi work capacities are either
64:34 - shared or dedicated by share capacity is
64:37 - shared with other Microsoft customers
64:39 - while a dedicated capacity is fully
64:41 - committed to a single customer dedicated
64:43 - capacities require a subscription by
64:46 - default workspaces are created on a
64:48 - shared capacity so that's all for the
64:50 - main components of power bi
64:52 - [Music]
64:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
64:59 - and we'll be going over what workspaces
65:00 - in power bir so workspaces are
65:03 - containers for dashboards reports data
65:05 - sets and data flows in power bi there
65:08 - are two types of workspaces first we
65:10 - have my workspace and then we have
65:12 - workspaces so my workspace is the
65:15 - personal workspace for any power bi
65:16 - customer to work with your own content
65:18 - only you have access to your my
65:20 - workspace
65:21 - you can share dashboards and reports
65:23 - from your my workspace if you want to
65:26 - collaborate on dashboards and reports or
65:28 - create an app then you want to work in a
65:30 - workspace
65:31 - workspaces are used to collaborate and
65:33 - share content with colleagues you can
65:35 - add colleagues to your workspaces and
65:37 - collaborate on dashboards reports and
65:39 - data sets keep in mind that all
65:41 - workspace members need power bi Pro
65:43 - licenses workspaces are also the places
65:45 - where you create publish and manage apps
65:48 - for your organization workspaces can be
65:50 - thought of as staging areas and
65:52 - containers for the content that will
65:53 - make up a power bi app an app is a
65:55 - collection of dashboards and reports
65:57 - created to provide important metrics to
65:59 - the power bi consumers in your company
66:01 - apps are interactive but consumers
66:03 - cannot edit them app consumers and the
66:05 - colleagues who have access to the apps
66:07 - do not necessarily need Pro licenses so
66:10 - that's a general overview of workspaces
66:12 - in power bi
66:13 - foreign
66:17 - the next topic we'll be covering are
66:19 - data sets in power bi so a data set is a
66:23 - collection of data that you import or
66:24 - connect to Tower bi enables you to
66:26 - connect to import and combine many data
66:29 - sets in one location data sets can
66:31 - Source data from data flows data sets
66:33 - are associated with workspaces in a
66:35 - single data set can be part of many
66:37 - workspaces when you open a workspace the
66:39 - associated data sets are listed under
66:41 - the data sets tab each listed data set
66:44 - represents a collection of data for
66:46 - example a data set can contain data from
66:48 - an Excel workbook on OneDrive and
66:49 - on-premises ssas tabular data set and or
66:52 - a Salesforce data set there are many
66:54 - different data sources supported data
66:57 - sets added by one workspace member are
66:59 - available to the other workspace members
67:01 - with an admin member or contributor role
67:04 - so what are shared data sets a shared
67:06 - data set is a data set shared between
67:08 - multiple reports it's important to
67:10 - establish standardized data sets that
67:12 - serve as the one source of Truth
67:13 - discovering and reusing those
67:15 - standardized data sets is also key
67:18 - report creators can use optimized data
67:20 - sets created and shared by expert data
67:22 - modelers in your organization as a
67:24 - starting point when building Reliable
67:25 - Reports your organization can have
67:27 - consistent data for making decisions at
67:29 - a healthy data culture to consume these
67:32 - shared data sets just choose power bi
67:34 - data sets when creating your power bi
67:35 - report
67:37 - moving on to data set types so power bi
67:40 - data sets represent a source of data
67:42 - ready for reporting and visualization
67:43 - there are five different data set types
67:45 - and they can be created in the following
67:47 - ways first by connecting to an existing
67:49 - data model that isn't hosted in a power
67:51 - bi capacity
67:52 - second by uploading a power bi desktop
67:55 - file that contains the model then by
67:58 - uploading an Excel workbook containing
67:59 - one or more Excel tables in our workbook
68:01 - data model or uploading a CSV also known
68:04 - as a comma separated values file
68:06 - you can also use the power bi service to
68:09 - create a push data set and finally we
68:11 - use the power bi service to create a
68:13 - streaming or hybrid streaming data set
68:15 - an exception for this would be for
68:17 - streaming data sets the data set
68:19 - represents a data model which leverages
68:21 - the mature modeling Technologies of
68:22 - analysis services so that's the
68:25 - different kinds of data sets for power
68:27 - bi
68:28 - [Music]
68:32 - so the next component will be discussing
68:34 - are reports at Power B I report is one
68:37 - or more pages of visualizations such as
68:39 - line charts maps and tree maps
68:41 - visualizations are also called visuals
68:43 - power bi allows you to create reports
68:46 - from scratch import them with dashboard
68:47 - shared by co-workers or have it create
68:49 - reports when you connect to data sets
68:51 - like Excel power bi desktop databases
68:54 - and SAS apps for example power bi
68:56 - generates a report using the Power view
68:58 - sheets in an Excel worksheet when you
69:00 - connect to it additionally power bi
69:02 - Imports a pre-built report when you
69:03 - connect to a SAS application
69:06 - so there are two modes to view and
69:07 - interact with reports there is reading
69:09 - View and there is editing view when you
69:11 - open a report it opens in Reading view
69:13 - if you have the edit permissions then
69:15 - you see edit report in the upper left
69:16 - corner and you can view the report in
69:18 - editing view anyone with an admin member
69:21 - or contributor role can edit a report if
69:23 - it is in a workspace they have access to
69:26 - all the exploring designing building and
69:28 - sharing capabilities of editing view for
69:30 - that report the people they share the
69:31 - report with can explore and interact
69:33 - with the report in Reading View
69:35 - when you open a workspace the associated
69:37 - reports are listed under the reports tab
69:39 - each listed report represents one or
69:41 - more pages of visualizations based on
69:43 - only one of the underlying data sets to
69:46 - open a report select it you are
69:48 - presented with a dashboard when you
69:50 - first launch an app
69:51 - select a dashboard tile that was pinned
69:53 - from a report to see the underlying
69:55 - report you might need to click a few
69:57 - tiles before seeing a report because not
69:59 - all tiles are pinned from reports
70:01 - foreign
70:05 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
70:07 - and we'll be going into detail on what
70:09 - is a dashboard in power bi so a
70:12 - dashboard is something you create in the
70:13 - power bi service or something a
70:15 - colleague creates in the power bi
70:16 - service and shares with you it is a
70:18 - single canvas that contains zero or more
70:20 - tiles and widgets each tile pin from a
70:23 - report or from question and answer
70:25 - displays a single visualization that was
70:27 - created from a data set and pinned to
70:28 - the dashboard entire report Pages can
70:31 - also be pinned to a dashboard as a
70:33 - single tile
70:35 - the visualizations you see on the
70:37 - dashboard are called tiles
70:38 - you pin tiles to a dashboard from
70:40 - reports and each report is based on a
70:42 - data set a dashboard is an introduction
70:44 - to the underlying reports and data sets
70:47 - selecting a visualization takes you to
70:49 - the report and data set that it's based
70:51 - on you can pin many kinds of tiles to
70:53 - dashboards you can pin a tile from a
70:55 - report pin a tile from another dashboard
70:57 - pin a tile from Excel you can create a
71:00 - tile in question and answer and pin it
71:02 - you can pin an entire report page and
71:04 - you can also add images videos and more
71:06 - to a dashboard
71:08 - let's take a look at some of the
71:10 - advantages of dashboards first you can
71:12 - see in one glance all the information
71:14 - needed to make decisions you can monitor
71:16 - the most important information about
71:18 - your business you can ensure all
71:20 - colleagues are on the same page viewing
71:22 - and using the same information to
71:23 - monitor the health of a business or
71:25 - product or business unit or marketing
71:27 - campaign Etc and you can create a
71:29 - personalized view of a larger dashboard
71:31 - and show all the metrics that matter to
71:32 - them
71:33 - so that's a general overview of
71:35 - dashboards in power bi
71:39 - foreign
71:42 - users can get confused between a report
71:44 - and a dashboard so we'll go over the
71:46 - main differences between the two because
71:48 - there will definitely be some questions
71:49 - on it in the exam for the pages
71:52 - capability dashboards can only have one
71:54 - page whereas reports can have one or
71:56 - more pages for data sources dashboards
71:58 - can have one or more reports and one or
72:00 - more data sets per dashboard reports can
72:02 - only have a single data set per report
72:04 - for drilling down in visuals this can be
72:07 - done for dashboards only if you pin an
72:08 - entire report page to a dashboard on the
72:11 - other hand drilling down in visuals is
72:13 - available for reports dashboards are not
72:15 - available in power bi desktop reports
72:17 - are available in power bi desktop you
72:20 - can build and view reports in power bi
72:22 - desktop you can't filter or slice a
72:24 - dashboard you can filter a dashboard
72:26 - tile in Focus mode but can't save the
72:28 - filter however filtering is available
72:30 - for reports there are many different
72:31 - ways to filter highlight and slice for
72:34 - favorites you can set multiple
72:35 - dashboards and multiple reports as
72:37 - favorites for natural language queries
72:40 - this is available for both dashboard
72:41 - words and reports but you'll need edit
72:43 - permissions for the report and
72:45 - underlying data set for set alerts this
72:47 - is available for dashboard tiles in
72:49 - certain circumstances but this is not
72:51 - available for reports for the Subscribe
72:53 - capability you can subscribe to
72:55 - dashboard and a report so these are the
72:57 - main capabilities you'll be using for
72:59 - dashboards and reports there are a few
73:01 - more but the list is simply too large to
73:02 - fit
73:04 - foreign
73:07 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
73:10 - and we'll be going through template apps
73:12 - for power bi so power bi Partners can
73:15 - create power bi templates with little to
73:16 - no coding and deploy them to any power
73:18 - bi customer using the new Power bi
73:20 - template apps you can create a set of
73:22 - out-of-the-box content for your
73:24 - customers and publish it yourself as a
73:26 - power bi partner you can build template
73:28 - apps that allow your customers to
73:30 - connect within their own accounts as
73:32 - domain experts they can unlock the data
73:34 - in a way that is easy for their business
73:35 - users to consume template apps are
73:38 - submitted to the partner Center to
73:39 - become publicly available in the power
73:41 - bi apps Marketplace and on Microsoft
73:43 - appsource
73:44 - power bi template apps allow power bi
73:47 - Pro or power bi premium users to gain
73:49 - immediate insights through per package
73:50 - dashboards and reports that can be
73:52 - connected to live data sources many
73:55 - power bi apps are already available in
73:56 - the power bi apps Marketplace such as
73:58 - the covid-19 US tracking report Google
74:01 - analytics report and the Microsoft 365
74:04 - usage Analytics
74:06 - [Music]
74:10 - the next topic we'll be covering is data
74:12 - modeling and visualizations power bi
74:15 - desktop is a free application installed
74:17 - on your local computer that allows you
74:18 - to connect to transform and visualize
74:21 - your data you can connect to multiple
74:23 - different sources of data and combine
74:25 - them which is often called modeling into
74:27 - a data model with power bi desktop you
74:30 - can create visuals and collection of
74:32 - visuals using this data model which you
74:34 - can then share as reports with others
74:35 - most users who work on business
74:37 - intelligence projects create their
74:39 - reports using power bi desktop then
74:42 - share them with others using the power
74:43 - bi service
74:44 - in power bi desktop you will begin to
74:47 - create reports in the report View
74:49 - there are five main areas you will be
74:51 - working with first we have the ribbon
74:53 - this displays the common tasks that are
74:55 - related with reports and visualizations
74:57 - next we have the report view or canvas
75:00 - this is where visualizations are created
75:02 - and arranged the data view allows you to
75:04 - view all your data available in your
75:06 - report it is an easy way to quickly
75:08 - check data types and validate data the
75:11 - model view allows you to visually set
75:12 - the relationship between tables or
75:14 - elements
75:15 - our relationship is where two or more
75:17 - tables are linked together because they
75:19 - contain related data this enables users
75:21 - to run queries for related data across
75:23 - multiple tables
75:24 - the third area we have is the pages tab
75:27 - this area is where you would select or
75:28 - add a report page located along the
75:30 - bottom of the page
75:32 - next we have the visualizations pane
75:34 - this is where you can change
75:35 - visualizations customize colors or axes
75:38 - apply filters drag fields and more and
75:41 - finally we have the fields pane this is
75:43 - where query elements and filters can be
75:45 - dragged onto the report view or dragged
75:47 - to the filters area of the
75:48 - visualizations pane
75:51 - foreign
75:55 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
75:57 - and the next topic we'll be covering is
75:59 - the types of visualization in power bi
76:01 - so starting off with bar and column
76:04 - charts bar charts are the industry
76:06 - standard for viewing specific value
76:07 - across different categories here we have
76:10 - a visual example of a bar chart
76:12 - displaying counts of visits by building
76:14 - and here we have the chart in a column
76:16 - chart format
76:18 - so let's look at some more types of
76:20 - visualizations in power bi
76:22 - first we have cards these can be viewed
76:24 - in single or multi-row
76:26 - next we have kpis these display progress
76:29 - toward a measurable goal
76:31 - next we have Maps basic Maps these are
76:34 - used to associate both categorical and
76:36 - quantitative information with spatial
76:38 - locations
76:39 - then we have pie charts and pie charts
76:42 - show the relationship of parts to a
76:43 - whole
76:45 - another type of visualization is the
76:47 - question and answer visual this lets you
76:49 - ask questions about your data using
76:50 - natural language
76:52 - finally we have tables tables work well
76:55 - with quantitative comparisons among
76:56 - items where there are many categories
76:58 - these are some of the out of the box or
77:01 - pre-built power bi visuals available
77:02 - from the visualization pane in power bi
77:05 - desktop and power bi service however
77:07 - there are some instances where you need
77:09 - a more custom Visual and these can be
77:10 - found in appsource for power bi
77:13 - foreign
77:17 - as mentioned in the previous video there
77:19 - are some instances where users will need
77:21 - a more custom Visual and these can be
77:23 - found in appsource for power bi so power
77:25 - bi visuals are provided to the public by
77:27 - Microsoft and members of the community
77:29 - who then publish them to the app source
77:31 - to make them available for use
77:33 - these visuals can be downloaded and
77:35 - added to your power bi reports Microsoft
77:38 - has tested and approved these power bi
77:40 - visuals for functionality and Quality
77:41 - Power bi certified visuals or visuals in
77:44 - the app source that were additionally
77:46 - tested to check that the visual does not
77:48 - access external services or resources
77:50 - after importing power bi visualizations
77:53 - from appsource updates may happen
77:55 - automatically without further
77:56 - notification
77:58 - so what is appsource app source is the
78:01 - place for apps add-ins and extensions
78:03 - for your Microsoft software appsource
78:06 - connects millions of users of products
78:07 - such as Microsoft 365 Azure Dynamics 365
78:11 - Cortana and power bi to solutions that
78:14 - help them get work done more efficiently
78:15 - and insightfully than before
78:17 - next we have certified power bi visuals
78:21 - certify power bi visuals or visuals and
78:23 - appsource that meet certain specified
78:25 - code requirements that the Microsoft
78:27 - power bi team has tested and approved
78:29 - the tests are designed to check that the
78:31 - visual doesn't access external services
78:33 - or resources
78:34 - so that's a general overview of custom
78:36 - visuals
78:38 - [Music]
78:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
78:44 - and we'll be going over filtering data
78:46 - with power bi in a simple type of
78:48 - filtering called a slicer so data is the
78:50 - core of power bi as you explore reports
78:53 - each visual draws its underlying data
78:55 - from sources that often contain far more
78:56 - data than you need filtering is a
78:59 - technique used to focus on a subset of
79:00 - data in the chart making it easier to
79:02 - analyze and identify patterns or Trends
79:04 - power bi offers several ways to filter
79:07 - and highlight reports knowing how to
79:09 - filter data is the key to finding the
79:10 - right information when you filter a
79:13 - visual like a bar chart you are just
79:14 - changing the view of the data in that
79:16 - visual you are not modifying The Source
79:18 - data in any way remember to keep in mind
79:20 - that filtering only applies to reports
79:22 - not to dashboards a simple type of
79:25 - filtering that you can use directly on
79:27 - the report page is called a slicer
79:28 - slicers provide cues to ways you can
79:31 - filter the results and the visuals on a
79:32 - report page there are several different
79:34 - types of slicers such as numeric
79:36 - categorical and date slicers make it
79:39 - easy to filter all the visuals on the
79:41 - page at once
79:42 - so when should you use a slicer well
79:44 - slicers are a great choice when you want
79:46 - to display commonly used or important
79:49 - filters on the report canvas for easier
79:51 - access make it easier to see the current
79:53 - filtered State without having to open a
79:55 - drop down list filter by columns that
79:57 - are unneeded and hidden in the data
79:58 - tables and when you want to create more
80:01 - focused reports by putting slicers next
80:03 - to important visuals also note that
80:05 - power bi slicers don't support input
80:07 - fields and drilled out options explore
80:10 - the filters pane another way to filter
80:12 - data is by opening and modifying filters
80:15 - in the filters pane the filters pane
80:17 - contains filters that were added to the
80:19 - report by the report designer as a
80:21 - consumer you can interact with the
80:22 - filters and save your changes but cannot
80:24 - add new filters there are four types of
80:27 - filters first we have report this
80:29 - applies to all pages in the report then
80:32 - we have page this applies to all the
80:34 - visuals on the current report page next
80:36 - we have visual this applies to a single
80:38 - visual on a report page you only see
80:41 - visual level filters if you have
80:42 - selected a visual on the report canvas
80:44 - and the last type of filter is drill
80:46 - through this allows you to explore
80:48 - successively more detailed views within
80:50 - a single visual
80:52 - [Music]
80:56 - moving on to our next topic buttons in
80:58 - power bi so using buttons in power bi
81:01 - lets you create reports that behave like
81:03 - apps and thereby create an engaging
81:05 - environment so users can hover click and
81:07 - further interact with power bi material
81:09 - you can add buttons to reports and power
81:11 - bi desktop and in the power bi service
81:13 - when you share your reports in the power
81:15 - bi service they provide an app like
81:17 - experience for your users to create a
81:20 - button in power bi desktop on the insert
81:22 - ribbon select buttons and a drop down
81:24 - menu appears where you can select the
81:25 - button you want from a collection of
81:27 - options as shown in the image
81:30 - here are some key features and
81:31 - characteristics of buttons and power bi
81:33 - appearance buttons and power bi can be
81:36 - customized with various shapes sizes
81:38 - colors and text to fit the report design
81:40 - action buttons can be configured to
81:43 - perform a variety of actions including
81:45 - filtering data navigating to a different
81:47 - page or report opening a URL or file or
81:50 - running a custom script interaction
81:52 - buttons can be clicked by users to
81:54 - trigger the configured action and can be
81:56 - used to create a more interactive and
81:57 - engaging report experience selection
82:00 - buttons can be used as a selection tool
82:02 - to filter or highlight specific data by
82:04 - configuring them with a slicer or other
82:06 - interactive element
82:07 - integration buttons can be integrated
82:09 - with other power bi features and
82:11 - components such as bookmarks drill
82:13 - through actions and visual interactions
82:15 - to create a more Dynamic and customized
82:17 - report experience
82:19 - so that's a general overview of buttons
82:21 - and power bi
82:23 - [Music]
82:27 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
82:30 - and the next topic we'll be covering is
82:31 - power query editor so sometimes your
82:34 - data might contain extra data or have
82:36 - data in the wrong format you may need
82:38 - additional columns or to rename or hide
82:40 - existing columns you may have multiple
82:43 - data sources and need to define a
82:45 - relationship between them all these
82:47 - tasks are known as data transformation
82:48 - power bi desktop includes the power
82:51 - query editor tool which can help you
82:53 - shape and transform data so that it's
82:54 - ready for your models and visualizations
82:56 - power query editor is a data
82:59 - transformation in preparation tool that
83:00 - allows users to connect to and transform
83:02 - data from a variety of sources like
83:04 - Excel spreadsheets text files databases
83:07 - and web services with power query editor
83:10 - users can extract transform and load
83:12 - data from these sources into Power bi
83:14 - for analysis and visualization it
83:16 - provides a user-friendly interface for
83:18 - data manipulation allowing users to
83:20 - filter sort group pivot and aggregate
83:23 - data using a series of intuitive and
83:24 - easy to use menus and tools it also
83:27 - supports it's merging splitting and
83:29 - unpivoting tables custom calculations
83:31 - and Transformations a key feature of
83:34 - power query editor is its ability to
83:35 - create reusable data queries which can
83:37 - be saved and shared with other users or
83:39 - used to automate data refreshes this can
83:42 - save significant time and effort for
83:43 - users who need to regularly transform
83:45 - and update large data sets
83:48 - launch power query Editor to begin
83:50 - select edit from the Navigator window to
83:52 - launch power query editor you can also
83:55 - launch power query editor directly from
83:56 - Power bi desktop by using the transform
83:58 - data button on the home ribbon in the
84:01 - ribbon the active buttons enable you to
84:03 - interact with the data in the query on
84:05 - the left pane queries are listed and
84:07 - available for selecting viewing and
84:09 - shaping on the center pane data from the
84:11 - selected query is displayed and
84:13 - available for shaping the query settings
84:15 - window lists the queries properties and
84:17 - applied steps so this is the general
84:20 - layout of the power query editor
84:24 - foreign
84:28 - so the next topic we'll be covering is
84:30 - an aggregate at times there may be a
84:33 - need to perform mathematical
84:34 - calculations on the values within your
84:36 - data the mathematical operation could be
84:38 - some average maximum count and so on
84:40 - this process of merging values in your
84:43 - data using mathematical operations is
84:45 - referred to as aggregation the outcome
84:47 - of the calculation is known as an
84:48 - aggregate
84:49 - when power bi service and power bi
84:52 - desktop create visualizations they may
84:54 - aggregate your data in some cases the
84:56 - resulting aggregate may be appropriate
84:57 - but at other times you may want to apply
84:59 - a different type of aggregation to the
85:01 - data such as calculating the sum or
85:03 - average of values
85:05 - there are several different ways to
85:06 - manage and change the aggregate power bi
85:08 - uses in a visualization
85:11 - typically data sets consist of multiple
85:13 - types of data and at the simplest level
85:15 - the data can be classified as either
85:17 - numeric or non-numeric
85:19 - Tower bi can aggregate numeric data
85:21 - using a sum average count minimum
85:23 - variance and much more additionally
85:25 - power bi can even aggregate non-numeric
85:28 - data which is often referred to as
85:29 - categorical data
85:31 - if you try to aggregate a categorical
85:33 - field by placing it in a numeric only
85:35 - bucket like values or tooltips power B I
85:37 - will count the occurrences of each
85:38 - category or count the distinct
85:40 - occurrences of each category special
85:42 - types of data like dates have a few of
85:44 - their own aggregate options earliest
85:46 - latest first and last
85:48 - for example according to the image
85:50 - provided units sold a manufacturing
85:53 - price or columns that contain numeric
85:55 - data segment country region product
85:58 - month and month name contain categorical
86:00 - data
86:01 - here we'll look at some of the ways to
86:03 - aggregate your data some of the options
86:06 - that may be available for aggregating a
86:08 - field do not summarize with this option
86:10 - chosen power bi treats each value in
86:12 - that field separately and doesn't
86:14 - summarize them so then this adds all the
86:17 - values in that field up average this
86:19 - takes an arithmetic mean of the values
86:21 - minimum this shows the smallest value
86:24 - maximum this shows the largest value
86:27 - count not blanks this counts the number
86:30 - of values in that field that are blank
86:32 - count the stanctive this counts the
86:34 - number of different values in that field
86:36 - standard deviation variance and median
86:40 - this shows the median value this value
86:43 - has the same number of items above and
86:45 - below if there are two medians power bi
86:47 - averages them
86:49 - foreign
86:53 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
86:56 - and we'll be covering the power bi
86:57 - security and administration power bi
87:00 - like many other Microsoft Services
87:01 - utilizes Azure as its foundation Azure
87:05 - is the cloud computing infrastructure
87:06 - and platform developed by Microsoft that
87:08 - guarantees the same level of security
87:10 - for power bi as other Microsoft Services
87:12 - when users sign into Power bi they use
87:15 - their credentials saved in Azure active
87:17 - directory which permits them to control
87:19 - the level of sharing for each report
87:20 - data or dashboard
87:22 - they can determine whether recipients
87:24 - are permitted to edit or just view the
87:26 - items
87:27 - it's important to note that users are
87:29 - responsible for the data they share
87:31 - if a user connects to data sources using
87:33 - their credentials they can share a
87:35 - report or dashboard or data set based on
87:37 - that data users with whom the dashboard
87:40 - is shared are authenticated against the
87:41 - original data source and will be granted
87:43 - access to the report this is beneficial
87:46 - to allow users to share reports and
87:48 - dashboards they have created but does
87:49 - require responsibility on the user's
87:51 - part
87:53 - power bi Administration is the
87:55 - management of a power bi tenant
87:56 - including the configuration of
87:58 - governance policies usage monitoring and
88:00 - provisioning of licenses capacities and
88:03 - organizational resources power bi is
88:06 - designed for self-service business
88:07 - intelligence the administrator is the
88:10 - guardian of data processes and policies
88:12 - in the power bi tenant a power bi
88:14 - administrator is a key member of a team
88:16 - that includes bi developers analysts and
88:19 - other roles the administrator can help
88:21 - support an organization to make sure
88:22 - that critical goals are met
88:24 - so that's a general overview of the
88:26 - power bi security and administration
88:30 - [Music]
88:34 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
88:37 - and we'll be starting off by creating a
88:39 - Microsoft account so the first thing you
88:41 - want to do is to go to this link here
88:43 - called power.bi dot microsoft.com
88:47 - us and this will take you to this page
88:50 - here you can do this with other Power
88:52 - Platform services like power apps or
88:54 - power automate but since we'll be
88:56 - starting with power bi we'll be using
88:58 - this link and if you don't already have
89:00 - a Microsoft account you'd want to
89:01 - navigate to this button here and click
89:03 - on the try free button so this is the
89:05 - page where you would create your
89:07 - Microsoft account and enter in your

89:10 - the other information required let's go
89:13 - with this one Andrew Brown exam Pro
89:15 - gmail.com
89:17 - so for this method of registration you
89:19 - will need a work email so you can't use
89:21 - a commercial email account such as
89:23 - Hotmail and Gmail
89:25 - however there is another method to sign
89:27 - up
89:28 - this will require you to navigate to
89:30 - this page microsoft.com
89:35 - 365 slash Enterprise slash compare Dash
89:39 - office Dash 365-plans
89:43 - this page provides you with a few Office
89:45 - 365 and Microsoft 365 apps plans such as
89:49 - Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise Office

89:57 - there is an option to try for free and
90:00 - this will allow you to access and use
90:02 - all the apps on this list depending on
90:04 - the plan they may provide partial use of
90:06 - the app or some of the lower cost plans
90:08 - may not include some features the key
90:10 - apps that we're interested in are power
90:12 - apps power automate power virtual agents
90:15 - and power bi we'll be going with the
90:17 - Office 365 E5 plan because it includes
90:20 - power bi Pro so let's click on the try
90:22 - for free button here we'll enter in our
90:25 - email address Andrew Brown exam Pro
90:27 - gmail.com
90:29 - the list here shows all the apps and
90:31 - services you'll be getting in the Office
90:32 - 365 E5 trial plan and remember that you
90:36 - have a one month free trial so you have
90:38 - to cancel the trial before that day to
90:39 - avoid any fees
90:41 - so click on next then click on setup
90:44 - account
90:45 - now we'll need to provide information
90:47 - such as our first name surname business
90:49 - phone number company name company size
90:51 - and the country we reside in once we're
90:54 - done that we have to accept the terms of
90:56 - service
90:57 - looks like we have to provide a
90:59 - verification code let's enter that code
91:02 - in and verify to proceed next we have to
91:05 - create a domain name we'll try to keep
91:07 - it simple so let's go with exam Pro
91:09 - looks like exam Pro is already taken so
91:12 - let's try to add a one it's available so
91:15 - we can use this after that's complete we
91:17 - can create a password and confirm the
91:19 - password
91:20 - then press next
91:24 - next we'll have to add a payment method
91:27 - so you'll need to enter in your card
91:28 - information here and everything else
91:30 - that is required once again you'll have
91:32 - to remember to cancel before the one
91:33 - month period to avoid any charges on
91:35 - your card
91:37 - after that's complete we'll have to
91:39 - review all the information that we
91:41 - entered in and confirm to start the
91:43 - trial
91:44 - it'll just take a bit to add the
91:46 - products to our account but once that's
91:48 - complete we can start using the Office
91:50 - 365 E5 trial so click on that
91:55 - remember to use your domain email that
91:57 - we just created to sign in so in this
91:59 - case it's Andrew Brown at exam Pro one
92:02 - dot on microsoft.com
92:06 - enter in your password and click on sign
92:09 - in
92:18 - if you want to install Microsoft 365 on
92:21 - your computer you can click on here I
92:23 - already have it on my system so I can
92:25 - skip this step for the domain we can use
92:27 - the default exam Pro one dot on
92:29 - microsoft.com for now
92:32 - we won't need to add any users or assign
92:34 - licenses for now
92:36 - we can continue here as well
92:39 - after that's all done we can go to the
92:41 - admin Center
92:46 - feel free to look around the settings
92:48 - and features if you want to
92:50 - but now that we have a Microsoft account
92:52 - we should be able to log into the power
92:54 - bi platform
92:56 - so first we want to go back to the power
92:58 - bi dot microsoft.com earlier at the
93:01 - beginning then we want to click on the
93:03 - sign in page we can use our Microsoft
93:05 - account email that we created so we can
93:07 - just copy that onto here then click on
93:10 - submit this should log us into the power
93:12 - bi service
93:14 - now we have access to the power bi
93:16 - service and we can play around with it
93:18 - so that's how you can create a Microsoft
93:21 - account
93:23 - [Music]
93:26 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
93:29 - and we'll be looking at how to build a
93:31 - basic dashboard by using power bi so the
93:34 - first thing you want to do is to go to
93:35 - the power bi page at
93:37 - app.powerbi.com home here you'll be at
93:41 - the home page for power bi which will
93:43 - have recommendations for you to go to
93:45 - such as your recent workspaces what
93:47 - you've frequently opened how to get
93:48 - started and much more so on the left
93:51 - side pane we have a bunch of tabs such
93:53 - as create browse data Hub metrics and so
93:56 - on before we create our own report and
93:58 - dashboard let's quickly go through a
94:00 - sample report that power bi has provided
94:02 - for us so we'll click on learning under
94:05 - samples we'll click on Revenue
94:07 - opportunities
94:10 - so now you're seeing a power bi Report
94:12 - with nice visuals and a breakdown of the
94:14 - revenue opportunities report we have the
94:17 - opportunity revenue and opportunity
94:19 - count on the top left there is the
94:21 - opportunity count by region and pipeline
94:23 - by stage on the bottom left the revenue
94:25 - and opportunity count by month is
94:27 - located on the top right and the revenue
94:29 - by region and state is on the bottom
94:31 - right they are presented with different
94:33 - kinds of visuals like bar graphs line
94:35 - graphs map visuals gradients and so on
94:38 - we're also able to interact with the
94:40 - visuals so if you want to filter out
94:42 - certain regions metrics or any component
94:44 - of the graph you can do that
94:46 - for example if I only want to know the
94:48 - opportunity count by region in the East
94:50 - I can click on the East bar and it'll
94:52 - only show and calculate the values and
94:54 - highlighted areas for the results
94:57 - on the left side page if I click on
94:59 - detail it will show us the underlying
95:01 - table that has The Columns of data used
95:02 - to create the report
95:04 - so let's go back to the report
95:07 - and we'll click on the edit button in
95:09 - the middle
95:11 - this is where you can edit your entire
95:12 - report you have many kinds of
95:14 - visualizations available and filters you
95:17 - can select the data you want in a
95:19 - specific Visual and stylize it to your
95:21 - liking on the right we have the
95:23 - visualizations pane this is where you
95:25 - can build your visual with all kinds of
95:27 - charts like bar chart column chart line
95:29 - chart scatter chart pie chart map chart
95:31 - and many more so let's take a look at
95:34 - the bottom left chart here it's
95:36 - currently a stack bar chart but we can
95:38 - click on stack column chart and it'll
95:40 - change to it right away you can try out
95:42 - other visuals and experiment to see if
95:44 - it fits with the data selected
95:48 - but let's leave it at the stack column
95:50 - chart for now and if we click on the
95:53 - format visual button in the middle we
95:54 - can format the visual of the graph to
95:56 - whatever we want there are many settings
95:58 - we can change for example we can click
96:00 - on columns then click on the colors tab
96:03 - we can remove the conditional formatting
96:05 - of the gradient and add in a solid color
96:07 - or we can change the conditional
96:09 - formatting of the color to what we want
96:12 - we could also change the spacing of the
96:14 - columns to match the size that fits the
96:15 - graph or however thin or thick you want
96:19 - you have plenty of other options such as
96:21 - grid lines data labels and so on
96:25 - there are also General properties where
96:27 - you can edit the properties like the
96:28 - height and size of the chart as well as
96:30 - the position
96:32 - and we can choose to leave the title
96:34 - Auto or not
96:36 - there are additional effects you can add
96:38 - or change in the background visual
96:40 - border Shadow and much more
96:43 - on the right side we have the data pane
96:45 - this shows all the data available that
96:48 - you can use to create the visuals
96:50 - so if we were to click on the pipeline
96:52 - by stage graph we can see that it shows
96:54 - the data that has been used in the
96:56 - visual with the check boxes in this case
96:58 - we've used opportunity count and sales
97:00 - stage
97:01 - we can select different Columns of data
97:04 - and choose the kind of visual that fits
97:05 - it best
97:07 - for example I can choose something like
97:09 - product code and revenue and it'll
97:12 - change the graph using the data that
97:13 - I've selected
97:15 - we will also need to change the title of
97:17 - the graph so we'll go to format your
97:18 - visual then click on General and click
97:20 - on title change the text of the title to
97:23 - something fitting like product code by
97:24 - Revenue
97:25 - so you basically choose what you want to
97:27 - display on your report using the data
97:29 - that you have presented and stylize the
97:31 - visuals to your liking
97:33 - on the Middle top here we have something
97:34 - called ask a question this is a pretty
97:37 - neat feature where you can ask a
97:38 - question about your data it will provide
97:41 - you with suggested questions for you to
97:42 - start out and you can show all
97:44 - suggestions for more results so we can
97:46 - test this out by clicking on something
97:48 - like top states by factored revenue and
97:51 - it'll provide us with the top states by
97:52 - factored Revenue using the data we
97:54 - provided you can select other questions
97:56 - to try out or you can ask your own
97:58 - questions related to the data
98:02 - the next thing we'll be doing is
98:03 - creating a dashboard okay so let's click
98:06 - on the save button on the top right
98:09 - next we'll click on pin to a dashboard
98:11 - select new dashboard and we'll need to
98:14 - give the dashboard a name so we can use
98:16 - the same name as before Revenue
98:17 - opportunities then click on Pin live
98:21 - after that we can click on go to
98:23 - dashboard
98:25 - so this is the dashboard of Revenue
98:28 - opportunities
98:29 - similarly to the report we can interact
98:31 - with the dashboard visuals and select
98:33 - the key points of data that we want to
98:35 - see there is also a drop down menu for
98:37 - the product code to filter out the
98:39 - product codes and more
98:41 - the dashboard has a built-in question
98:43 - and answer at the top so you can ask
98:45 - questions about your data similarly to a
98:47 - report it will provide you with a visual
98:49 - of data that corresponds with the
98:51 - question asked going back to the
98:53 - dashboard we can edit the dashboard by
98:55 - adding a tile or changing the dashboard
98:57 - theme for example I can change the
98:59 - dashboard theme from light to dark
99:01 - making it easier on the eyes
99:03 - for adding a tile we can add many
99:05 - sources of media such as web content
99:07 - images text boxes videos as well as
99:09 - real-time data we won't need to know
99:12 - this for the exam but you can play
99:13 - around with the power bi features as you
99:15 - like
99:17 - [Music]
99:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
99:23 - and we'll be covering how to create a
99:25 - basic report in dashboard if you want to
99:28 - create your own report and dashboard
99:29 - instead of using a sample report you
99:32 - will need a data set if you have your
99:34 - own data set then you can upload by
99:35 - going to my workspace here you can
99:37 - upload your data from OneDrive for
99:39 - business SharePoint or you can browse
99:41 - from your own PC they must be a pbix RDL
99:44 - or xlsx file I'll upload the sales data
99:48 - economic analysis I downloaded earlier
99:50 - if you don't have a data set at hand you
99:52 - can search for what online there are
99:54 - plenty of sources on the internet that
99:56 - provide free data sets for you to learn
99:58 - and practice for example you can go to
100:00 - kaggle.com which is an online platform
100:03 - that offers a variety of resources for
100:05 - data scientists and machine learning
100:06 - practitioners such as data sets and
100:09 - tools to facilitate collaboration and
100:11 - learning I found a data set here called
100:13 - sales data for economic data analysis I
100:16 - clean the data up a bit and trim some of
100:18 - the data to make things less complicated
100:19 - you can use whichever date data set you
100:22 - find or what
100:23 - another way to upload data is simply
100:25 - copying or manually entering in data so
100:28 - you can click on create on the left side
100:30 - click on paste or manually enter data
100:33 - from your Excel file Google Sheets or
100:36 - any source that has a data set you can
100:37 - copy and paste the data into the table
100:39 - if your data has headers in the first
100:41 - row you want to click on the use first
100:43 - row as headers you also want to rename
100:46 - the table so we'll rename this to sales
100:48 - data economic
100:49 - we can choose to Auto create report
100:51 - create a blank report or create a data
100:53 - set only but we'll choose autocreate
100:56 - report to use as a starting point
101:00 - okay here we are free to play around
101:02 - with the current design we have
101:04 - first we need to change this to edit
101:06 - mode so click on that
101:08 - then we need to change some of the data
101:10 - on the graphs to the data that we're
101:11 - interested in and to ensure that the
101:13 - data makes sense because sometimes the
101:14 - auto create report uses data like total
101:16 - sum of age which is something we don't
101:18 - want
101:22 - so I've chosen the data that I want for
101:24 - my graphs and the types of visuals that
101:26 - look appropriate for them now we'll be
101:28 - adjusting the size of the canvas and
101:30 - we'll try to go for a different look to
101:32 - do this we'll go to the format page then
101:35 - canvas settings and we'll want to select
101:36 - a custom type so we can change the
101:38 - height and width that suits the report
101:40 - we can enter in something like 1000
101:42 - pixels height and 1200 pixels width you
101:45 - can choose what you think is best
101:47 - after that we'll be moving around the
101:49 - graphs and visuals to see where we want
101:51 - to place them or if we think it looks
101:53 - suitable
101:54 - we'll also be adjusting the sizes of the
101:57 - graphs in visuals so it makes sense or
101:58 - looks decent enough
102:01 - I'll be speeding through this section
102:02 - because it's mostly just adjusting the
102:04 - graph's positions and making sure they
102:06 - align well with the canvas so you won't
102:08 - be missing out on anything too important
102:12 - we want to try something a little unique
102:14 - so we'll be providing it with a dark
102:16 - background
102:17 - you will need to go to format page then
102:19 - click on canvas background
102:21 - change the color to a dark color and
102:24 - lower the transparency so that it's
102:25 - visible
102:26 - you can also use an image that you have
102:28 - on your personal computer by clicking
102:30 - browse
102:31 - we'll be using a dark blue gradient
102:33 - background we found with a simple Google
102:35 - search
102:36 - after seeing the white boxes I've made a
102:39 - few more adjustments to the placements
102:40 - of the graphs
102:42 - we will need to remove the white boxes
102:43 - from the graphs and text boxes so we'll
102:46 - need to click on effects and turn off
102:47 - the background
102:49 - so we'll have to adjust the font to
102:51 - White so it's easier to read
103:13 - we'll need to do this for these visual
103:15 - cards so it's the same process click on
103:18 - category labels then change the font
103:20 - color to white
103:22 - then on the callout values also change
103:24 - the font to White
103:29 - for the graphs we'll need to turn the
103:31 - background off so click on General then
103:33 - click on effects then click the toggle
103:35 - to turn the background off
103:37 - then you need to click on visual then
103:39 - click on the x-axis here you will need
103:42 - to change the value font to White then
103:44 - you will need to change the title font
103:45 - to White
103:47 - you will also need to change the font
103:49 - color to white for the y-axis
103:59 - you will need to change the title font
104:01 - to White so you'll have to click on data
104:03 - labels then click on values then change
104:05 - the font to White
104:10 - you will need to change the title font
104:12 - to White
104:22 - I realized I forgot to change the
104:25 - transparency to zero so you'll be able
104:26 - to see the dark blue gradient
104:29 - so as you can see it's starting to look
104:31 - better we'll continue to change the
104:33 - fonts for the remaining graphs we will
104:35 - apply the same steps like the sub of
104:37 - Revenue by month graph so we'll need to
104:39 - change the x-axis and y-axis fonts to
104:42 - White and we'll need to change the color
104:43 - of the title and data labels to White
104:45 - and we need to turn off the background
104:49 - so we'll be speeding through this
104:51 - process since we already know how to
104:52 - execute this
105:09 - the bar colors look at bit plain so
105:11 - we'll add a gradient effect to make it
105:13 - look more interesting
105:15 - to do this we'll click on format visual
105:17 - then click on bars then click on the FX
105:20 - button the default gradient color they
105:22 - provided looks decided so we'll press ok
105:27 - we also want to turn off the legend
105:29 - since it automatically turned on once we
105:31 - applied a gradient
105:33 - we'll try to apply this to the other
105:35 - graphs as well so we'll go through the
105:37 - same procedure click on bars then click
105:39 - on the FX button we want to keep the
105:41 - orange color to mix it up a bit so we'll
105:43 - try to find lighter orange for the
105:45 - minimum then we'll find a darker orange
105:46 - for the maximum
105:48 - then click OK we'll also want to get rid
105:51 - of the legend since it doesn't look too
105:52 - appealing in my opinion
105:56 - same process for the final graph we'll
105:58 - also give it a gradient
106:03 - okay so this looks fine it's not perfect
106:06 - but it's definitely more interesting
106:08 - than the default design that they
106:09 - provided for us
106:12 - after that you can save the report and
106:14 - we can do the same thing as we did in
106:15 - the previous video
106:17 - pin to dashboard and Pin live
106:20 - so all in all you can customize and
106:22 - design the report however you want using
106:24 - all the tools effects colors visuals
106:27 - available in power bi until you are
106:28 - satisfied with your design
106:32 - [Music]
106:35 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
106:38 - and we'll be covering power apps in

111:32 - [Music]
111:34 - you can use AI builder in Microsoft
111:36 - power apps in one of two ways depending
111:38 - on the model you will be using you can
111:40 - use AI models in the formula bar or add
111:43 - AI Builder components use AI models in
111:46 - the formula bar you can get support for
111:48 - the following AI Builder models that use
111:50 - power apps through the formula bar here
111:52 - is a table that shows the model types
111:54 - available and the build types you can
111:56 - use it's either pre-built or built and
111:58 - custom for the sentiment analysis model
112:00 - type the build type is pre-built for
112:03 - entity extraction the build type is for

112:18 - provides two kinds of power apps
112:19 - components choose your component based
112:21 - on the models you want to use components
112:24 - that use per built AI models that are
112:25 - ready to use right away business card
112:27 - reader for canvas app business card
112:30 - reader for model driven app receipt
112:32 - processor for canvas app and text
112:35 - recognizer for canvas app components
112:38 - that use custom AI models that you build
112:40 - and train form processor and object
112:43 - detector
112:44 - the business card reader is an example
112:46 - of a pre-built component that uses AI
112:48 - components which can also be used in
112:50 - other ways by creating a custom model
112:52 - to create a model users can follow a
112:55 - step-by-step process using the wizard
112:56 - available on make.powerapps.com
112:59 - currently powerapps offers four AI
113:01 - models which are prediction this model
113:04 - uses historical data to predict future
113:06 - events form processor this model can
113:09 - extract text from images such as with
113:11 - the business card reader object detector
113:13 - this model can identify objects and
113:15 - images and provide a count of the number
113:17 - of objects present text classification
113:19 - this model categorizes text by its
113:22 - meaning to facilitate analysis
113:24 - the prediction model the AI Builders
113:27 - prediction model allows users to
113:28 - generate a model that can predict yes or
113:30 - no outcomes based on historical data you
113:32 - train the model by providing historical
113:34 - data that includes the yes no outcome AI
113:36 - builder takes care of the rest with the
113:39 - prediction model users can create
113:40 - solutions for various business problems
113:42 - such as will Elite convert to a customer

113:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
113:59 - and in this section we'll be covering
114:00 - the functions in powerapps in a bit more
114:02 - detail
114:03 - when working with Microsoft power apps
114:05 - you don't need to have expertise in
114:07 - writing complex application code like a
114:09 - professional developer however you still
114:11 - need to express the app's logic and
114:13 - manage its features such as navigation
114:15 - filtering and sorting this is where
114:17 - formulas become useful
114:19 - if you're familiar with Microsoft Excel
114:21 - functions you'll find it easy to develop
114:23 - apps using power apps to create a
114:25 - formula you'll combine one or more
114:27 - formulas with the necessary and optional
114:28 - parameters
114:30 - these are some common functions used in
114:32 - powerapps and their purposes
114:34 - filter this function is typically used
114:36 - in conjunction with tables or galleries
114:38 - of data to narrow down the rows
114:40 - retrieved from the data source by
114:41 - specifying one or more columns in your
114:43 - data set to perform a logical test on
114:45 - you can return data that falls within a
114:47 - specific date range as a particular
114:49 - value or was created by the user for
114:51 - instance
114:52 - match this function allows you to check
114:54 - whether a value follows a specified
114:56 - pattern you can utilize it to validate
114:58 - if the user has entered a correctly
115:00 - formatted email address and if not
115:02 - display a warning message indicating
115:03 - that a valid email is required this
115:05 - function is particularly useful for
115:07 - conditional formatting
115:09 - distinct this function enables you to
115:11 - retrieve the unique values from a list
115:13 - of data simplifying the process of
115:14 - creating Dynamic drop down menus that
115:16 - display only valid values for a given
115:18 - column
115:19 - math functions powerapps features a
115:21 - variety of math formulas for
115:23 - manipulating your data ranging from
115:25 - simple operations like sum and average
115:26 - to more advanced functions such as aten
115:28 - and sin for working with radians
115:32 - [Music]
115:36 - power apps can create three types of
115:38 - apps canvas model driven and portals
115:41 - each is suited to different scenarios
115:43 - and end users the first one we'll be
115:45 - covering are canvas apps
115:47 - so canvas apps are a low code
115:49 - application development platform that
115:51 - allows users to create custom business
115:52 - applications using a drag and drop
115:54 - interface
115:56 - with canvas apps users start with a
115:58 - blank canvas and add controls such as
116:00 - buttons labels and text boxes to create
116:02 - a custom user interface users can then
116:05 - connect these controls to data sources
116:07 - such as Microsoft 365 Dynamics 365
116:11 - SharePoint or other third-party data
116:13 - sources to create data-driven
116:15 - applications
116:16 - canvas apps offer extensive
116:18 - customization options allowing users to
116:20 - modify the appearance and behavior of
116:22 - controls create custom formulas and
116:24 - expressions and integrate with other
116:26 - Microsoft services
116:28 - they can also be deployed to a variety
116:29 - of platforms including web browsers and
116:32 - mobile devices
116:33 - canvas apps are best suited for
116:35 - scenarios where a high degree of
116:36 - customization and flexibility is
116:38 - required such as when building custom
116:40 - business processes or workflows
116:43 - some common use cases and capabilities
116:45 - of canvas apps include custom forms and
116:48 - data entry canvas apps can be used to
116:50 - create custom forms and data entry
116:52 - interfaces that can be integrated with
116:54 - various data sources like Microsoft
116:55 - Excel SharePoint or Dynamics 365 this
116:59 - makes it easier to collect and organize
117:01 - data in a way that is specific to your
117:03 - business requirements
117:04 - workflow automation with canvas apps
117:07 - users can build custom workflows that
117:08 - automate business processes like
117:10 - approvals notifications or routing of
117:12 - work items this capability can be
117:14 - integrated with power automate enabling
117:16 - you to connect to over 275 external
117:19 - services and apis
117:21 - custom dashboards and analytics canvas

118:12 - apps has many different components to
118:14 - build Solutions including screens inputs
118:16 - galleries forms and more
118:19 - power app studio is the web-based
118:21 - interface that enables you to create
118:22 - your app without requiring you to
118:24 - download or install a separate client by
118:26 - logging into https colon slash
118:29 - make.powerapps.com from your browser you
118:31 - can build your app entirely online using
118:33 - powerapps
118:34 - app for vet the first step in creating
118:36 - your app is to choose the format of your
118:38 - app mobile or tablet while both formats
118:41 - are compatible with mobile device a
118:42 - tablet or a computer each has different
118:44 - defaults regarding the size of the
118:46 - screens and controls once you choose the
118:48 - format for an app you cannot change it
118:50 - galleries the gallery control is used to
118:53 - display rows from a table of data the
118:55 - display of a row is then defined by a
118:57 - template which you can customize to meet
118:59 - your needs this allows you to control
119:00 - which columns are shown and how they are
119:02 - formatted power apps will then apply
119:04 - this template automatically to every Row
119:06 - in your data
119:08 - forms forms are focused on working with
119:11 - a specific record often based on a
119:13 - selection from a gallery and this
119:15 - experience a user browses a gallery to
119:17 - find and select the desired row to view
119:18 - the details on the form forms enable a
119:21 - user to not only view detailed
119:22 - information but to save new records and
119:24 - edit existing ones the various actions
119:26 - performed with forms are controlled by
119:28 - Form nodes allowing the form to serve
119:30 - many purposes
119:32 - input controls powerapps provides a wide
119:35 - range of input controls to offer maximum
119:37 - flexibility while customizing your apps
119:39 - these controls include text inputs
119:41 - buttons drop-downs toggles date Pickers
119:44 - and Sliders among others
119:46 - you can seamlessly integrate these
119:48 - controls into galleries forms and
119:50 - screens to create an aesthetically
119:51 - appealing and functional app furthermore
119:53 - all these inputs come with various
119:55 - settings for default data formatting and
119:57 - actions empowering you to develop an app
119:59 - that offers an optimal user experience
120:01 - for your business process
120:03 - intelligent controls in addition to
120:06 - Common inputs powerapps also provides a

120:13 - controls that provide access to features
120:14 - like the camera Barcode Scanner GPS and
120:17 - other Hardware related functionalities
120:19 - there are also service backed controls
120:21 - like the business card reader and object
120:22 - detector which enable you to incorporate
120:24 - artificial intelligence into your app
120:26 - without writing any code
120:28 - functions functions play a crucial role
120:31 - in connecting controls inputs and data
120:33 - sources and power apps by using
120:35 - functions you can create formulas that
120:37 - perform various actions such as
120:39 - formatting data sending data to a data
120:41 - source or creating animations
120:43 - these formulas are similar to excel
120:45 - functions and do not require complex
120:47 - coding they are easy to use and can
120:49 - enhance the functionality of your app
120:52 - [Music]
120:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
120:58 - and we'll be looking at how to build a
121:00 - basic canvas app
121:02 - so before we begin we'll need a sample
121:04 - data set that we can provide to
121:05 - powerapps which will enable it to
121:07 - connect and create a canvas app we will
121:10 - need to navigate to this
121:12 - pagelearn.microsoft.com and US slash
121:15 - power Dash apps slash maker slash canvas
121:19 - Dash apps slash get Dash started Dash
121:21 - create Dash from Dash data this page
121:24 - provides steps to create a canvas app
121:26 - with data from an Excel file and
121:28 - provides a sample data set we can use
121:30 - there are many data connectors to use
121:32 - but for this example we'll use an Excel
121:34 - file you are free to use your own Excel
121:36 - file but the data must be formatted as a
121:38 - table so the first thing we'll have to
121:41 - do is download the flooring estimates
121:42 - Excel file I already have the file
121:45 - downloaded on my computer so I won't
121:46 - need to download it again once you have
121:48 - it downloaded you'll want to upload this
121:50 - file onto your OneDrive so you'll have
121:53 - to go to the OneDrive this is part of
121:55 - your Microsoft 365 account and is linked
121:57 - to apps like powerapps power bi power
121:59 - automate and other apps click on upload
122:01 - then file then choose the flooring
122:04 - estimates Excel file I already have it
122:06 - uploaded on my OneDrive so I won't need
122:08 - to upload it after you're finished
122:09 - uploading you'll need to navigate to the
122:11 - powerapps page to do that you can click
122:14 - on the top left Square dots then click
122:16 - on all apps then you can use the search
122:18 - tool or you can scroll down to find
122:20 - power apps click on power apps to open
122:23 - the powerapps page
122:25 - once we have arrived here we want to
122:27 - click on create
122:29 - as you can see there are many
122:30 - connections to choose from but we'll be
122:32 - using the Excel file we uploaded so
122:34 - we'll click on Excel
122:39 - so after you click on Excel you want to
122:41 - click on OneDrive for business if you
122:44 - don't have a OneDrive for business
122:45 - connection already you'll be prompted to
122:47 - create one by clicking the new
122:48 - connection button then you'll click on
122:50 - the flooring estimates file
122:53 - choose the table and click on connect
123:02 - here you will see an app that is created
123:04 - with the flooring estimates data
123:06 - you can press the play button or F5 to
123:09 - preview the app and play here it
123:11 - provides the entire list of items in the
123:13 - Excel file that we provided it has
123:15 - structured the data in an interactive
123:16 - canvas app which displays the images and
123:18 - details on each item and it includes
123:20 - multiple functions such as a search
123:22 - option new item button and more you can
123:25 - click on the right arrow to view the
123:26 - item in more detail it will provide the
123:28 - category the image the name a
123:30 - description and a price for the specific
123:32 - item there is an edit button to edit out
123:34 - the specific fields that we've mentioned
123:38 - and there is a delete button to delete
123:40 - the item
123:42 - there's also a sort list button to sort
123:44 - by alphabetical order
123:46 - and a refresh button in case one of your
123:49 - team members has updated the Excel data
123:51 - set so you can click on the X on the top
123:53 - right or press escape to go back to the
123:55 - previous working canvas view also
123:57 - there's a good tip here where you can
123:59 - hold the ALT key to activate buttons and
124:01 - other controls while you are working on
124:03 - the app normally if you click on the
124:05 - buttons you'll just select and highlight
124:06 - the area and you can edit it but if you
124:08 - hold the ALT key you can activate the
124:10 - button in controls like this so you
124:12 - won't need to preview the app and can
124:13 - edit it while testing it
124:16 - so on the left here shows a tree view of
124:18 - all our items
124:20 - and as you notice that with every item
124:22 - that I'm selecting the things on the
124:24 - working canvas are being selected as
124:25 - well
124:27 - you can see that things like next Arrow
124:29 - one subtitle one search icon 1 and so on
124:32 - are correspond to in the working canvas
124:39 - so let's take a look at something like
124:41 - the subtitle one here
124:43 - on the right hand side it shows all the
124:45 - properties that we can edit for the
124:47 - specific item that we've selected
124:49 - for example I can change the font weight
124:51 - to bold which should reflect on the app
124:53 - right away
125:01 - I can change the text to something else
125:03 - like Ariel
125:08 - I can change the font color to something
125:10 - like blue
125:12 - or we can change it to something like
125:13 - orange
125:18 - but let's leave it the way it originally
125:20 - was for now
125:23 - so as you can see on the left in the
125:25 - tree view this app is broken down into
125:27 - three screens
125:28 - there is the browse screen which is the
125:30 - main screen you see with the list of
125:31 - items
125:33 - there is the detail screen which
125:35 - displays the details of each item
125:38 - and there's the edit screen which allows
125:40 - you to edit the fields on a specific
125:42 - item
125:44 - and each one of these screens has its
125:46 - own layout that is made up of buttons
125:47 - forms functions items and such for that
125:50 - specific screen for the user to interact
125:52 - with
125:56 - some of these buttons may have functions
125:58 - as you can see on the function bar it
126:00 - shows new form edit Form 1 and it
126:02 - navigates to edit screen one but since
126:05 - it's a fundamental course you won't need
126:06 - to know each and every function and how
126:08 - to use them at a high level
126:10 - so we can do some small changes to this
126:13 - such as adding a space to the flooring
126:14 - estimates title to make it more legible
126:18 - remember that this only applies to the
126:20 - browse screen so we'll have to change
126:22 - the for estimate title for the detail
126:23 - and edit screen as well
126:27 - you can insert all kinds of items and
126:29 - controls such as text labels edit forms
126:32 - buttons and many more
126:35 - so overall there are many ways to
126:37 - customize and design the way your canvas
126:38 - app looks using any structured data set
126:40 - you want
126:42 - you can add data integration from a
126:44 - variety of sources including Excel
126:46 - SharePoint and SQL Server
126:49 - and you can publish and share their
126:51 - canvas apps within their organization or
126:53 - even publicly
126:57 - [Music]
127:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
127:03 - and we'll be covering model driven apps
127:05 - so a model driven app is a type of app
127:07 - that is designed to present data in a
127:09 - structured and organized way using
127:11 - pre-built components and a data model
127:12 - that defines the relationships between
127:14 - different data entities
127:16 - in a model driven app the user interface
127:18 - is generated automatically based on the
127:20 - data model which allows users to
127:22 - interact with the app in a consistent
127:24 - and intuitive way model driven apps and
127:26 - power apps are typically used for
127:28 - complex scenarios where data is stored
127:30 - in multiple tables and there are complex
127:32 - relationships between them for example a
127:35 - model driven app could be used to manage
127:36 - a customer relationship management
127:38 - system where data is stored in tables
127:40 - such as contacts accounts and
127:42 - opportunities
127:43 - the app would provide pre-built
127:45 - components such as forms lists and
127:47 - charts that allow users to view create
127:49 - and edit data in a structured way one of
127:52 - the key advantages of model driven apps
127:54 - and power apps is that they provide a
127:55 - high degree of flexibility and
127:57 - customization users can modify the data
128:00 - model to add new tables or fields and
128:02 - they can customize the user interface by
128:04 - adding or removing components changing
128:06 - layouts and applying themes in summary a
128:09 - model driven app in powerapps is a
128:10 - powerful tool for building custom
128:12 - business applications that provide a
128:14 - structured and organized way to interact
128:15 - with complex data models
128:19 - [Music]
128:22 - before we go more in detail on model
128:25 - driven apps we'll go through the main
128:26 - differences between model driven apps
128:28 - and canvas apps the main difference
128:30 - between model driven apps and canvas
128:32 - apps and powerapps is the way the user
128:34 - interface is designed and how data is
128:36 - presented model driven apps have an
128:38 - automatically generated pre-built
128:40 - interface based on a data model while
128:42 - canvas apps allow users to design the
128:44 - interface from scratch using pre-built
128:46 - components and formulas model driven
128:48 - apps are best for complex data models
128:50 - with multiple tables while canvas apps
128:52 - are ideal for simpler models or highly
128:54 - customized interfaces
128:56 - here are some key differences between
128:58 - model driven apps and canvas apps and
129:00 - power apps user interface model driven
129:03 - apps have a pre-built structured user
129:05 - interface based on the data model while
129:07 - canvas apps allow users to design the
129:09 - user interface from scratch data model
129:11 - driven apps are designed to work with
129:14 - complex data models that have multiple
129:15 - tables and relationships while canvas
129:18 - apps are better suited for simpler data
129:19 - models customization canvas apps provide
129:22 - more customization options than model
129:24 - driven apps but they also require more
129:26 - design work development speed model
129:29 - driven apps can be developed more
129:31 - quickly than canvas apps because much of
129:32 - the user interface is pre-built but they
129:34 - may be less flexible in terms of design
129:37 - overall the choice between model driven
129:39 - apps and canvas apps depends on the
129:41 - specific requirements of your
129:42 - application if you need to work with a
129:45 - complex data model a model driven app
129:47 - may be the better choice well if you
129:48 - need more flexibility in terms of design
129:50 - a canvas app may be the way to go
129:53 - in canvas apps the App Maker has total
129:55 - control over the app layout with model
129:58 - driven apps much of the layout is
129:59 - determined by the components you add
130:01 - here is a table to view the differences
130:03 - between the two apps per category to
130:05 - make it more digestible it's a bit
130:07 - redundant to what we've already stated
130:08 - but it doesn't hurt to reinforce the
130:10 - information you'll need to know for the
130:12 - exam
130:13 - data platform for model driven apps its
130:16 - dataverse only whereas for canvas apps
130:18 - it's dataverse plus many others using
130:19 - connectors design experience there is no
130:22 - code component focused design for model
130:24 - driven apps but for canvas apps there is
130:27 - manipulation of control properties using
130:29 - Power FX Expressions eui control for
130:32 - model driven apps there is limited
130:33 - predominantly customization canvas apps
130:36 - have full control for model driven apps
130:39 - the app consistency is high differs
130:41 - predominantly based on the tables and
130:42 - Views chosen for canvas apps it's often
130:45 - low given the significant control the
130:46 - designers have of the user experience
130:48 - the migration between environments is
130:51 - simple for model driven apps and
130:52 - potentially complex given that the data
130:54 - sources may need to be updated for
130:56 - canvas apps speed of creation is rapid
130:58 - for model driven apps and relative to
131:00 - the complexity of the design for canvas
131:02 - apps it's automatically responsive for
131:05 - model driven apps and only responsive if
131:07 - designed in this way for canvas apps for
131:10 - model driven apps the navigation through
131:12 - relationships is automatic provided
131:14 - relationships exist and for canvas apps
131:17 - it's only where designed and applied
131:18 - using Power FX formulas accessibility
131:21 - features are built in for model driven
131:23 - apps whereas for canvas apps it's
131:25 - designed into the app create accessible
131:27 - canvas apps
131:28 - foreign
131:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
131:35 - and we'll be covering the three design
131:36 - phases of a model driven app so model
131:39 - driven apps have three design phases why
131:42 - to model your business data to Define
131:45 - your business processes three build the
131:48 - app model your business data model
131:50 - driven design uses metadata driven
131:52 - architecture so that designers can
131:54 - customize apps without writing code to
131:56 - model business data you determine what
131:58 - data the app will need and how that data
131:59 - will relate to other data metadata means
132:01 - data about data and defines the
132:03 - structure of the data stored in
132:04 - Microsoft dataverse
132:06 - you create a data model that defines the
132:08 - structure of the data that the app will
132:09 - use this includes defining entities and
132:12 - the relationships between them you can
132:13 - also Define data fields views and charts
132:17 - Define your business processes defining
132:20 - and enforcing consistent business
132:21 - processes is a key aspect of model
132:23 - driven app design consistent processes
132:26 - help ensure that your app users can
132:27 - focus on their work and not worry about
132:29 - having to remember to perform a set of
132:31 - manual steps processes can be simple or
132:33 - complex and they often change over time
132:36 - you define the business processes that
132:38 - the app will support such as workflows
132:40 - approvals and notifications
132:43 - you can use the built-in tools and power
132:45 - apps to create and manage these
132:46 - processes
132:48 - the screenshot illustrates the impact of
132:50 - having a business process flow in place
132:53 - build the app after modeling data and
132:55 - defining processes you build your app by
132:57 - selecting and setting up the components
132:59 - you need in the app designer you create
133:01 - the user interface for the app using
133:03 - pre-built components such as forms lists
133:05 - and charts the user interface is
133:07 - generated automatically based on the
133:09 - data model you created in the first
133:11 - phase you can also customize the user
133:13 - interface by adding or removing
133:15 - components changing layouts and applying
133:17 - themes
133:18 - foreign
133:22 - the next topic we'll be covering are the
133:24 - building blocks of model driven apps
133:26 - starting with data the table below shows
133:29 - the different data components that can
133:30 - make up a model driven app which can
133:32 - determine what data the app will be
133:33 - based upon it also shows what designer
133:35 - is used to create or edit the data
133:37 - component table tables or items with
133:40 - properties that you track examples
133:42 - include contacts and accounts many
133:44 - standard tables are available you can
133:46 - customize a non-system standard table
133:47 - you could also create a custom table
133:49 - from scratch column columns are
133:52 - properties that are associated with a
133:54 - table and help Define that table a
133:55 - column is defined by a data type which
133:58 - determines the type of data that can be
133:59 - entered or selected examples of data
134:01 - types include text number date and time
134:04 - currency and look up columns are
134:06 - typically used in forms views and
134:08 - searches
134:09 - relationship relationships Define how
134:11 - tables can be related to each other
134:13 - there are one and and one and then and
134:16 - relationships for example adding a
134:18 - lookup column to a table creates a new
134:20 - one and relationship between the two
134:21 - tables and lets you add that lookup
134:23 - column to a form
134:24 - choice this type of column shows a
134:27 - control that lets the user select among
134:28 - predefined options each option has a
134:31 - number value in a label Choice columns
134:33 - can require either a single value or
134:35 - multiple values
134:37 - user interface the table below shows the
134:40 - user interface components which
134:41 - determine how users will interact with
134:43 - the app and what designer is used to
134:44 - create or edit the component
134:46 - app apps determine the app fundamentals
134:49 - like components properties the client
134:51 - type and the URL sitemap a sitemap
134:54 - specifies the navigation for your app
134:56 - for it forms include a set of data entry
134:59 - columns for a given table a form can be
135:01 - used to create a new data row or edit an
135:03 - existing one view views Define how a
135:06 - list of rows for a specific table
135:07 - appears in your app a view defines the
135:10 - column shown
135:11 - Logic the logic components determine
135:13 - what business processes rules and
135:15 - automation the app will have Microsoft
135:17 - power apps makers use a designer that is
135:19 - specific to the type of process or rule
135:21 - they are needing business process flow
135:24 - business process flows walk users
135:26 - through a standard business process use
135:28 - a business process flow if you want
135:30 - everyone to handle customer service
135:31 - requests the same way or you can use a
135:33 - business process flow to require staff
135:35 - to gain approval for an invoice before
135:37 - submitting an order workflow workflows
135:40 - automate business processes without a
135:42 - user interface designers use workflows
135:44 - to initiate automation that does not
135:45 - require any user interaction actions
135:49 - actions are a type of process that lets
135:51 - you manually invoke behaviors including
135:53 - custom actions directly from a workflow
135:55 - business rule business rules apply rules
135:58 - or recommendation logic to a form to set
136:00 - field requirements hide or show Fields
136:02 - validate data and more app designers use
136:05 - a simple interface to implement and
136:06 - maintain fast changing and commonly used
136:08 - rules
136:09 - flows power automate is a cloud-based
136:12 - service that lets you create automated
136:13 - workflows between apps and services to
136:15 - get notifications sync files collect
136:18 - data and more
136:20 - visualization the visualization
136:22 - components determine what type of data
136:24 - and Reporting the app will show and have
136:26 - available in which designer is used to
136:27 - create or edit the component chart
136:30 - charts are individual graphical
136:31 - visualizations that can appear in a view
136:33 - or a form or that can be added to a
136:35 - dashboard dashboard dashboards show one
136:38 - or more graphical visualizations in one
136:40 - place that provide an overview of
136:41 - actionable business data embedded
136:44 - Microsoft power via power bi ads
136:46 - embedded power bi tiles and dashboards
136:48 - to your app power bi is a cloud-based
136:50 - service that provides business
136:51 - intelligence insight
136:53 - please
136:57 - another important aspect of a model
136:59 - driven app is the business logic model
137:02 - driven apps are created using the app
137:03 - designer users select tables dashboards
137:06 - business process flows forms and other
137:08 - components to be made available in the
137:10 - app which will then be automatically
137:12 - generated this means you will need to
137:14 - spend more time understanding what your
137:15 - user needs and how it is going to look
137:17 - business logic when incorporating
137:19 - business logic in your app there are two
137:21 - primary options available you can set
137:24 - business rules on your Microsoft
137:25 - dataverse tables or you can build
137:27 - business process flows
137:29 - with business rules you'll Define
137:31 - behaviors of the data layer business
137:33 - rules are great for setting conditions
137:34 - for when a field is required setting a
137:36 - default value or even showing or hiding
137:38 - a field based on criteria an example
137:41 - could be a table for tracking expenses
137:43 - you could have a column for type of
137:45 - travel and then build a business rule
137:46 - that dictates that if a user chooses
137:48 - automobile then the mileage field is
137:50 - required else it is optional this gives
137:52 - you the power to make sure you maintain
137:53 - data consistency in all scenarios
137:56 - and powerapps a business process flow is
137:59 - a feature that helps guide users through
138:01 - a specific process or workflow within an
138:03 - app they can be used to standardize
138:05 - processes ensure consistency and improve
138:07 - efficiency
138:08 - a business process flow consists of a
138:11 - series of stages and steps each with its
138:13 - own set of fields and actions users can
138:15 - move through the stages and steps to
138:17 - complete the process and business
138:18 - process flows can be set up to require
138:20 - certain fields or data entry before
138:22 - advancing to the next stage
138:24 - they can be associated with specific
138:26 - entities and power apps such as leads
138:28 - opportunities or cases and can be
138:30 - customized to fit the specific needs of
138:32 - the organization additionally business
138:34 - process flows can be used in conjunction
138:36 - with other features in power apps such
138:38 - as business rules to further enhance the
138:40 - user experience and streamline workflows
138:44 - [Music]
138:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
138:50 - and we'll be providing a brief overview
138:52 - of dashboards and power apps in
138:54 - powerapps a dashboard is a user
138:56 - interface that provides a summary view
138:58 - of data from various sources dashboards
139:00 - and power apps typically include
139:01 - visualizations such as charts graphs
139:04 - tables and other data driven components
139:06 - that allow users to quickly and easily
139:08 - View and analyze data in a centralized
139:10 - location
139:11 - powerapps dashboards can be customized
139:13 - to meet specific business requirements
139:15 - and can be created using various data
139:17 - sources including Microsoft dataverse
139:19 - Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint lists
139:21 - users can also create multiple
139:23 - dashboards and share them with specific
139:24 - individuals or groups within the
139:26 - organization dashboards and power apps
139:29 - are an essential component of data
139:30 - analysis and visualization providing
139:32 - users with a clear and concise view of
139:34 - key performance indicators Trends and
139:36 - other critical business metrics
139:39 - you can Implement dashboards with custom
139:41 - filters and visual Graphics to tie all
139:43 - this data together right in your app
139:44 - when creating your dashboards make sure
139:47 - they are simple for your users to
139:48 - consume without overwhelming them with
139:50 - all the data provide high-level
139:52 - snapshots of your data and allow them to
139:54 - use filters to dive deeper into the data
139:56 - if needed
139:57 - foreign
140:02 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
140:04 - and in this video we'll be going over a
140:06 - sample of a model driven app
140:08 - so the first thing you want to do is to
140:10 - go to the powerapps page which is at
140:12 - make dot powerapps.com here it provides
140:16 - you with a lot of options to build
140:17 - business apps you can start from blank
140:19 - dataverse SharePoint Excel SQL and so on
140:23 - let's start by using a template that is
140:25 - already prepared for us this will give
140:27 - us a better understanding of a model
140:28 - driven app like the structure and all
140:30 - the tables of data that are linked
140:32 - together so we'll be clicking on the
140:34 - create button on the left side panel
140:36 - scroll down and look for the templates
140:38 - as you can see we have a lot of
140:40 - templates we can choose from but let's
140:42 - take a look at Innovation Challenge
140:43 - which is labeled as a model driven app
140:45 - click on create
140:49 - now that we have it loaded we can look
140:51 - at this page in better detail so in the
140:53 - center box is the model driven app View
140:56 - on the left you can see the pages tab
140:58 - currently open you also have other tabs
141:00 - here such as navigation data and
141:02 - automation we won't have to worry too
141:04 - much about it as of now on the right
141:06 - hand side are the properties that you
141:08 - can edit or change depending on what you
141:11 - are selecting it could be the content
141:12 - type title icon ID and so on so let's
141:16 - press the play button on the top right
141:17 - to preview this model driven app
141:19 - okay so what we're currently viewing
141:22 - right now is a dashboard the use case
141:24 - we're seeing generally involves
141:25 - Gathering ideas and Concepts
141:27 - transforming them into projects and
141:29 - connecting them with larger business
141:30 - strategies and this model driven app has
141:33 - tables that are related to each other
141:34 - and we want to be able to track all of
141:36 - those things so this dashboard consists
141:39 - of visually appealing charts and lists
141:41 - of items that make it easy to see what's
141:42 - going on and this application has three
141:45 - tables in it we have challenges ideas
141:47 - and team projects
141:49 - so if we take a look at challenges this
141:51 - will show us a view of tables consisting
141:53 - of the name number of ideas launch date
141:55 - accept new ideas and so on we can sort
141:58 - however we like or filter by using more
142:00 - advanced features we can also edit the
142:03 - information on the tables if we wish to
142:05 - so if we were to double click into one
142:07 - of these challenges such as the
142:09 - connected operations at the top here we
142:11 - have a business process flow and this
142:13 - guides the user across the stages and
142:15 - steps of an end-to-end process that
142:17 - you've made in your business that you
142:18 - want to track manage and report on so as
142:22 - you can see we have lots of different
142:23 - fields of information such as the
142:25 - description and order we have a drag and
142:27 - drop with multiple different boxes you
142:29 - can check like email teams and phone
142:32 - we have a list of stakeholders at other
142:34 - records so one challenge may be linked
142:36 - to many contributed ideas and so on
142:39 - I'm able to click on one of those ideas
142:41 - and see something similar for example if
142:43 - I click on the fleet automation idea you
142:46 - can see another business process flow at
142:48 - the top here
142:49 - you can see the visibility of that
142:51 - parent challenge record showing through
142:52 - with read-only Fields here you can see
142:55 - the investment required of fifty
142:56 - thousand dollars the time to Roi of 12
142:59 - months status reason is active the idea
143:01 - score is 9 and the risk score is five
143:04 - then the other thing we can do with the
143:06 - business process flow is approve the
143:08 - project stages manually and proceed to
143:10 - the next stage however they must meet
143:12 - the set of requirements and if we look
143:14 - at the team projects tab we will see the
143:16 - list of active team projects here we see
143:18 - the fleet automation that we were just
143:20 - on listing all the relevant information
143:22 - on that so you can sort of see how the
143:25 - tables and data are linked together
143:26 - through many relationships and how it
143:28 - can be sorted and transformed into a
143:30 - dashboard as mentioned before this
143:32 - dashboard is built using these three
143:33 - tables challenges ideas and team
143:36 - projects which is part of the Innovation
143:37 - Challenge model driven app
143:40 - thank you
143:44 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
143:46 - and in this video we'll be covering how
143:48 - to create a basic model driven app or
143:50 - specifically a simplified version of The
143:53 - Innovation Challenge model driven app we
143:54 - showed earlier so as we've mentioned
143:57 - before model driven apps are built using
143:59 - Microsoft dataverse and if we click on
144:01 - tables you will see a list of tables
144:03 - ready for you to use for common
144:05 - activities or scenarios the most common
144:07 - data tables user account and contacts
144:10 - because when you are doing anything that
144:11 - involves customers these will most
144:13 - likely come into play you can choose to
144:15 - use them or not but you'll see that
144:17 - they're comprehensive you can add to
144:19 - them or you can edit them in your app so
144:20 - you've got that starting point so let's
144:23 - click on Solutions
144:24 - and click on Innovation Challenge
144:27 - as you can see our Innovation Challenge
144:30 - currently has no objects so we'll need
144:32 - to create some if we recall the
144:34 - Innovation Challenge at three tables
144:36 - challenge ideas and team projects we'll
144:39 - only be creating the challenge and ideas
144:40 - tables for this simplified version let's
144:43 - click on the new button then towards
144:45 - table
144:46 - so for the display name this will be
144:49 - challenge we can enable attachments if
144:51 - we want click on Advanced options and
144:54 - here we have many options and boxes we
144:56 - can select such as track changes setting
144:58 - up SharePoint document management and so
145:00 - on but what we want to select is the
145:02 - create new activity this will create a
145:04 - timeline that's going to be in the
145:05 - middle now that we have a table created
145:08 - we're going to need to create some of
145:09 - the columns that were in The Innovation
145:10 - Challenge app so let's click on columns
145:13 - under the schema box as you can see
145:15 - there's already a list of columns in the
145:17 - powerapps environment for common use
145:19 - cases such as created by created on
145:21 - Modified by owner and so on you can set
145:24 - up all kinds of ownership and security
145:26 - and permissions which allows you to
145:28 - control that at a very granular level if
145:30 - we recall from The Innovation Challenge
145:32 - app edit columns like description
145:33 - duration accept new ideas until and
145:36 - communicate via these aren't included in
145:38 - the common columns that powerapps has
145:40 - provided so we'll need to create them
145:42 - and customize them similarly to the app
145:44 - click on new column give the display
145:47 - name is description
145:49 - the data type will be text and we want
145:51 - the multiple lines of text to be rich
145:53 - text
145:55 - click on Save
145:58 - we'll now need to create the accept new
145:59 - ideas until column so click on new
146:01 - column again
146:03 - the display name is accept new ideas
146:05 - until
146:06 - use the data type drop down menu to
146:09 - select date and time and we'll select
146:10 - date only
146:13 - then click on save it
146:16 - the next column We'll add is the
146:17 - duration column so click on new column
146:21 - the display name is duration weeks and
146:23 - brackets and we want the data type to be
146:25 - number and select whole number
146:28 - click on Save
146:31 - click on new column again
146:33 - this column is the communicate via
146:35 - column
146:36 - the data type will be choice
146:39 - and we want to choose the selecting
146:41 - multiple choices as a loud checkbox
146:44 - and on the bottom we want to select new
146:46 - choice
146:47 - the display name will be communication
146:49 - here we'll be making the three choices
146:51 - the first one is email click on new
146:54 - Choice label the second choices teams
146:56 - then the last label is phone we can add
146:59 - color to the boxes to make them a bit
147:01 - more visually appealing and easier to
147:03 - distinguish by selecting the Box on the
147:04 - left
147:07 - after that's done click on Save
147:09 - next we have to sync this Choice with
147:12 - the communication choice that we just
147:13 - created so search for that and select
147:16 - communication
147:17 - save that as well
147:19 - okay now let's create the ideas table
147:22 - click on new click on table
147:26 - the display name is idea and we also
147:29 - want to have the same features as the
147:30 - first table so we'll click on the
147:32 - creating a new activity checkbox so we
147:34 - can have that timeline of activities in
147:36 - it
147:38 - let's add a column to the idea table
147:40 - called investment required so same
147:42 - process click on new then click on
147:45 - column
147:46 - the display name is investment required
147:49 - for the data type it will be currency
147:52 - click save
147:54 - you can make the app as complex as you
147:56 - want by adding it as many tables and
147:58 - different things to it so the next thing
148:00 - we're going to do is create something
148:01 - called a lookup column for the idea
148:03 - table this links these two together from
148:06 - the idea table back to the originating
148:07 - challenge table
148:09 - so we'll click on new then select column
148:12 - we'll name this origin challenge
148:15 - the data type will be lookup
148:19 - and the related table will be challenge
148:25 - click on Save
148:27 - so if we click on relationships from the
148:30 - schema box
148:31 - we should be able to see the origin
148:33 - challenge that we created between the
148:34 - two tables The Challenge and idea tables
148:37 - are linked together through their
148:38 - relationships you can also create
148:40 - relationships here on the top left such
148:42 - as many to one one to many and many to
148:44 - many a lot of the work is already done
148:46 - for you with the intersecting tables
148:48 - behind the scenes so you won't have to
148:50 - worry too much about that the next
148:52 - component we want to look at is views
148:54 - so click on views in the idea table
148:57 - then click on active ideas
149:00 - this is where you build your app
149:01 - component you get to choose the columns
149:04 - you want and do the filtering process
149:05 - this is a drag and drop interface so you
149:08 - can drag in the columns such as the
149:10 - investment required column we just
149:11 - created and we can add in the origin
149:14 - challenge into the view
149:16 - organize the columns and resize to your
149:18 - fitting
149:20 - we can also add and edit filters and
149:23 - sorting orders so that it comes up
149:24 - filtered by certain things you might
149:26 - want to Only See
149:27 - next click on Save is then click on Save
149:31 - and click back to return to the previous
149:33 - screen the next thing we'll be creating
149:35 - is called a form
149:37 - so you want to click on the challenges
149:39 - table and click on forms
149:41 - then you want to click on information
149:43 - the form type is main should be fine
149:45 - this is pretty much the skeleton and
149:48 - structure of the table where you'll be
149:49 - able to enter in information and create
149:51 - challenges so in here you're able to add
149:54 - different kinds of columns and headings
149:55 - and things on the page on the bottom
149:57 - right let's click on layout and change
149:59 - it to three columns wide similarly to
150:01 - the original app you can have one two or
150:04 - three columns next let's track some of
150:06 - the columns that we made that were for
150:07 - the Innovation Challenge app accept new
150:10 - ideas until can be placed on the top
150:12 - right
150:14 - communicate via can be placed below the
150:16 - owner
150:19 - the description Rich text box can be
150:21 - placed between the name and owner we can
150:23 - place the duration on the top right as
150:25 - well
150:27 - let's click on the components
150:30 - we'll be adding a timeline in the column
150:32 - here
150:34 - and we'll be creating something called
150:36 - the subgrid so we'll need to scroll
150:38 - through and select the ideas table for
150:40 - this and then the default view of active
150:42 - ideas is already set click on done move
150:45 - it over to the right column
150:48 - so let's rename these labels because new
150:50 - SG control with these numbers isn't very
150:52 - helpful we'll name the separate as ideas
150:54 - and we'll give the column label section
150:57 - the contributing ideas we can rename the
150:59 - middle column section to something like
151:01 - events you can customize it to however
151:03 - you're liking there are many features
151:05 - and components you can add to it so this
151:08 - should be similar enough to The
151:09 - Innovation Challenge app so we'll click
151:11 - on save a copy then click save it
151:14 - next we'll return to the innovation app
151:16 - page
151:19 - this time we'll be creating a business
151:21 - process flow which was the bar at the
151:23 - top that takes you from the end to end
151:24 - of the stages and steps of the process
151:27 - so click on new drop down menu to
151:29 - automation then process and click on
151:31 - business process flow
151:33 - we'll need to provide a name for it so
151:35 - challenge process seems fine we'll need
151:38 - to select which table it's related to so
151:40 - we're using the challenge table click on
151:42 - create
151:44 - on the top left we'll need to add more
151:46 - stages to the business process flow The
151:49 - Innovation Challenge app had four stages
151:51 - so we'll need to create three more
151:52 - stages you can create as many as you
151:55 - want but we'll keep it similar to the
151:56 - original let's give the stages a name
151:58 - just like the business process flow in
152:00 - the innovation app
152:01 - so the first stage is set up
152:05 - the second stage is track
152:08 - the third stage is Select and execute
152:12 - and the fourth stage is close in award
152:16 - in these stages we'll need to provide a
152:19 - data step for each one of them so to
152:21 - keep things simple we'll give duration
152:23 - in weeks for the data fields in all the
152:24 - stages if you don't have the data steps
152:27 - set up you won't be able to activate the
152:29 - business process flow
152:31 - you can also add conditions and more
152:33 - complex features but we'll keep it
152:34 - simple in this app
152:37 - after adding the data steps click on
152:39 - Saved
152:41 - then you can click on activate
152:45 - okay so the next step is to create the
152:47 - model driven app so click on new drop
152:49 - down menu to app then click on model
152:51 - driven app we'll give the model driven
152:54 - app a name so Innovation Challenge app
152:56 - is fine click on creative
152:59 - next we'll need to add a page so click
153:02 - on ADD page then choose the dataverse
153:04 - table then click next
153:06 - we'll be adding in the challenge and
153:08 - idea table that we created into our
153:10 - model driven app so click on ADD page
153:13 - again dataverse table then click on next
153:16 - find the idea table and click add
153:19 - we also want to rename the group one on
153:21 - our app so let's click on the navigation
153:24 - tab click on Group 1 and rename to
153:26 - something appropriate for the app like
153:28 - innovation
153:32 - next we'll need to click on the
153:34 - automation tab on the left we'll need to
153:36 - add our business process flow to the app
153:38 - so we'll click on challenge process
153:41 - after that click on Save then click on
153:44 - publish
153:47 - after that's done we'll go back to the
153:49 - Innovation Challenge app screen and at
153:51 - the top we'll click on publish all
153:53 - customizations
153:56 - once you see the publish all
153:58 - customization succeeded notification you
154:00 - can navigate back to the apps tab
154:04 - here you should see the Innovation
154:05 - Challenge app that you have created and
154:07 - customized
154:08 - so click on that
154:11 - we'll need to enter in the challenges
154:13 - that were in the original Innovation
154:14 - Challenge app so click on new here we
154:18 - can see the form that we created in this
154:20 - same structure we have the business
154:22 - process flow the name description odor
154:24 - communicate via and so on just like the
154:27 - original so let's enter in some of the
154:29 - information the name is connected
154:31 - operations we'll give that a description
154:34 - and fill in all the other stuff after
154:37 - we've finished entering the information
154:38 - in and selecting the things we want we
154:41 - can click on Save in the top
154:44 - and once we go back we can see that a
154:46 - challenge has been added to the active
154:48 - challenges list we can choose to add
154:50 - more challenges and ideas to the model
154:52 - driven app to make it similar to the
154:53 - original app
154:55 - so as we mentioned earlier this is a
154:58 - simplified version of The Innovation
154:59 - Challenge app
155:01 - you can play around with the tables the
155:03 - forms views business process flows and
155:05 - create what you want to learn more
155:11 - [Music]
155:14 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
155:17 - and we'll be covering power automate in
155:19 - Greater detail so do you regularly
155:21 - download email attachments before
155:22 - uploading them to the database does the
155:25 - process of authorizing a new purchase
155:26 - order involve retrieving a form from a
155:28 - physical location for signatures do you
155:31 - have to manually visit a website daily
155:32 - locate the daily numbers and then
155:34 - transfer them to another system power
155:36 - automate is a solution that can help
155:38 - with these and other similar scenarios
155:40 - it is designed to enable computers to
155:42 - manage repetitive tasks with power
155:44 - automate anyone familiar with the
155:46 - business process can establish a
155:48 - repeatable sequence that executes the
155:49 - process when triggered common scenarios
155:52 - and capabilities of power automate
155:54 - automating repetitive tasks like
155:56 - transferring data between systems
155:58 - dieting a user through a multi-stage
156:00 - process connecting to external data
156:03 - sources using various connectors or an
156:05 - API automating desktop based and website
156:07 - processes with robotic process
156:09 - automation capabilities
156:12 - access to data is an important aspect of
156:14 - app development and power automate
156:16 - provides over 600 connectors to connect
156:18 - to data and services on the web or on
156:20 - premises some common data sources
156:22 - included Microsoft dataverse Salesforce
156:26 - Dynamics 365 Google Drive Office 365.
156:32 - Microsoft Power Platform easily supports
156:34 - multiple data connections allowing you
156:36 - to bring data together from many
156:37 - platforms into a single automation
156:40 - additionally power automate enables
156:42 - users to create custom connectors using
156:44 - a Swagger file to connect to any data
156:46 - source that is not covered by the
156:47 - existing connectors
156:49 - so those are the main values of using
156:51 - power automate
156:53 - [Music]
156:57 - there are several types of flows you can
156:59 - create with power automate power
157:01 - automate works by creating flows of
157:03 - which there are three main types
157:04 - cloudflows business process flows and
157:07 - desktop flows
157:08 - cloudflows these flows are created with
157:10 - a trigger in one or more actions and
157:12 - there are many triggers and actions
157:14 - available through connectors such as
157:15 - receiving an email or a social media
157:17 - mentioned
157:18 - they are categorized as my flows or team
157:21 - flows based on ownership with my flows
157:23 - being owned solely by the Creator and
157:24 - team flows having multiple odors
157:26 - create a cloud flow to automate a task
157:28 - that can be triggered automatically
157:30 - immediately or on a schedule
157:32 - automated flows these flows are
157:34 - triggered automatically when a specific
157:36 - event occurs in a connected application
157:37 - or service such as arrival of an email
157:39 - from a specific person or a mention of
157:41 - your company in social media
157:43 - instant flows these flows can be
157:45 - triggered manually by the user through
157:47 - the power automate mobile app the web
157:49 - interface or other methods for example
157:51 - instantly send a reminder to the team
157:53 - with a push of a button from your mobile
157:54 - device
157:56 - scheduled flows these flows run on a
157:58 - regular schedule or at specific times
158:00 - such as daily data upload to SharePoint
158:01 - or a database
158:04 - business process flows these flows are
158:07 - built to augment the experience when
158:08 - using model driven apps in Microsoft
158:10 - dataverse use these to create a guided
158:13 - experience in your model driven apps
158:14 - desktop flows these robotic process
158:18 - automation flows allow you to record
158:19 - yourself performing actions on your
158:21 - desktop or within a web browser you can
158:24 - then trigger a flow to perform that
158:25 - process for you you can also pass data
158:28 - integrate data out of the process
158:29 - letting you automate even manual
158:31 - business processes so these are the
158:34 - types of flows in power automate
158:37 - [Music]
158:40 - the next topic we'll be covering in
158:43 - power automate or cloudflow templates so
158:45 - a cloud flow template is a pre-built
158:47 - workflow that automates a specific
158:49 - business process or task in power
158:51 - automate these templates are designed to
158:53 - be easily customized and deployed
158:55 - allowing users to quickly create and
158:57 - share automated workflows that meet
158:58 - their specific needs cloudflow templates
159:01 - are available for a wide range of use
159:03 - cases from simple data transfers between
159:05 - applications to complex business
159:07 - processes involving multiple steps and
159:09 - approvals users can browse and search
159:11 - for templates in the power automate
159:13 - interface or on the Microsoft Power
159:15 - Platform website and can also create
159:17 - their own templates to share with others
159:20 - you can choose from a collection of
159:21 - templates to find the one that best
159:23 - matches your company's scenario search
159:25 - all templates or Browse by category to
159:27 - find your scenario and then follow the
159:29 - steps in the template to create a cloud
159:31 - flow from the template
159:33 - some common use cases for cloud flow
159:35 - templates and power automate include
159:37 - wide approval workflows templates can be
159:40 - used to create automated approval
159:41 - workflows for documents contracts and
159:44 - other types of requests for example a
159:46 - template could be created that
159:47 - automatically sends a document to a
159:49 - manager for approval when it is uploaded
159:51 - to a specific folder
159:52 - two social media monitoring templates
159:55 - can be used to monitor social media
159:57 - platforms for mentions of a company
159:58 - product or brand this can help
160:00 - businesses stay up to date with customer
160:02 - feedback and respond quickly to any
160:04 - issues
160:05 - three data integration templates can be
160:08 - used to automate the integration of data
160:10 - from different sources for example a
160:12 - template could be created that
160:13 - automatically pulls customer data from a
160:15 - CRM system and adds it to a marketing
160:17 - automation platform
160:19 - for a vet management templates can be
160:22 - used to automate the management of
160:23 - events such as sending invitations
160:25 - tracking RSVPs and sending reminders
160:28 - five document automation templates can
160:31 - be used to automate the creation of
160:33 - documents such as contracts invoices and
160:35 - reports this can help businesses save
160:37 - time and reduce errors
160:39 - overall Cloud flow templates are a
160:42 - powerful tool that can be used to
160:43 - automate a wide range of business
160:44 - processes improve efficiency and reduce
160:47 - errors
160:49 - [Music]
160:52 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
160:55 - and the next topic we'll be covering are
160:57 - the Microsoft power automate Concepts
160:59 - starting with actions and triggers power
161:01 - automate cloudflows use connector
161:03 - triggers and actions to automate tasks
161:05 - every flow has two main parts a trigger
161:08 - and what are more actions
161:09 - a trigger is an event that starts the
161:11 - workflow such as a new email arriving in
161:13 - your inbox a file being added to a
161:15 - folder or a new record Being created in
161:17 - a database triggers are used to initiate
161:19 - the workflow and determine when it
161:21 - should run
161:22 - an action is a specific task that is
161:24 - performed as part of the workflow such
161:26 - as sending an email creating a new item
161:28 - in a list or updating a record in a
161:30 - database actions are used to automate
161:32 - tasks and perform specific functions
161:34 - based on the trigger
161:35 - connectors are the bridge between the
161:37 - triggers and actions allowing them to
161:39 - communicate with other services and
161:40 - applications
161:42 - by using the appropriate connectors
161:44 - users can create powerful and complex
161:46 - workflows that automate a wide range of
161:48 - business processes
161:49 - connector triggers and actions are the
161:51 - building blocks of power automate Cloud
161:53 - flows allowing users to easily automate
161:55 - tasks and streamline their workflows
161:59 - some examples of types of actions you
162:01 - can have in a flow include
162:03 - Loops runs in action until conditions
162:05 - are met to move to the next step of the
162:07 - flow
162:08 - switch identifies a single case to
162:10 - execute based on the evaluation of input
162:13 - due until executes a block of actions
162:15 - until a specified condition evaluates to
162:17 - true
162:18 - apply to each executes a block of
162:20 - actions for each item in the input array
162:23 - Expressions underlying definition that
162:25 - describes the actual logic that runs in
162:27 - your flow that can be manually written
162:29 - you can also perform data operations in
162:32 - your flow such as compose create CSV
162:34 - table join or select these Concepts will
162:37 - come into play later when you build your
162:39 - own flows from scratch
162:42 - [Music]
162:45 - the next power automate concept we'll be
162:48 - covering in Greater detail or loops
162:50 - a loop in power automate is a control
162:52 - structure that allows you to repeat a
162:54 - set of actions for each item in a
162:56 - collection or until a specific condition
162:57 - is met Loops are useful for automating
163:00 - tasks that involve processing a large
163:02 - number of items or performing a set of
163:04 - actions repeatedly until a specific
163:06 - outcome is achieved
163:07 - the idea behind a loop is to make a
163:09 - desktop flow repeat one or more actions
163:11 - multiple times power automate implements
163:14 - the simplest type of loops with the loop
163:15 - action this Loop repeats the actions
163:18 - between the loop and end actions for a
163:20 - set number of times a loop index
163:22 - variable is created automatically to
163:24 - track the current iterations number
163:27 - there are four types of Loops available
163:29 - in power automate
163:30 - apply to each Loop this Loop allows you
163:33 - to process each item in a collection one
163:34 - at a time it is useful for automating
163:36 - tasks that involve processing a large
163:38 - number of items such as sending an email
163:40 - for each row in a SharePoint list
163:43 - do until Loop this Loop allows you to
163:45 - repeat a set of actions until a specific
163:47 - condition is met it is useful for
163:49 - automating tasks that require a specific
163:51 - outcome such as waiting until a file is
163:53 - available in a cloud storage service
163:54 - before continuing with other actions
163:57 - do while loop this Loop allows you to
163:59 - repeat a set of actions while a specific
164:01 - condition is true it is useful for
164:03 - automating tasks that involve checking
164:05 - for new data such as waiting for new
164:06 - emails to arrive in a mailbox
164:09 - for each Loop this Loop allows you to
164:11 - process each item in a collection based
164:12 - on a specific index or value it is
164:15 - useful for automating tasks that involve
164:17 - working with lists or tables such as
164:18 - updating records in a database
164:21 - these Loops are flexible and powerful
164:22 - and they can be combined with other
164:24 - actions and conditions to create complex
164:26 - workflows
164:27 - by using Loops you can automate
164:29 - repetitive tasks reduce errors and
164:31 - improve your productivity
164:35 - [Music]
164:38 - the next power automate concept we'll be
164:41 - covering is a switch
164:42 - in power automate a switch is a control
164:45 - statement that allows you to perform
164:46 - different actions based on the value of
164:48 - a specified input the input could be a
164:50 - string number or Boolean value
164:53 - the switch statement evaluates the input
164:55 - and Compares it to a set of defined
164:56 - cases if the input matches one of the
164:58 - cases the corresponding action is
165:00 - executed if there is no match a default
165:03 - action can be executed
165:04 - here is a simplified example suppose you
165:07 - want to automate an approval process
165:09 - based on the amount of a purchase
165:10 - request you could use a switch statement
165:12 - to check the value of the purchase
165:13 - request and perform different actions
165:15 - based on the amount for example if the
165:18 - purchase request is less than one
165:19 - hundred dollars send an approval email
165:21 - to the manager if the purchase request
165:23 - is between one hundred dollars and one
165:25 - thousand dollars send an approval email
165:27 - to the department head if the purchase
165:29 - request is more than one thousand
165:31 - dollars send an approval email to the
165:33 - CEO
165:34 - here is a simple visual of a switch
165:36 - layout
165:37 - so it identifies a single case to
165:39 - execute based on the evaluation of
165:41 - switch input you have a value that's
165:43 - passed through in case that checks to
165:45 - see if it matches if the case does match
165:48 - those actions are run however if there
165:50 - are no cases that match then the default
165:52 - cases run by using a switch statement
165:55 - you can simplify your workflow and
165:57 - reduce the amount of branching logic you
165:58 - need to write you can also easily add
166:00 - new cases as your business requirements
166:02 - change
166:05 - thank you
166:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
166:11 - and the next topic we'll be going
166:12 - through are conditions in power automate
166:15 - a condition is a control statement that
166:17 - allows you to test whether a specific
166:19 - condition is true or false and execute
166:21 - different actions depending on the
166:22 - result
166:23 - conditions are used to make decisions in
166:25 - your workflow based on the data that is
166:27 - being processed for example you may have
166:29 - a condition in your workflow that checks
166:31 - whether the value of a field in a
166:33 - SharePoint list is equal to a specific
166:34 - value if the condition is true the
166:37 - workflow might continue to The Next Step
166:38 - such as sending an email or updating
166:40 - another field in the list if the
166:43 - condition is false the workflow might
166:44 - take a different action such as
166:46 - terminating the workflow or notifying a
166:48 - user of the error
166:49 - power automate supports a variety of
166:52 - different conditions such as equals
166:54 - greater than less than contains starts
166:56 - with ends with and more you can also
166:58 - combine conditions using logical
166:59 - operators such as and or and not to
167:01 - create more complex conditions to use a
167:04 - condition in your workflow you typically
167:06 - add a condition action to your workflow
167:08 - specify the condition you want to
167:09 - evaluate and then specify the actions
167:11 - you want to take based on whether the
167:13 - condition is true or false using
167:15 - conditions in power automate allows you
167:17 - to create more intelligent and flexible
167:19 - workflows that can make decisions based
167:21 - on the data being processed and take
167:22 - appropriate actions based on those
167:24 - decisions
167:26 - foreign
167:30 - automate an expression is a Formula or a
167:33 - string of code that performs a specific
167:34 - operation or manipulation on data they
167:37 - are used to perform calculations
167:39 - manipulate text and evaluate conditions
167:41 - among other things
167:43 - Expressions can be used in various
167:45 - places within power automate such as
167:47 - within actions conditions or dynamic
167:49 - content
167:50 - for example you can use an expression to
167:53 - calculate a date based on the current
167:54 - date extract the substring from a text
167:56 - string or evaluate the result of a
167:58 - condition
168:00 - expressions in power automate uses
168:02 - syntax similar to that used in
168:03 - programming languages with functions
168:05 - operators and variables power automate
168:08 - provides a rich set of built-in
168:09 - functions that you can use in your
168:11 - Expressions such as string manipulation
168:12 - functions date and time functions and
168:15 - mathematical functions
168:17 - in addition to the built-in functions
168:19 - you can also create custom Expressions
168:20 - by combining multiple functions and
168:22 - operators to perform more complex
168:24 - operations expressions in power automate
168:26 - also support Dynamic content which
168:28 - allows you to reference data from
168:30 - previous steps in your workflow
168:32 - using expressions in power automate
168:34 - allows you to perform complex operations
168:36 - on your data and automate your workflows
168:38 - more efficiently by leveraging the power
168:40 - of Expressions you can create more
168:41 - flexible and robust workflows that meet
168:43 - your specific business requirements
168:46 - here are some examples of how
168:48 - Expressions can be used in power
168:50 - automate Dynamic email subject you can
168:53 - use Expressions to create a dynamic
168:54 - email subject line that includes data
168:56 - from your workflow for example you could
168:58 - include the name of the customer or the
169:00 - ID of the record that triggered the
169:01 - workflow
169:03 - date and time calculations you can use
169:05 - Expressions to perform calculations on
169:07 - dates and times such as adding or
169:09 - subtracting days or hours from a date
169:10 - this can be useful in scheduling
169:12 - workflows or setting reminders
169:15 - conditional actions you can use
169:17 - expressions and conditional actions to
169:19 - evaluate data and make decisions based
169:21 - on that data for example you could check
169:23 - if a value is greater than a certain
169:24 - threshold or if a string contains a
169:26 - specific word
169:28 - data Transformations you can use
169:30 - Expressions to transform data from one
169:32 - format to another for example you could
169:34 - convert a string to a number or a date
169:35 - to a string
169:37 - array manipulations you can use
169:39 - Expressions to manipulate arrays of data
169:41 - such as filtering sorting or joining
169:43 - arrays
169:44 - data validation you can use Expressions
169:46 - to validate Data before performing an
169:48 - action for example you could check if a
169:51 - field is blank or if a value is within a
169:52 - certain range
169:55 - foreign
169:59 - [Music]
170:01 - automate and approval is a type of
170:03 - action that allows you to send a request
170:04 - for approval to one or more individuals
170:06 - the approval action can be used to
170:08 - automate the approval process for
170:10 - various tasks such as expense reports
170:12 - time off requests or document approvals
170:15 - when an approval action is triggered a
170:17 - request is sent to the designated
170:19 - approver with the relevant information
170:20 - and options for approving or rejecting
170:22 - the request
170:24 - approvers can review the request and
170:26 - provide comments if necessary before
170:28 - making a decision once a decision is
170:30 - made the workflow can proceed to the
170:31 - next action based on the approver's
170:33 - response
170:34 - the approval action in power automate
170:37 - provides several customization options
170:38 - such as setting approval conditions
170:40 - adding custom messages or attachments
170:42 - and specifying escalation rules
170:45 - the approval action can also be
170:47 - integrated with other services such as
170:49 - Microsoft teams or Outlook to provide a
170:51 - seamless approval process within a
170:53 - familiar interface
170:55 - approvals actions actions are the events
170:58 - you want your flow to perform after the
170:59 - trigger starts the flow for example when
171:02 - a new item is added to a list created
171:04 - with Microsoft lists trigger and
171:06 - approval to have somebody review the new
171:07 - item this image shows the full list of
171:10 - approval actions that you can use in
171:12 - your flows
171:14 - there are four approval types you can
171:15 - use approve reject everyone must approve
171:19 - all approvers are given to auctions
171:21 - approve or reject a response is needed
171:23 - from each approver before the flow run
171:25 - is completed the actions that follow the
171:27 - start and wait for an approval action
171:29 - run after all the approvers respond or
171:31 - when a single rejection occurs
171:33 - approve reject first to respondent
171:36 - assigned approvers are given two options
171:38 - approve or reject approval or rejection
171:40 - by any approver completes the request
171:42 - the actions that follow the start and
171:44 - wait for an approval action run after
171:46 - any one of the approvers gives approval
171:48 - custom responses wait for all responses
171:51 - you define the options the assigned
171:53 - approvers can choose from all approvers
171:55 - must respond to complete the process
171:57 - custom responses wait for one response
172:00 - you define the options the assigned
172:02 - approvers can choose from a response
172:04 - from any approver completes the process
172:06 - so that's a general overview of
172:08 - approvals in power automate
172:11 - [Music]

182:27 - so the first thing you'll want to do is
182:29 - to go to the power automate page at
182:32 - make.powerautomate.com
182:33 - here we are currently at the home page
182:36 - and it shows you all the things you can
182:37 - do like what would you like to automate
182:39 - and you can choose specific tasks that
182:41 - you want to quickly automate with a
182:42 - pre-built template and on the left it
182:45 - shows a big list of things as well like
182:47 - approvals my flows create and so on what
182:50 - we're interested here are the templates
182:51 - because these are pre-built templates
182:53 - that make our lives a lot easier most of
182:55 - the time there will be a scenario where
182:57 - power automate already has it created
182:58 - for you so you'll just have to enter a
183:00 - few fields for the trigger and actions
183:02 - and you'll be ready to go as you can see
183:04 - there are hundreds of templates
183:06 - available for you to fit your scenario
183:07 - there are various types of templates
183:10 - such as scheduled automated and instant
183:12 - some examples could be email automation
183:14 - approvals data collection and they can
183:17 - connect to other platforms like power bi
183:19 - teams Outlook and much more for this
183:21 - example we can try something simple like
183:23 - saveoutlet.com email attachments to your
183:26 - OneDrive so whenever you receive an
183:28 - email that has attachments in your
183:29 - outlook inbox it will also save those
183:31 - attachments in your OneDrive this can be
183:33 - useful in case you may forget something
183:35 - or you want to store important files in
183:37 - your OneDrive all of this is automated
183:40 - for you once you input a few fields of
183:41 - information we could also try something
183:44 - related to Microsoft teams for example
183:47 - we can search for teams
183:49 - something like send an email when a new
183:51 - message is added in Microsoft teams
183:53 - looks very simple and straightforward so
183:55 - this will send an email to whoever you
183:57 - select when a new message is added in
183:59 - teams this can be useful for alerting
184:01 - teammates that may not have access to
184:02 - teams at the moment or sending important
184:04 - messages that may be on teams but was
184:06 - not sent to your email
184:08 - so let's take a look at that
184:10 - for this flow we'll need to connect to
184:12 - our Microsoft teams account and our
184:14 - Office 365 Outlook I already have my
184:17 - account connected so I won't need to
184:19 - connect again but if it's your first
184:21 - time you'll probably need to connect to
184:22 - these apps click on continue so on the
184:25 - top area is the trigger which is when a
184:27 - new channel message is added here you'll
184:30 - need to select the team so this could be
184:31 - your sales and marketing team your
184:33 - development team or testing team and so
184:35 - on for this example we'll choose
184:38 - development and in this section we'll
184:40 - need to select the channel That the
184:42 - message is in so we'll choose emails the
184:45 - next part is your action so this sends
184:47 - the email you'll need to select who you
184:49 - want to send the email to for this
184:52 - section I will select my own email so
184:54 - Andrew Brown I could select someone else
184:56 - from the team but for this example I'll
184:58 - just leave it for myself
185:03 - this subject is new message on Microsoft
185:05 - teams Channel this should be finances is
185:07 - unless you want to change it up a bit
185:09 - you can customize the body however you
185:11 - like you can add Dynamic content which
185:14 - allows users to pass data between
185:15 - different actions in a flow making the
185:17 - flow more flexible and efficient users
185:20 - can extract data from various sources
185:22 - and use them as input to automate
185:23 - workflows without having to hard code
185:25 - them into the flow Dynamic content can
185:27 - include information such as email
185:29 - addresses file names dates and other
185:31 - data elements that can be passed between
185:32 - different actions in a flow
185:34 - so if we were to delete the message from
185:37 - we can simply add the dynamic content
185:39 - called message from user display name we
185:42 - won't have to change anything here since
185:43 - it's a simple automated flow
185:45 - next we'll click on Save
185:48 - and that's it your flow is ready to go
185:50 - you can go test this out by sending a
185:53 - message in the team's Channel and see if
185:54 - it sends you an email
185:56 - so I'm on my teams right now currently
185:58 - at the email Channel which is where I
186:00 - set up my automated flow to be here I'll
186:02 - type in something like this is a test
186:04 - after a moment we should receive the
186:07 - email at our Outlook
186:08 - so as you can see we have received the
186:11 - automated email from teams so the
186:12 - automated flow works great
186:15 - let's try to make another flow we can
186:17 - try to not use a template this time
186:19 - instead we'll start from blank
186:23 - so this is the trigger section where
186:25 - there are many to choose from we'll try
186:27 - something simple like when a file is
186:28 - created in one drive
186:30 - so click on that and click on create
186:34 - it's a very similar process to the
186:36 - previous method but here you have a bit
186:37 - more freedom
186:39 - so for the folder we'll select
186:41 - development
186:43 - and for the action we can choose
186:45 - whatever action we want and you can have
186:46 - as many actions as you need as well
186:49 - so we'll go with something email related
186:51 - like send an email let's search for
186:54 - email in the search bar
186:56 - and let's click on send an email
186:59 - so same thing as before we'll enter in
187:01 - the fields
187:02 - I'll send this to myself so Andrew Brown
187:06 - this is where Dynamic content is very
187:08 - helpful since the fields aren't filled
187:10 - in for you when you create it from blank
187:12 - the subject can be the file name
187:17 - and the body could be the file
187:18 - identifier you can give it a title if
187:21 - you want but the ones they generate for
187:23 - you are decent enough
187:24 - after that you just press save
187:27 - and this automated flow should be ready
187:29 - to use
187:31 - so this is pretty straightforward and
187:33 - helpful with automating repetitive tasks
187:35 - and much more
187:38 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey this is Andrew Brown your favorite Cloud instructor over here on freako Camp bringing you another free Cloud certification and this time it's the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals also known as the pl 900 and the purpose of this course is to help you pass and Achieve Microsoft certification so you can go put that on your resume or your LinkedIn so you can go get that job promotion or get your first Cloud role you've been looking for the way we're going to achieve that is through lecture content HandsOn labs and also a free prax exam if you want to help support more free Cloud certification courses the best thing you can do is to purchase the additional study materials but if you don't have the money don't worry because you can definitely pass using the free content here so as always you know I've taught a lot of courses here Microsoft Azure Google terraform kubernetes you name it I've taught it for cloud over here so you are in good hands and I will see you soon soon in class ciao hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're at the start of our journey asking the most important question first which is what is the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals so the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals is an entrylevel Microsoft certification it has no prerequisites so you don't need to have any prior knowledge of the Power Platform components or the cloud to learn this specific course this course covers the following key topics understanding the business value of Power Platform and its components such as power apps power bi power automate and power virtual agents identifying the capabilities and limitations of each Power Platform component understanding the dataverse formerly common data service and how data connectors and external Services can be integrated creating basic canvas and model driven power apps creating and sharing power bi dashboards and reports creating automated workflows using power automate understanding the use cases of power virtual agents and knowledge of the basics of AI and the power platforms AI Builder capabilities so who is this certification for the certification is designed for individuals who are interested in learning how to Leverage The Power Platform to streamline business processes automate tasks and create custom Solutions you may consider this certification if you are new to Power Platform and want to learn the fundamentals and benefits of Power Platform in general you are a business user administrator developer data analyst or I.T professional you want to understand the capabilities of power platforms such as building basic business processes using power automate and power apps and gain skills and data analysis with power bi and creating chat Bots with power virtual agents or you are a senior Power Platform administrator or developer or in a related role who needs to reset or refresh their knowledge after working for multiple years so now let's take a look at the Microsoft Power Platform certification roadmap to see where we would go after the Power Platform fundamentals and what kind of roles would be associated with those certifications so at the start you get your Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals which is at the fundamental level after that we have the associate level certifications such as the Power Platform App Maker Power Platform functional consultant and Power Platform developer and we have an expert level certification called The Power Platform Solutions architect it's really up to you to choose which field you're interested in a common route could be something like if you're a developer and want to develop and secure Microsoft Power Platform Solutions you could take the Power Platform developer at the associate level and then move on to taking the Power Platform solution architect at the expert level if your interest lies more towards data analysis you could take the power bi data analyst to maximize the value of data assets with Advanced analytics and eventually take the Azure Enterprise data analyst to build Enterprise scale data analytics Solutions if you're an I.T professional or citizen developer you could take the Power Platform App Maker to simplify and automate tasks and processes then take the Power Platform functional console resultant to extend and customize Microsoft apps and services it's also common for people to take multiple of these associate level certifications it doesn't have to be just one this is to ensure they have a wide range of knowledge on all of these areas for possible career openings another route you can take is the Dynamics 365 certifications which is a suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management applications it specializes in helping businesses manage and streamline their financials operations sales marketing customer service and Human Resources procedures also if you have an interest in cloud computing you can explore options such as the Azure administrator and Azure developer from there you could take the Azure Solutions architect or devops engineer at the expert level so as you can see there are many possible paths to take and these are not all the ones available on the list ultimately it's up to you to decide what you want to specialize in keep in mind that there is no single perfect route these suggestions are simply intended to provide some guidance and help you make your own choice voice so how long is it going to take to pass this certification well it's going to really depend on your background but if we had to generalize it we can look at it as kind of a scale and so if you are at the beginner level you're looking at roughly 16 hours and when we say beginner we're saying someone that has never used Microsoft Power Platform products like power apps power automate power bi Etc someone that has never used Microsoft Azure or any cloud provider or someone that has no Tech background or experience and when we're looking at the other side of the Spectrum which is someone that is experienced we're looking at somebody who can watch this at 1.5 to 2 times speed and are able to absorb this information very quickly so they have practical working experience with the Power Platform products and is familiar with using them they have experience with Microsoft Azure or any cloud provider like Amazon web services or gcp so they can easily translate that knowledge or they have a strong background in technology where they've worked in the industry for many years and so you know their study time is going to be a lot shorter at seven hours or less and so on average most people are going to take about 12 hours to study for this course and when we talk about the kind of stuff you'll be doing it's going to be 50 lecture and labs and we call them followalongs where the idea is you follow along in your own account and that other fifty percent is the practice exams so if you look at the length of the content which is around three hours then you know you should spend as much time doing practice exams to pass and the recommended time to study is about one to two hours a day for roughly 10 days so what kind of effort are we going to have to put in to pass the exam well you have to watch the lecture videos and memorize key information you'll need to do HandsOn labs and follow along with your own account although as a fundamental certification the certification is not very heavy on HandsOn material but it will provide a much greater understanding of the topics you'll need to know for the exam and you will need paid online practice exams that simulate the real exam and the last two here were things that I used to never suggest because you could literally just watch the video shows and pass however Microsoft has recently updated this exam so it's a bit more difficult and so for these last two points you do have to do these two things for the paid online practice exams that can be hard for some people so I've made it easier for you by providing you with a full free practice exam on exampro.com pl900 and so you just have to sign up with no credit card required and you'll get a full set of questions that simulate the real exam so for the contents of the exam the certification exam consists of six domains each with its own weightage that determines the number of questions from that domain that will appear so for domain one which is business value of Microsoft Power Platform we're looking at 20 to 25 percent for domain two identify foundational components of Microsoft Power Platform we should expect 10 to 15 percent of the questions from there for domain three the capabilities of power bi were sitting at around 10 to 15 percent of the questions for domain four the capabilities of power apps we have roughly 20 to 25 percent of the questions for domain five capabilities of power automate it's about 15 to 20 percent of the questions and for domain six are the complementary Microsoft Power Platform Solutions which include power virtual agents and power Pages it's about 15 to 20 percent of the questions overall the exam is mostly well balanced and evenly distributed across all six domains so you won't be faced with an excessive amount of questions options from a particular domain that may not be your strong suit so where do you take the exam well you can take the exam at an inperson test center or online from the convenience of your own home Microsoft has partnered with the test center Network Pearson VUE and it offers in person or online and these exams are proctored meaning there is somebody watching you to ensure that you are not cheating in order to pass the exam you have to score 700 points out of the thousand and so 700 generally equates to 70 percent but it's around 70 percent because Microsoft uses scaled scoring this means that they could adjust it based on how many people are passing or failing so always aim to get higher than 70 percent the exam contains about 40 to 45 questions so you can afford to get roughly 10 to 12 questions wrong there is no penalty for wrong questions such as minus one so you should always choose an answer and the questions come in a few formats multiple choice multiple answer drag and drop and yes or no questions the duration of the exam is one hour or 60 minutes so you have a little more than one minute per question the exam time is 60 minutes but the seat time is 90 minutes see time refers to the amount of time to review instructions show the online Proctor your workspace read and accept NDA and complete the exam and provide feedback and when you do pass the exam the exam is valid forever Microsoft's fundamental level exams do not expire and you do not need to do a recertification so that about covers the introduction of the course foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going through an exam guide breakdown of the Microsoft Power Platform fundamental certification so the first thing you want to do is to go to this link here learn.microsoft.com us slash certifications slash exams slash PL 900 and once you're here you want to navigate to this link called pl900 study guide this will open an organized study guide that Microsoft has prepared for us for the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals exam we've already covered a general overview on what the exam is who the exam is for and a brief overview on the topics but we'll need to cover the exam breakdown in a bit more detail this is the section we're looking for skills measured which have been updated recently as of making this course so we already covered the six main domains describe the business value of Microsoft Power Platform identify foundational components of Microsoft Power Platform demonstrate the capabilities of power bi demonstrate the capabilities of powerapps demonstrate the capabilities of power automate and describe complementary Microsoft Power Platform Solutions so I won't be going through each point on the entire list because it's quite long but I'll point out the ones that I think you should definitely pay attention to starting off with the business value of Microsoft Power Platform Services you'll definitely need to know all of these Services listed here and their value and benefits for the extending business solutions by using Microsoft powered platform you'll just need to know the general overview of these services like Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 apps but describing how Microsoft Power Platform apps work together would be the most important one for the Power Platform Administration and governance the most important one here is would be the Power Platform security model and environments for the Microsoft dataverse it's an important one to know things such as tables columns and relationships in Microsoft dataverse you will probably see business logic and data flows in Microsoft dataverse on the exam as well as the components of a connector for power bi the two important ones here are power bi desktop and power bi service and you'll need to know dashboards workspaces reports and paginated reports you'll also need to know how to build a basic dashboard by using power bi for power apps all the sections here you'll need to know well which are the differences between canvas apps and model driven apps and their use cases and capabilities for both you'll also need to know how to build a basic canvas and model driven app for the power automate section the most important ones would be cloud and desktop flow and how power automate cloudflows use connector triggers and actions actions for power automate desktop flows is another important one and you'll need to know how to build a basic power automate flow for the complementary Microsoft Power Platform Solutions you'll mostly just need a general overview of power virtual agents and the purpose of topics entities and actions you'll also need to know the use cases and capabilities of power pages and AI Builder once again there's a lot on the list so I couldn't mention all the points so I highlighted the ones I thought were the most important but throughout the course we'll definitely cover all of the material in great detail thank you foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and I'll be giving you a walkthrough of our practice exam simulator so what we're looking at here is a free practice exam I provide for you all you have to do is sign up on exam Pro and you can redeem the free available content here you don't need a credit card at all these exam questions are up to date and closely simulates what you'll see on the exam you'll be getting a full set of 40 questions so it's a real simulation like the actual exam so I'll be clicking in here to start the exam and I'll show you what it'll look like we won't be going through the entire exam we'll only be going through a couple of questions so you can get an idea of how the exam questions are structured and the level of difficulty these questions are so the first question we have presented with here is you are working for a company that uses Dynamics 365 sales to manage their sales processes as part of improving customer experience the company wants to implement a chat bot on their web page to interact with customer questions they want to use Microsoft Power Platform to extend the capabilities of Dynamics 360 five sales which application should you use to create a chat bot and extend the capabilities of Dynamics 365 sales so we have four options to pick from and in this scenario the best choice here should be powered virtual agents so we'll choose that so the next question we have here is you work for a busy eCommerce company that has experienced significant growth in Customer Support requests to enhance the support experience for both customers and support technicians the company wants to implement a tool that enables immediate notifications when new support requests are submitted which tools should you recommend to achieve this goal in this scenario the answer should be power automate so you'll mostly be seeing multiple choice and multiple select questions but there'll also be a few true or false and drag and drop questions in there as well here's a multiple select question where you have to select two choices to get the right answer in this scenario the first two options should be correct but I don't want to spoil too much for you let's end the exam here so you can see how well you performed and to review the questions here we can see that we only answer two questions correctly out of the 40. all the practice exam questions provide an explanation on why the answer was correct and also an explanation for the wrong answers they'll also be links to the sources and documentation so you can reference the material you won't need to perform any coding and they won't ask you anything about code in this exam the length of the questions can vary some questions are short and straight to the point and in some questions you'll be given a scenario and you'll have to figure out which tool is best suited for the requirement in these practice exams I added a bit more context to it so that you're over prepared so if you do really well on these practice exams you should do well on the actual exam hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be answering the most important question what is Microsoft Power Platform well Microsoft Power Platform is a line of business intelligence app development and app connectivity software applications Microsoft Power Platform is composed of five key products power apps power automate power bi Tower virtual agents and power pages we'll be going through a brief overview of each

deliver business innovation in a reduced time scale in summary Power Platform helps organizations achieve their digital transformation goals faster more cost effectively and with greater flexibility and scalability than traditional development approaches ultimately adding significant business value hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is how Microsoft Power Platform apps work together with Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps Microsoft Power Platform in Microsoft Dynamics 365 are two different platforms but they can work together seamlessly to provide powerful Business Solutions powerapps allows users to create custom business applications with little or no code these custom apps can be used to perform various tasks such as managing data automating workflows and analyzing data power apps can also integrate with Dynamics 365 apps to enhance their capabilities Dynamics 365 apps are designed for specific business functions such as sales marketing customer service and finance these apps are built on the common data model which provides a standard and consistent way to organize and store data across different applications power apps can use the common data model as a data source allowing them to connect and integrate with Dynamics 365 apps this means that data can flow seamlessly between power apps and Dynamics 365 apps and users can work with the same data across both platforms power apps can also leverage the advanced functionality of Dynamics 365 apps such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning capabilities in summary Power Platform apps and Dynamics 365 apps can work together to provide a unified and comprehensive solution for businesses power apps can be used to extend the functionality of Dynamics 365 apps or create custom apps that integrate with Dynamics 365 data this integration between the two platforms provides a powerful solution for managing and analyzing business data Microsoft Power Platform Solutions work together with Microsoft 365 apps and services to create a unified approach to digital transformation with the integration of powerapps power automate power bi and dataverse businesses can create customized solutions that automate processes visualize data and gain insights to drive informed decisions for example a company may use power apps to create a custom form that captures customer information and then use power automate to automatically send that information to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for sales they can also use power bi to create reports that show customer Trends and behavior and use that information to make strategic decisions the integration with Microsoft 365 allows businesses to leverage existing data sources and systems to build apps and automate workflows power apps and power automate can interact with Microsoft teams SharePoint Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps enabling users to easily access data and Trigger workflows directly from their familiar interfaces additionally power bi allows businesses to visualize data from Microsoft 365 apps such as Excel SharePoint and Dynamics 365 alongside data from other sources this provides a comprehensive view of business operations and allows for better decision making overall the integration of Microsoft Power Platform with Microsoft 365 apps and services allows businesses to streamline their processes increase productivity and gain valuable insights to drive their digital transformation Journey forward foreign we've briefly gone over the main Power Platform products and their key features but we haven't really touched on how Power Platform apps can work together so the integration of Microsoft Power Platform apps is achieved through the utilization of a common data model which is a standardized and modular collection of data scheme is designed to work seamlessly together by leveraging this model various Power Platform apps such as power apps power automate and power bi can effectively collaborate and share data for example a power app can use data stored in Microsoft dataverse and power automate can automate tasks Based on data in a power app power bi can then visualize the data from both the PowerApp and power automate to provide insights for informed decision making the various Power Platform apps also offer connectors that allow for integration with other services such as Microsoft 365 apps and thirdparty applications by leveraging these connectors users can create endtoend solutions that automate complex business processes and improve overall efficiency Microsoft Power Platform has multiple apps that collaborate to offer a complete solution for users to design and handle personalized apps automate processes and analyze data power apps allows users to create custom applications with a drag and drop interface these apps can then be integrated with other Microsoft services and external data sources power automate enables users to automate repetitive tasks and workflows between various apps and services this can include automating notifications data collection approvals and much more power bi is a data visualization tool that allows users to create reports and dashboards to analyze data from multiple sources the data can come from various sources like spreadsheets databases or cloudbased Services Microsoft dataverse provides a centralized location for data storage and management allowing users to create and manage data entities and relationships between them all these apps work together seamlessly allowing users to create a customized solution that can automate their business processes manage data effectively and derive valuable insights through data analysis foreign the next topic we'll be covering is how Microsoft Power Platform works with Microsoft teams Microsoft Power Platform Works seamlessly with Microsoft teams a collaboration platform for teams to communicate and work together with Power Platform integrated into teams users can access and use powerapps power bi and power automate without leaving the team's interface for example users can create and share power apps directly Within A team's Channel or chat allowing team members to collaborate and access the app in real time similarly users can access and view power bi reports and dashboards Within A team's Channel or chat making it easier to share Data Insights and collaborate on analysis power automate can be used to create automated workflows within teams enabling users to trigger actions and send notifications in response to specific events for example a power automate flow can be created to notify A team's Channel when a new item is added to a SharePoint list or trigger a message in teams when a specific action is taken in a power app power virtual agents is a chatbot development platform within Microsoft Power Platform that can be integrated with Microsoft teams with this integration businesses can build and deploy chat Bots and teams to provide 24 7 support answer frequently asked questions and automate simple tasks overall the integration of Microsoft Power Platform with Microsoft teams provides users with a seamless and streamlined experience for collaboration and productivity hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be discussing is how Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions can consume Microsoft Azure services Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions can consume Microsoft Azure Services through their integration with Azure apis and connectors Azure provides a wide range of cloud services that can be leveraged by Power Platform apps such as Azure functions Azure cognitive services and Azure machine learning one way is through the use of azure connectors which enable Power Platform apps to access and manipulate data stored in Azure services such as Azure blob storage Azure SQL database and Azure event hubs this allows businesses to Leverage The Power of azure services within their Power Platform Solutions another way Power Platform can consume Azure Services is through the use of azure functions which can be triggered by power automate flows this enables businesses to create custom logic and Integrations that run on demand are based on specific events such as the creation of a new record in Dynamics 365 or the receipt of an email in Outlook power bi can also be used to consume Azure Services by connecting to data stored in Azure services such as Azure data like storage and visualizing that data through dashboards and reports this allows businesses to gain valuable insights from their Azure data in a userfriendly and easily digestible format power apps can consume Azure cognitive Services which includes Ai and machine learning capabilities like natural language processing speech recognition and computer vision to add intelligent features to custom applications overall the ability to consume Azure services within Power Platform Solutions provides businesses with additional capabilities and flexibility to build powerful customized solutions that meet their unique needs the Microsoft Power Platform security model is designed to ensure that data and resources within Power Platform applications are protected from unauthorized access or modification the security model of Power Platform is based on user roles permissions and data governance policies and consists of three layers tenant level environment level and data level security at the tenant level security is managed by the Microsoft 365 admin Center which allows administrators to manage user accounts access to services and other settings that impact the entire tenant at the environment level security is managed through the Power Platform admin Center which allows administrators to create and manage environments and control access to data and applications within those environments data level security is implemented using rolebased access control and Azure active directory to manage permissions and access to data within the platform this means that administrators can control access to data in actions within the Power Platform using authentication with organizational credentials ensuring that users only have access to authorized resources and data the platform also includes audit logging and Reporting capabilities which allow administrators to monitor user activity and identify potential security risks Power Platform has several builtin security features such as conditional access policies multifactor authentication and data loss prevention policies that can be configured to meet specific security and compliance requirements data governance policies can also be implemented within Power Platform to ensure that data is protected and compliant with regulatory requirements for example data loss prevention policies can be set up to prevent users from sharing sensitive information outside of the organization and conditional access policies which control access to data based on factors such as device type and location data protection is insured through encryption of data both in transit and at rest Power Platform services use industry standard encryption protocols to ensure data privacy and protection Additionally the platform is designed to comply with various Regulatory and Industry standards including gdpr HIPAA and ISO 27001 to ensure that organizations can use the platform to store and manage data in a secure and compliant manner overall the Power Platform security model is designed to ensure the protection and privacy of data while providing flexibility and ease of use to users foreign platform an environment is a designated space to manage and store an organization's business data apps chat Bots and flows it can be used as a container to separate apps with different roles security requirements or Target audiences how environments are utilized will depend on the organization's needs and the apps being built for example you can build your apps or chat bots in a single environment you can group the test in production versions of your apps or chat bots in separate environments you can create environments for specific teams or departments in your company with relevant data and apps for each audience or you might also create separate environments for different Global branches of your company in Power Platform each environment is associated with an Azure active directory tenant and is bound to a specific geographic location any resources created in an environment such as apps chat Bots connections and flows are also bound to that location each environment can have only one dataverse database which provides storage for your apps and chat Bots the apps you create in an environment can only connect to the data sources in that same environment including connections gateways flows and dataverse databases this means that an app created in what environment cannot connect to the data sources in another environment for example consider a scenario where you've created two environments named test and Dev and created a dataverse database in each of the environments if you create an app in the test environment it will only be permitted to connect to the test database it won't be able to connect to the dev database the next topic we'll be covering are environment permissions and Power Platform so there are two prebuilt roles and environments that Grant permissions environment admin and environment maker the environment admin role can perform all administrative actions on an environment such as adding or removing a user or group from either the environment admin or environment maker role provisioning a dataverse database for the environment View and manage all resources created within the environment and set data loss prevention policies after creating the database in the environment you can use the system administrator role instead of the environment admin role the environment maker role can create resources such as apps connections custom connectors gateways and flows using power automate within an environment environment makers can share the apps they create with other users or groups within the organization however users or groups with these roles are not automatically granted access to the environment's database if one exists access to the database must be granted separately there are five main types of environments in Power Platform wide in production this is the default environment and it's where you deploy your finished apps and solutions that are ready for use by end users two sandbox this is a nonproduction environment that you can use to develop and test your apps and solutions without affecting the data in your production environment three trial this is a temporary environment that you can use to evaluate Power Platform before purchasing a license the trial environment is valid for 30 days for developer this is a nonproduction environment that is designed for developers to build and test their Solutions it provides full access to All Power Platform features and capabilities and five default this environment is automatically created for each tenant when it is provisioned it cannot be deleted but it can be renamed and its settings can be customized to meet your organization's needs thank you hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is the Microsoft Power Platform admin Center and where to perform specific administrative tasks the Microsoft Power Platform admin Center is a webbased portal that allows administrators to manage and monitor their Power Platform environments including powerapps power automate power bi and dataverse you should always check for administration settings as your first step when looking to administer Microsoft dataverse settings are grouped into the following broad categories and are accessible by selecting the link on the left hand side of the portal starting with environments this section lists all instances of Microsoft dataverse data policies this section lets you set up policies to restrict which data connectors can be used with Microsoft dataverse to limit what data can flow into or out of Microsoft data versus tables and data integration this section lets you create or add predefined connections and monitor these connections between Microsoft dataverse and other data stores like Salesforce or SQL Server in the admin Center administrators can perform various administrative tasks such as manage environments create delete or manage environments and view environment details and settings manage security manage permissions for environment roles and data loss prevention policies manage data manage dataverse databases configure data policies and view data Integrations manage analytics view usage metrics monitor data flows and configure Telemetry settings manage connectors configure and manage connectors and view connector usage and Analytics manage gateways configure and manage gateways and view Gateway usage and Analytics manage custom connectors create manage and deploy custom connectors manage flows manage and view all flows in the environment age apps manage and view all apps in the environment and manage AI Builder manage and configure AI Builder models and data administrators can access the Power Platform admin Center by signing into admin.power platform.microsoft.com with their Microsoft 365 or Power Platform credentials thank you the Microsoft 365 admin Center is a webbased portal that allows administrators to manage and monitor their Microsoft 365 tenant including users groups licenses settings and security here are some examples of specific administrative tasks that can be performed in the Microsoft 365 admin Center why do user management admins can add delete and modify user accounts reset passwords and manage user roles and permissions 2. group management admins can create and manage groups assign group owners and control group settings three license management admins can purchase assign and manage licenses for Microsoft 365 apps and services for Security Management admins can set up and manage security features such as multifactor authentication conditional access and device management live settings management admins can customize various settings such as email settings SharePoint settings and team settings to meet the needs of their organization six compliance management admins can manage compliance features such as data loss prevention retention policies and ediscovery seven billing and subscriptions admins can manage billing information and payment methods view usage reports and purchase new subscriptions to access the Microsoft 365 admin Center go to admin.microsoft.com in your web browser enter your work or school account credentials and then you will be taken to the dashboard where you can perform various administrative tasks overall the Microsoft 365 admin Center provides a central location for administrators to manage and configure various Microsoft 365 services for their organization hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going through an overview of the dataverse Microsoft dataverse formerly known as common data service is a cloudbased solution that easily structures various types of data and business logic to support interconnected applications and processes in a secure and compliant manner it is a part of the Power Platform Suite of tools provided by Microsoft and is tightly integrated with other Power Platform products such as powerapps power automate and power bi dataverse allows users to store and manage data in a secure and scalable way with a flexible data model that can be customized to meet specific business needs it provides a set of tools for creating configuring and managing data entities fields and relationships and allows users to Define complex business logic using no code low code approaches such as formulas and workflows dataverse supports data integration with a wide range of external data sources including other cloudbased applications onpremises databases and various thirdparty services it also provides Advanced features such as data validation auditing and Version Control and can be used to build a variety of business applications such as CRM HR management and financial reporting among others here is an image that describes what's in the box of Microsoft dataverse breaking it down into categories such as security logic data storage integration and so on security dataverse handles authentication with Azure active directory to allow for conditional access and multifactor authentication it supports authorization down to the row and column level and provides Rich auditing capabilities logic dataverse allows you to easily apply business logic at the data level regardless of how a user is interacting with the data the same rules apply these rules could be related to duplicate detection business rules workflows or more data dataverse offers you the control to shape your data allowing you to discover model validate and report on your data this control ensures your data looks the way you want regardless of how it is used storage dataverse stores your physical data in the Azure Cloud this cloudbased storage removes the burden of worrying about where your data lives or how it scales these concerns are all handled for you integration dataverse connects in different ways to support your business needs apis webhooks Eventing and data exports give you flexibility to get data in and out a dataverse database is a single instance of Microsoft dataverse which stores data in a set of standard and custom data structures called tables a table is a logical set of rows that is used to store data rows within a table contain many columns to manage individual pieces of information about a single row you can create one or many database instances in Microsoft dataverse to host data behind your business solutions each instance of a Microsoft dataverse will start with the same set of tables to store data but you can always extend and customize the Microsoft dataverse database to meet specific business needs scalability a dataverse database supports large data sets and complex data models tables can hold millions of items and you can extend the storage in each instance of a Microsoft dataverse database to four terabytes per instance the amount of data that is available in your instance of Microsoft dataverse is based upon the number and type of licenses that are associated with it data storage is pulled between all license users so you can allocate storage as needed for each solution that you build overall Microsoft data versus a powerful and flexible platform for managing and processing data with a wide range of applications across different Industries and business domains so a common question asked is what is the difference between traditional databases versus Microsoft dataverse well traditional databases and Microsoft dataverse have several differences in terms of their architecture functionality and usage here are some key differences while the architecture traditional databases are typically relational databases that store data in tables with defined relationships between them dataverse on the other hand is a note code low code platform that uses a data model to store data in an entity attribute value format to scalability traditional databases can be scaled up or down based on demand but this usually requires a dedicated team of database administrators to manage the hardware and software and contrast dataverse is a cloudbased platform that automatically scales to meet changing demands without requiring any manual intervention three integration traditional databases require custom integration code to connect with other systems whereas dataverse integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products and services such as power apps power automate and Dynamics 365. for customization traditional databases can be customized using SQL queries and programming languages such as Java or python while dataverse provides a graphical interface that allows users to create custom entities fields and relationships without writing any code five security traditional databases typically require extensive configuration to secure data at various levels such as at the network server and database levels in contrast dataverse has builtin security features that provide granular Access Control to data at the entity and field levels in summary while traditional databases are suitable for largescale missioncritical applications that require extensive customization and management data versus design for no code low code applications that require quick and easy development integration and management of data hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering tables and columns and dataverse a table is a logical structure containing rows and columns that represents a set of data here is a screenshot of the standard contact table in various types of columns it includes types of tables the three types of tables are standard tables also known as out of the box tables come preinstalled in a dataverse environment these include tables such as account business unit contact task and user most of these standard tables can be customized to suit specific needs additionally tables that are part of a managed solution and marked as customizable will also appear as standard tables users with the necessary permissions can modify these tables if the customizable property is set to True manage tables are those that cannot be customized and are imported into the environment as part of a managed solution custom tables meanwhile our managed tables that are either imported from an unmanaged solution or are created directly within the dataverse environment these tables can be fully customized by users with the appropriate privileges columns serve as a means of storing a specific piece of information within a table row much like an Excel column columns have data types meaning that you can store data of a certain type in a column that matches that data type for example dates are stored in columns with the date data type while numbers are stored in columns with the number data type the number of columns in a table can vary significantly ranging from a few to several hundred however having too many columns could indicate a need to reevaluate how data storage is structured for the solution in Microsoft dataverse a standard set of tables is provided by default and each of these tables has a predetermined set of columns the next topic will be covering are relationships and dataverse in Microsoft dataverse relationships Define the way that different tables in the system are connected or linked together based on shared data a relationship specifies how data in one table is related to data in another table relationships are defined by creating a field in the primary table that is used to store a reference to the related table this field is called a foreign key and it contains a value that matches the primary key of a record in the related table when data is entered or updated in the system the relationships ensure that related data is updated consistently across the tables which helps to maintain the Integrity of the data within the system relationships are an essential aspect of building complex data models and dataverse that can support a variety of business scenarios they allow users to connect and organize data in meaningful ways which can help to improve efficiency accuracy and insight into business operations there are three types of relationships in dataverse why one to many this is the most common relationship type in which one record in the primary table is associated with many records in the related table for example a customer could have multiple orders in the system to many to one in this relationship type many records in the primary table are associated with a single record in the related table for example many orders could be associated with a single customer three many to many this relationship type involves many records in both the primary and related tables being associated with many records in the other table for example a customer could have multiple orders and an order could involve multiple products foreign moving on to the next component of the data Versa environments environments are used to store manage and share your organization's business data apps and flows in Microsoft Power Platform for each environment created one Microsoft dataverse databases provisioned for use solely within that environment these environments also provide the ability to manage user access security settings and Associated Storage for the database and environment is created within a specific Microsoft Azure active directory tenant and its resources can only be accessed by users within that tenant in addition each environment is bound to a geographic location such as the United States upon creating a Microsoft dataverse database within an environment the database is created within the data centers located in the environment's geographic location furthermore any items generated within the environment including connections gateways power automate workflows and others are also bound to the environment's location by establishing multiple environments you can efficiently manage solution development and data storage for instance you may set up distinct environments for development testing and production use additionally environments can be created based on specific Geographic locations for example an environment for Europe and another for Asia may be established each of these environments is associated with zero or only one instance of Microsoft dataverse foreign the next topic we'll be covering are business rules Microsoft dataverse provides a feature to Define business rules which allow you to apply and maintain business logic at the data layer rather than the app layer this means that the business rules you create in dataverse are effective regardless of where you interact with the data business rules provide a powerful way to enforce rules validate data or set values regardless of the form used for data input they can increase data accuracy simplify application development and streamline forms for users both canvas and model driven apps can use business rules with actions such as set column values clear column values validate data and show error messages model driven apps can also use business rules to show or hide columns enable or disable Collins create business recommendations based on business intelligence here is an example of a simple yet powerful use of business rules the rule is set up to make the credit limit VP approver field mandatory when the credit limit exceeds one million dollars conversely the field is optional when the credit limit is below one million dollars by applying this business rule at the data level instead of the app level you have better control of your data this can ensure your business logic is followed whether it is being accessed directly from powerapps Power automate or via an API the rule is tied to the data not the app hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering are data flows and dataverse data flows in Microsoft dataverse are a way to extract transform and load data from various sources into dataverse tables with data flows you can automate the process of importing data from different sources and transform it into a consistent format this allows you to streamline the data integration process reduce data entry errors and improve data accuracy data flows are created using power query which is a data transformation in cleansing engine that enables you to transform data from a variety of sources such as Excel SharePoint SQL server and many others you can use power query to perform operations such as filtering sorting grouping and aggregating data and then load the transform data into dataverse tables data flows also support incremental refresh which means that only the change data is loaded into the dataverse table this helps to optimize data loading performance and reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed during the ETL process once the data flow is created and scheduled it runs on a regular basis such as daily or weekly depending on your needs the transform data is loaded into the specified dataverse table and you can then use it to power your apps reports and dashboards the next topic we'll be covering are data connectors Microsoft Power Platform is a system that enables users to create comprehensive business solutions by analyzing data through Power by Building Solutions using powerapps and automating business processes through Power automate data connectors allow Microsoft Power Platform to leverage data from different sources connectors act as an interface to connect to apis enabling the underlying services to communicate with Microsoft Power Platform popular connectors include Salesforce Office 365 Twitter Dropbox SharePoint and SQL Server Microsoft Power Platform employs connectors to efficiently utilize data from multiple platforms connectors act as a link between your data source and your app or workflow allowing data to be exchanged between them by utilizing connectors you can expand your business solutions to various platforms and incorporate additional features for your users connectors allow apps to connect to apps data and devices in the cloud there are two types of data sources tabular and function based tabular data sources return data in a structured table format examples of tabular data sources include Microsoft dataverse SharePoint and SQL Server functionbased data sources use functions to interact with data sources examples of functionbased data sources include Office 365 users Azure blob storage and project online those types of data sources are commonly used to bring data across many platforms and add functionality to your Solution by connecting to these data sources Power Platform allows users to create powerful apps automate processes and analyze data from various systems and applications in one centralized location foreign now that you have gained some knowledge about data sources you are ready to learn about connectors connectors act as a link between your data source and app workflow or dashboard Microsoft Power Platform has over 600 connectors for various data sources that are categorized as standard and premium standard connectors are free and available to all users of Power Platform these connectors are developed and maintained by Microsoft and they allow users to connect to a variety of commonly used services and platforms some popular standard connectors or SharePoint Outlook and YouTube premium connectors require additional licensing for your app and or users freemium connectors are created and maintained by thirdparty vendors and offer more advanced capabilities they may have better performance more robust security features or provide additional functionality a few premium connectors or SQL Server SurveyMonkey and MailChimp connectors facilitate the exchange of data between the data source and Power Platform which can speed up the implementation of Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions one example of this is using Dynamics 365 apps such as customer service where you can create a notification for users through Power automate when certain customer types are added you can use a SharePoint document library to store files that are then used in power apps for management and distribution Microsoft also offers connectors to their Azure Services which utilize Advanced AI techniques to perform tasks like extracting text from images or recognizing faces and images additionally all Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions can be utilized in Microsoft 365 apps such as teams enabling users to run power automate from within teams although Microsoft Power Platform provides over 600 connectors users can choose to create a custom connector to expand their app's functionality by accessing either a publicly available API or a custom API they are hosting in a cloud provider like Azure API stands for application programming interface and it provides a set of functions that developers can use connectors work by exchanging data between apis and assembling functions into powerapps or power automate since these connectors are based on functions they will call specific functions in the underlying service of the API to return the corresponding data building custom connectors offers the benefit of crossplatform compatibility meaning they can be utilized in various platforms like power apps power automate and Azure logic apps creating custom connectors you can create custom connectors using three different approaches using a blank custom connector from an open API definition and from a postman collection custom connectors and Power Platform can be used in various use cases including why integrating with nonstandard data sources custom connectors can be built to integrate with nonstandard data sources that don't have prebuilt connectors available this allows businesses to bring data from these sources into the Power Platform for use in apps and workflows to customize the existing connectors custom connectors can also be built to add functionality to existing connectors such as adding custom authentication or providing additional data transformation options three automating business processes custom connectors can be used to automate complex business processes that involve multiple systems and data sources this can help streamline workflows and improve efficiency for building apps for external users custom connectors can be used to build apps for external users such as customers or partners that require access to data from proprietary systems or databases hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering are triggers and actions triggers and actions are two fundamental components of the Power Platform once you have established a data source and configured your connector there are two types of operations you can use triggers or actions triggers initiate workflows when certain conditions are met for example a trigger can be set up to automatically start a workflow when a new item is added to a SharePoint list or when a new email arrives in a specific mailbox triggers can be set up in power automate formerly known as Microsoft flow and powerapps actions are prompted by the user or trigger and allow interaction with your data source through a specific function actions are used in power automate and power apps actions can be anything from sending an email or creating a new record in a database to posting a message in a chat application in power automate and power apps users can create custom actions by building flows which are workflows that automate repetitive tasks together triggers and actions allow users to create custom workflows that automate processes and improve productivity by connecting various services and applications users can streamline workflows reduce errors and save time Power Platform provides a wide range of connectors and templates that can be used to create these workflows and users can also create custom connectors and actions to suit their specific needs foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this section we'll be going into greater detail of what power bi is at its main components let's begin with a brief overview Microsoft power bi is a collection of software Services applications and connectors that work together to transform your diverse data sources into coherent engaging visuals and interactive insights power bi enables you to connect to your data sources clean and model your data without affecting the underlying Source visualize and share what's important with anyone you choose your data could be a simple Microsoft Excel workbook a collection of cloudbased and onpremises hybrid data warehouses and many more as you can see from the image you can use many data sources such as Excel Cloud databases Microsoft Edge Microsoft Access SQL databases and many more you can use them with power bi and generate all kinds of visualizations reports dashboards Etc that will help you find business insights within your organization's data thank you the next topic we'll be discussing about are the parts of power bi so power bi is made up of several components that all function together starting with these three fundamentals first we have a Windows desktop application called Power bi desktop secondly we have an online SAS service called the power bi service and lastly we have power bi mobile apps for Windows IOS and Android devices power bi desktop power bi service and power bi mobile apps are designed to let you create share and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively now let's go over the power bi Concepts data sets reports and dashboards are the three main components of power bi they are all organized into workspaces and they are created on capacities so what are capacities capacities or a Core Power bi concept that refer to a set of resources utilized to host and deliver your power bi work capacities are either shared or dedicated by share capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers while a dedicated capacity is fully committed to a single customer dedicated capacities require a subscription by default workspaces are created on a shared capacity so that's all for the main components of power bi hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going over what workspaces in power bir so workspaces are containers for dashboards reports data sets and data flows in power bi there are two types of workspaces first we have my workspace and then we have workspaces so my workspace is the personal workspace for any power bi customer to work with your own content only you have access to your my workspace you can share dashboards and reports from your my workspace if you want to collaborate on dashboards and reports or create an app then you want to work in a workspace workspaces are used to collaborate and share content with colleagues you can add colleagues to your workspaces and collaborate on dashboards reports and data sets keep in mind that all workspace members need power bi Pro licenses workspaces are also the places where you create publish and manage apps for your organization workspaces can be thought of as staging areas and containers for the content that will make up a power bi app an app is a collection of dashboards and reports created to provide important metrics to the power bi consumers in your company apps are interactive but consumers cannot edit them app consumers and the colleagues who have access to the apps do not necessarily need Pro licenses so that's a general overview of workspaces in power bi foreign the next topic we'll be covering are data sets in power bi so a data set is a collection of data that you import or connect to Tower bi enables you to connect to import and combine many data sets in one location data sets can Source data from data flows data sets are associated with workspaces in a single data set can be part of many workspaces when you open a workspace the associated data sets are listed under the data sets tab each listed data set represents a collection of data for example a data set can contain data from an Excel workbook on OneDrive and onpremises ssas tabular data set and or a Salesforce data set there are many different data sources supported data sets added by one workspace member are available to the other workspace members with an admin member or contributor role so what are shared data sets a shared data set is a data set shared between multiple reports it's important to establish standardized data sets that serve as the one source of Truth discovering and reusing those standardized data sets is also key report creators can use optimized data sets created and shared by expert data modelers in your organization as a starting point when building Reliable Reports your organization can have consistent data for making decisions at a healthy data culture to consume these shared data sets just choose power bi data sets when creating your power bi report moving on to data set types so power bi data sets represent a source of data ready for reporting and visualization there are five different data set types and they can be created in the following ways first by connecting to an existing data model that isn't hosted in a power bi capacity second by uploading a power bi desktop file that contains the model then by uploading an Excel workbook containing one or more Excel tables in our workbook data model or uploading a CSV also known as a comma separated values file you can also use the power bi service to create a push data set and finally we use the power bi service to create a streaming or hybrid streaming data set an exception for this would be for streaming data sets the data set represents a data model which leverages the mature modeling Technologies of analysis services so that's the different kinds of data sets for power bi so the next component will be discussing are reports at Power B I report is one or more pages of visualizations such as line charts maps and tree maps visualizations are also called visuals power bi allows you to create reports from scratch import them with dashboard shared by coworkers or have it create reports when you connect to data sets like Excel power bi desktop databases and SAS apps for example power bi generates a report using the Power view sheets in an Excel worksheet when you connect to it additionally power bi Imports a prebuilt report when you connect to a SAS application so there are two modes to view and interact with reports there is reading View and there is editing view when you open a report it opens in Reading view if you have the edit permissions then you see edit report in the upper left corner and you can view the report in editing view anyone with an admin member or contributor role can edit a report if it is in a workspace they have access to all the exploring designing building and sharing capabilities of editing view for that report the people they share the report with can explore and interact with the report in Reading View when you open a workspace the associated reports are listed under the reports tab each listed report represents one or more pages of visualizations based on only one of the underlying data sets to open a report select it you are presented with a dashboard when you first launch an app select a dashboard tile that was pinned from a report to see the underlying report you might need to click a few tiles before seeing a report because not all tiles are pinned from reports foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going into detail on what is a dashboard in power bi so a dashboard is something you create in the power bi service or something a colleague creates in the power bi service and shares with you it is a single canvas that contains zero or more tiles and widgets each tile pin from a report or from question and answer displays a single visualization that was created from a data set and pinned to the dashboard entire report Pages can also be pinned to a dashboard as a single tile the visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles you pin tiles to a dashboard from reports and each report is based on a data set a dashboard is an introduction to the underlying reports and data sets selecting a visualization takes you to the report and data set that it's based on you can pin many kinds of tiles to dashboards you can pin a tile from a report pin a tile from another dashboard pin a tile from Excel you can create a tile in question and answer and pin it you can pin an entire report page and you can also add images videos and more to a dashboard let's take a look at some of the advantages of dashboards first you can see in one glance all the information needed to make decisions you can monitor the most important information about your business you can ensure all colleagues are on the same page viewing and using the same information to monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign Etc and you can create a personalized view of a larger dashboard and show all the metrics that matter to them so that's a general overview of dashboards in power bi foreign users can get confused between a report and a dashboard so we'll go over the main differences between the two because there will definitely be some questions on it in the exam for the pages capability dashboards can only have one page whereas reports can have one or more pages for data sources dashboards can have one or more reports and one or more data sets per dashboard reports can only have a single data set per report for drilling down in visuals this can be done for dashboards only if you pin an entire report page to a dashboard on the other hand drilling down in visuals is available for reports dashboards are not available in power bi desktop reports are available in power bi desktop you can build and view reports in power bi desktop you can't filter or slice a dashboard you can filter a dashboard tile in Focus mode but can't save the filter however filtering is available for reports there are many different ways to filter highlight and slice for favorites you can set multiple dashboards and multiple reports as favorites for natural language queries this is available for both dashboard words and reports but you'll need edit permissions for the report and underlying data set for set alerts this is available for dashboard tiles in certain circumstances but this is not available for reports for the Subscribe capability you can subscribe to dashboard and a report so these are the main capabilities you'll be using for dashboards and reports there are a few more but the list is simply too large to fit foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going through template apps for power bi so power bi Partners can create power bi templates with little to no coding and deploy them to any power bi customer using the new Power bi template apps you can create a set of outofthebox content for your customers and publish it yourself as a power bi partner you can build template apps that allow your customers to connect within their own accounts as domain experts they can unlock the data in a way that is easy for their business users to consume template apps are submitted to the partner Center to become publicly available in the power bi apps Marketplace and on Microsoft appsource power bi template apps allow power bi Pro or power bi premium users to gain immediate insights through per package dashboards and reports that can be connected to live data sources many power bi apps are already available in the power bi apps Marketplace such as the covid19 US tracking report Google analytics report and the Microsoft 365 usage Analytics the next topic we'll be covering is data modeling and visualizations power bi desktop is a free application installed on your local computer that allows you to connect to transform and visualize your data you can connect to multiple different sources of data and combine them which is often called modeling into a data model with power bi desktop you can create visuals and collection of visuals using this data model which you can then share as reports with others most users who work on business intelligence projects create their reports using power bi desktop then share them with others using the power bi service in power bi desktop you will begin to create reports in the report View there are five main areas you will be working with first we have the ribbon this displays the common tasks that are related with reports and visualizations next we have the report view or canvas this is where visualizations are created and arranged the data view allows you to view all your data available in your report it is an easy way to quickly check data types and validate data the model view allows you to visually set the relationship between tables or elements our relationship is where two or more tables are linked together because they contain related data this enables users to run queries for related data across multiple tables the third area we have is the pages tab this area is where you would select or add a report page located along the bottom of the page next we have the visualizations pane this is where you can change visualizations customize colors or axes apply filters drag fields and more and finally we have the fields pane this is where query elements and filters can be dragged onto the report view or dragged to the filters area of the visualizations pane foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is the types of visualization in power bi so starting off with bar and column charts bar charts are the industry standard for viewing specific value across different categories here we have a visual example of a bar chart displaying counts of visits by building and here we have the chart in a column chart format so let's look at some more types of visualizations in power bi first we have cards these can be viewed in single or multirow next we have kpis these display progress toward a measurable goal next we have Maps basic Maps these are used to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations then we have pie charts and pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole another type of visualization is the question and answer visual this lets you ask questions about your data using natural language finally we have tables tables work well with quantitative comparisons among items where there are many categories these are some of the out of the box or prebuilt power bi visuals available from the visualization pane in power bi desktop and power bi service however there are some instances where you need a more custom Visual and these can be found in appsource for power bi foreign as mentioned in the previous video there are some instances where users will need a more custom Visual and these can be found in appsource for power bi so power bi visuals are provided to the public by Microsoft and members of the community who then publish them to the app source to make them available for use these visuals can be downloaded and added to your power bi reports Microsoft has tested and approved these power bi visuals for functionality and Quality Power bi certified visuals or visuals in the app source that were additionally tested to check that the visual does not access external services or resources after importing power bi visualizations from appsource updates may happen automatically without further notification so what is appsource app source is the place for apps addins and extensions for your Microsoft software appsource connects millions of users of products such as Microsoft 365 Azure Dynamics 365 Cortana and power bi to solutions that help them get work done more efficiently and insightfully than before next we have certified power bi visuals certify power bi visuals or visuals and appsource that meet certain specified code requirements that the Microsoft power bi team has tested and approved the tests are designed to check that the visual doesn't access external services or resources so that's a general overview of custom visuals hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going over filtering data with power bi in a simple type of filtering called a slicer so data is the core of power bi as you explore reports each visual draws its underlying data from sources that often contain far more data than you need filtering is a technique used to focus on a subset of data in the chart making it easier to analyze and identify patterns or Trends power bi offers several ways to filter and highlight reports knowing how to filter data is the key to finding the right information when you filter a visual like a bar chart you are just changing the view of the data in that visual you are not modifying The Source data in any way remember to keep in mind that filtering only applies to reports not to dashboards a simple type of filtering that you can use directly on the report page is called a slicer slicers provide cues to ways you can filter the results and the visuals on a report page there are several different types of slicers such as numeric categorical and date slicers make it easy to filter all the visuals on the page at once so when should you use a slicer well slicers are a great choice when you want to display commonly used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access make it easier to see the current filtered State without having to open a drop down list filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables and when you want to create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals also note that power bi slicers don't support input fields and drilled out options explore the filters pane another way to filter data is by opening and modifying filters in the filters pane the filters pane contains filters that were added to the report by the report designer as a consumer you can interact with the filters and save your changes but cannot add new filters there are four types of filters first we have report this applies to all pages in the report then we have page this applies to all the visuals on the current report page next we have visual this applies to a single visual on a report page you only see visual level filters if you have selected a visual on the report canvas and the last type of filter is drill through this allows you to explore successively more detailed views within a single visual moving on to our next topic buttons in power bi so using buttons in power bi lets you create reports that behave like apps and thereby create an engaging environment so users can hover click and further interact with power bi material you can add buttons to reports and power bi desktop and in the power bi service when you share your reports in the power bi service they provide an app like experience for your users to create a button in power bi desktop on the insert ribbon select buttons and a drop down menu appears where you can select the button you want from a collection of options as shown in the image here are some key features and characteristics of buttons and power bi appearance buttons and power bi can be customized with various shapes sizes colors and text to fit the report design action buttons can be configured to perform a variety of actions including filtering data navigating to a different page or report opening a URL or file or running a custom script interaction buttons can be clicked by users to trigger the configured action and can be used to create a more interactive and engaging report experience selection buttons can be used as a selection tool to filter or highlight specific data by configuring them with a slicer or other interactive element integration buttons can be integrated with other power bi features and components such as bookmarks drill through actions and visual interactions to create a more Dynamic and customized report experience so that's a general overview of buttons and power bi hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is power query editor so sometimes your data might contain extra data or have data in the wrong format you may need additional columns or to rename or hide existing columns you may have multiple data sources and need to define a relationship between them all these tasks are known as data transformation power bi desktop includes the power query editor tool which can help you shape and transform data so that it's ready for your models and visualizations power query editor is a data transformation in preparation tool that allows users to connect to and transform data from a variety of sources like Excel spreadsheets text files databases and web services with power query editor users can extract transform and load data from these sources into Power bi for analysis and visualization it provides a userfriendly interface for data manipulation allowing users to filter sort group pivot and aggregate data using a series of intuitive and easy to use menus and tools it also supports it's merging splitting and unpivoting tables custom calculations and Transformations a key feature of power query editor is its ability to create reusable data queries which can be saved and shared with other users or used to automate data refreshes this can save significant time and effort for users who need to regularly transform and update large data sets launch power query Editor to begin select edit from the Navigator window to launch power query editor you can also launch power query editor directly from Power bi desktop by using the transform data button on the home ribbon in the ribbon the active buttons enable you to interact with the data in the query on the left pane queries are listed and available for selecting viewing and shaping on the center pane data from the selected query is displayed and available for shaping the query settings window lists the queries properties and applied steps so this is the general layout of the power query editor foreign so the next topic we'll be covering is an aggregate at times there may be a need to perform mathematical calculations on the values within your data the mathematical operation could be some average maximum count and so on this process of merging values in your data using mathematical operations is referred to as aggregation the outcome of the calculation is known as an aggregate when power bi service and power bi desktop create visualizations they may aggregate your data in some cases the resulting aggregate may be appropriate but at other times you may want to apply a different type of aggregation to the data such as calculating the sum or average of values there are several different ways to manage and change the aggregate power bi uses in a visualization typically data sets consist of multiple types of data and at the simplest level the data can be classified as either numeric or nonnumeric Tower bi can aggregate numeric data using a sum average count minimum variance and much more additionally power bi can even aggregate nonnumeric data which is often referred to as categorical data if you try to aggregate a categorical field by placing it in a numeric only bucket like values or tooltips power B I will count the occurrences of each category or count the distinct occurrences of each category special types of data like dates have a few of their own aggregate options earliest latest first and last for example according to the image provided units sold a manufacturing price or columns that contain numeric data segment country region product month and month name contain categorical data here we'll look at some of the ways to aggregate your data some of the options that may be available for aggregating a field do not summarize with this option chosen power bi treats each value in that field separately and doesn't summarize them so then this adds all the values in that field up average this takes an arithmetic mean of the values minimum this shows the smallest value maximum this shows the largest value count not blanks this counts the number of values in that field that are blank count the stanctive this counts the number of different values in that field standard deviation variance and median this shows the median value this value has the same number of items above and below if there are two medians power bi averages them foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the power bi security and administration power bi like many other Microsoft Services utilizes Azure as its foundation Azure is the cloud computing infrastructure and platform developed by Microsoft that guarantees the same level of security for power bi as other Microsoft Services when users sign into Power bi they use their credentials saved in Azure active directory which permits them to control the level of sharing for each report data or dashboard they can determine whether recipients are permitted to edit or just view the items it's important to note that users are responsible for the data they share if a user connects to data sources using their credentials they can share a report or dashboard or data set based on that data users with whom the dashboard is shared are authenticated against the original data source and will be granted access to the report this is beneficial to allow users to share reports and dashboards they have created but does require responsibility on the user's part power bi Administration is the management of a power bi tenant including the configuration of governance policies usage monitoring and provisioning of licenses capacities and organizational resources power bi is designed for selfservice business intelligence the administrator is the guardian of data processes and policies in the power bi tenant a power bi administrator is a key member of a team that includes bi developers analysts and other roles the administrator can help support an organization to make sure that critical goals are met so that's a general overview of the power bi security and administration hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be starting off by creating a Microsoft account so the first thing you want to do is to go to this link here called power.bi dot microsoft.com us and this will take you to this page here you can do this with other Power Platform services like power apps or power automate but since we'll be starting with power bi we'll be using this link and if you don't already have a Microsoft account you'd want to navigate to this button here and click on the try free button so this is the page where you would create your Microsoft account and enter in your email you want to register with and all the other information required let's go with this one Andrew Brown exam Pro gmail.com so for this method of registration you will need a work email so you can't use a commercial email account such as Hotmail and Gmail however there is another method to sign up this will require you to navigate to this page microsoft.com 365 slash Enterprise slash compare Dash office Dash 365plans this page provides you with a few Office 365 and Microsoft 365 apps plans such as Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise Office 365 E1 Office 365 E3 and office 365e5 there is an option to try for free and this will allow you to access and use all the apps on this list depending on the plan they may provide partial use of the app or some of the lower cost plans may not include some features the key apps that we're interested in are power apps power automate power virtual agents and power bi we'll be going with the Office 365 E5 plan because it includes power bi Pro so let's click on the try for free button here we'll enter in our email address Andrew Brown exam Pro gmail.com the list here shows all the apps and services you'll be getting in the Office 365 E5 trial plan and remember that you have a one month free trial so you have to cancel the trial before that day to avoid any fees so click on next then click on setup account now we'll need to provide information such as our first name surname business phone number company name company size and the country we reside in once we're done that we have to accept the terms of service looks like we have to provide a verification code let's enter that code in and verify to proceed next we have to create a domain name we'll try to keep it simple so let's go with exam Pro looks like exam Pro is already taken so let's try to add a one it's available so we can use this after that's complete we can create a password and confirm the password then press next next we'll have to add a payment method so you'll need to enter in your card information here and everything else that is required once again you'll have to remember to cancel before the one month period to avoid any charges on your card after that's complete we'll have to review all the information that we entered in and confirm to start the trial it'll just take a bit to add the products to our account but once that's complete we can start using the Office 365 E5 trial so click on that remember to use your domain email that we just created to sign in so in this case it's Andrew Brown at exam Pro one dot on microsoft.com enter in your password and click on sign in if you want to install Microsoft 365 on your computer you can click on here I already have it on my system so I can skip this step for the domain we can use the default exam Pro one dot on microsoft.com for now we won't need to add any users or assign licenses for now we can continue here as well after that's all done we can go to the admin Center feel free to look around the settings and features if you want to but now that we have a Microsoft account we should be able to log into the power bi platform so first we want to go back to the power bi dot microsoft.com earlier at the beginning then we want to click on the sign in page we can use our Microsoft account email that we created so we can just copy that onto here then click on submit this should log us into the power bi service now we have access to the power bi service and we can play around with it so that's how you can create a Microsoft account hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be looking at how to build a basic dashboard by using power bi so the first thing you want to do is to go to the power bi page at app.powerbi.com home here you'll be at the home page for power bi which will have recommendations for you to go to such as your recent workspaces what you've frequently opened how to get started and much more so on the left side pane we have a bunch of tabs such as create browse data Hub metrics and so on before we create our own report and dashboard let's quickly go through a sample report that power bi has provided for us so we'll click on learning under samples we'll click on Revenue opportunities so now you're seeing a power bi Report with nice visuals and a breakdown of the revenue opportunities report we have the opportunity revenue and opportunity count on the top left there is the opportunity count by region and pipeline by stage on the bottom left the revenue and opportunity count by month is located on the top right and the revenue by region and state is on the bottom right they are presented with different kinds of visuals like bar graphs line graphs map visuals gradients and so on we're also able to interact with the visuals so if you want to filter out certain regions metrics or any component of the graph you can do that for example if I only want to know the opportunity count by region in the East I can click on the East bar and it'll only show and calculate the values and highlighted areas for the results on the left side page if I click on detail it will show us the underlying table that has The Columns of data used to create the report so let's go back to the report and we'll click on the edit button in the middle this is where you can edit your entire report you have many kinds of visualizations available and filters you can select the data you want in a specific Visual and stylize it to your liking on the right we have the visualizations pane this is where you can build your visual with all kinds of charts like bar chart column chart line chart scatter chart pie chart map chart and many more so let's take a look at the bottom left chart here it's currently a stack bar chart but we can click on stack column chart and it'll change to it right away you can try out other visuals and experiment to see if it fits with the data selected but let's leave it at the stack column chart for now and if we click on the format visual button in the middle we can format the visual of the graph to whatever we want there are many settings we can change for example we can click on columns then click on the colors tab we can remove the conditional formatting of the gradient and add in a solid color or we can change the conditional formatting of the color to what we want we could also change the spacing of the columns to match the size that fits the graph or however thin or thick you want you have plenty of other options such as grid lines data labels and so on there are also General properties where you can edit the properties like the height and size of the chart as well as the position and we can choose to leave the title Auto or not there are additional effects you can add or change in the background visual border Shadow and much more on the right side we have the data pane this shows all the data available that you can use to create the visuals so if we were to click on the pipeline by stage graph we can see that it shows the data that has been used in the visual with the check boxes in this case we've used opportunity count and sales stage we can select different Columns of data and choose the kind of visual that fits it best for example I can choose something like product code and revenue and it'll change the graph using the data that I've selected we will also need to change the title of the graph so we'll go to format your visual then click on General and click on title change the text of the title to something fitting like product code by Revenue so you basically choose what you want to display on your report using the data that you have presented and stylize the visuals to your liking on the Middle top here we have something called ask a question this is a pretty neat feature where you can ask a question about your data it will provide you with suggested questions for you to start out and you can show all suggestions for more results so we can test this out by clicking on something like top states by factored revenue and it'll provide us with the top states by factored Revenue using the data we provided you can select other questions to try out or you can ask your own questions related to the data the next thing we'll be doing is creating a dashboard okay so let's click on the save button on the top right next we'll click on pin to a dashboard select new dashboard and we'll need to give the dashboard a name so we can use the same name as before Revenue opportunities then click on Pin live after that we can click on go to dashboard so this is the dashboard of Revenue opportunities similarly to the report we can interact with the dashboard visuals and select the key points of data that we want to see there is also a drop down menu for the product code to filter out the product codes and more the dashboard has a builtin question and answer at the top so you can ask questions about your data similarly to a report it will provide you with a visual of data that corresponds with the question asked going back to the dashboard we can edit the dashboard by adding a tile or changing the dashboard theme for example I can change the dashboard theme from light to dark making it easier on the eyes for adding a tile we can add many sources of media such as web content images text boxes videos as well as realtime data we won't need to know this for the exam but you can play around with the power bi features as you like hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering how to create a basic report in dashboard if you want to create your own report and dashboard instead of using a sample report you will need a data set if you have your own data set then you can upload by going to my workspace here you can upload your data from OneDrive for business SharePoint or you can browse from your own PC they must be a pbix RDL or xlsx file I'll upload the sales data economic analysis I downloaded earlier if you don't have a data set at hand you can search for what online there are plenty of sources on the internet that provide free data sets for you to learn and practice for example you can go to kaggle.com which is an online platform that offers a variety of resources for data scientists and machine learning practitioners such as data sets and tools to facilitate collaboration and learning I found a data set here called sales data for economic data analysis I clean the data up a bit and trim some of the data to make things less complicated you can use whichever date data set you find or what another way to upload data is simply copying or manually entering in data so you can click on create on the left side click on paste or manually enter data from your Excel file Google Sheets or any source that has a data set you can copy and paste the data into the table if your data has headers in the first row you want to click on the use first row as headers you also want to rename the table so we'll rename this to sales data economic we can choose to Auto create report create a blank report or create a data set only but we'll choose autocreate report to use as a starting point okay here we are free to play around with the current design we have first we need to change this to edit mode so click on that then we need to change some of the data on the graphs to the data that we're interested in and to ensure that the data makes sense because sometimes the auto create report uses data like total sum of age which is something we don't want so I've chosen the data that I want for my graphs and the types of visuals that look appropriate for them now we'll be adjusting the size of the canvas and we'll try to go for a different look to do this we'll go to the format page then canvas settings and we'll want to select a custom type so we can change the height and width that suits the report we can enter in something like 1000 pixels height and 1200 pixels width you can choose what you think is best after that we'll be moving around the graphs and visuals to see where we want to place them or if we think it looks suitable we'll also be adjusting the sizes of the graphs in visuals so it makes sense or looks decent enough I'll be speeding through this section because it's mostly just adjusting the graph's positions and making sure they align well with the canvas so you won't be missing out on anything too important we want to try something a little unique so we'll be providing it with a dark background you will need to go to format page then click on canvas background change the color to a dark color and lower the transparency so that it's visible you can also use an image that you have on your personal computer by clicking browse we'll be using a dark blue gradient background we found with a simple Google search after seeing the white boxes I've made a few more adjustments to the placements of the graphs we will need to remove the white boxes from the graphs and text boxes so we'll need to click on effects and turn off the background so we'll have to adjust the font to White so it's easier to read we'll need to do this for these visual cards so it's the same process click on category labels then change the font color to white then on the callout values also change the font to White for the graphs we'll need to turn the background off so click on General then click on effects then click the toggle to turn the background off then you need to click on visual then click on the xaxis here you will need to change the value font to White then you will need to change the title font to White you will also need to change the font color to white for the yaxis you will need to change the title font to White so you'll have to click on data labels then click on values then change the font to White you will need to change the title font to White I realized I forgot to change the transparency to zero so you'll be able to see the dark blue gradient so as you can see it's starting to look better we'll continue to change the fonts for the remaining graphs we will apply the same steps like the sub of Revenue by month graph so we'll need to change the xaxis and yaxis fonts to White and we'll need to change the color of the title and data labels to White and we need to turn off the background so we'll be speeding through this process since we already know how to execute this the bar colors look at bit plain so we'll add a gradient effect to make it look more interesting to do this we'll click on format visual then click on bars then click on the FX button the default gradient color they provided looks decided so we'll press ok we also want to turn off the legend since it automatically turned on once we applied a gradient we'll try to apply this to the other graphs as well so we'll go through the same procedure click on bars then click on the FX button we want to keep the orange color to mix it up a bit so we'll try to find lighter orange for the minimum then we'll find a darker orange for the maximum then click OK we'll also want to get rid of the legend since it doesn't look too appealing in my opinion same process for the final graph we'll also give it a gradient okay so this looks fine it's not perfect but it's definitely more interesting than the default design that they provided for us after that you can save the report and we can do the same thing as we did in the previous video pin to dashboard and Pin live so all in all you can customize and design the report however you want using all the tools effects colors visuals available in power bi until you are satisfied with your design hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering power apps in Greater detail power apps is a low code no code platform developed by Microsoft that allows users to build custom business applications for web and mobile devices it enables users to create custom apps using a drag and drop interface and prebuilt templates without the need for extensive coding knowledge with power apps users can create apps that connect to various data sources including

the same drag and drop experience you enjoy when building apps is available to build these rich interactive websites so that's a general overview of powerapps portals hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll cover is AI Builder AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes AI Builder enables your business to use intelligence to automate processes and glean insights from your data in powerapps in power automate with AI Builder you can Leverage The Power of AI without having any coding or data science skills you can build custom models tailored to your needs or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios integration with powerapps and power automate mix using AI easy to add intelligence to your business why to choose an AI model type use the model type that suits your business need choose from a growing set of AI solutions to connect data select your business specific data from the available options three tailor your AI model depending on the type of model you can tweak custom models to optimize how your AI performs for train your AI model training is an automatic process it teaches your AI model how to resolve your business problem for example how to recognize your products on an image based on your business data and tailoring when trained your AI model can generate insights such as the result of a prediction or the list and number of objects detected in an image five use insights from your AI model use the results from your AI model across Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs even if you have no coding skills for example you can create a flow that automates document processing in power automate or an app in power apps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance foreign you can use AI builder in Microsoft power apps in one of two ways depending on the model you will be using you can use AI models in the formula bar or add AI Builder components use AI models in the formula bar you can get support for the following AI Builder models that use power apps through the formula bar here is a table that shows the model types available and the build types you can use it's either prebuilt or built and custom for the sentiment analysis model type the build type is prebuilt for entity extraction the build type is for built and custom for key phrase extraction it's prebuilt for language detection it's prebuilt and for category classification it's prebuilt and Custom at AI Builder components AI Builder provides two kinds of power apps components choose your component based on the models you want to use components that use per built AI models that are ready to use right away business card reader for canvas app business card reader for model driven app receipt processor for canvas app and text recognizer for canvas app components that use custom AI models that you build and train form processor and object detector the business card reader is an example of a prebuilt component that uses AI components which can also be used in other ways by creating a custom model to create a model users can follow a stepbystep process using the wizard available on make.powerapps.com currently powerapps offers four AI models which are prediction this model uses historical data to predict future events form processor this model can extract text from images such as with the business card reader object detector this model can identify objects and images and provide a count of the number of objects present text classification this model categorizes text by its meaning to facilitate analysis the prediction model the AI Builders prediction model allows users to generate a model that can predict yes or no outcomes based on historical data you train the model by providing historical data that includes the yes no outcome AI builder takes care of the rest with the prediction model users can create solutions for various business problems such as will Elite convert to a customer will a project generate profit will a customer stop using the product based on their activity hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this section we'll be covering the functions in powerapps in a bit more detail when working with Microsoft power apps you don't need to have expertise in writing complex application code like a professional developer however you still need to express the app's logic and manage its features such as navigation filtering and sorting this is where formulas become useful if you're familiar with Microsoft Excel functions you'll find it easy to develop apps using power apps to create a formula you'll combine one or more formulas with the necessary and optional parameters these are some common functions used in powerapps and their purposes filter this function is typically used in conjunction with tables or galleries of data to narrow down the rows retrieved from the data source by specifying one or more columns in your data set to perform a logical test on you can return data that falls within a specific date range as a particular value or was created by the user for instance match this function allows you to check whether a value follows a specified pattern you can utilize it to validate if the user has entered a correctly formatted email address and if not display a warning message indicating that a valid email is required this function is particularly useful for conditional formatting distinct this function enables you to retrieve the unique values from a list of data simplifying the process of creating Dynamic drop down menus that display only valid values for a given column math functions powerapps features a variety of math formulas for manipulating your data ranging from simple operations like sum and average to more advanced functions such as aten and sin for working with radians power apps can create three types of apps canvas model driven and portals each is suited to different scenarios and end users the first one we'll be covering are canvas apps so canvas apps are a low code application development platform that allows users to create custom business applications using a drag and drop interface with canvas apps users start with a blank canvas and add controls such as buttons labels and text boxes to create a custom user interface users can then connect these controls to data sources such as Microsoft 365 Dynamics 365 SharePoint or other thirdparty data sources to create datadriven applications canvas apps offer extensive customization options allowing users to modify the appearance and behavior of controls create custom formulas and expressions and integrate with other Microsoft services they can also be deployed to a variety of platforms including web browsers and mobile devices canvas apps are best suited for scenarios where a high degree of customization and flexibility is required such as when building custom business processes or workflows some common use cases and capabilities of canvas apps include custom forms and data entry canvas apps can be used to create custom forms and data entry interfaces that can be integrated with various data sources like Microsoft Excel SharePoint or Dynamics 365 this makes it easier to collect and organize data in a way that is specific to your business requirements workflow automation with canvas apps users can build custom workflows that automate business processes like approvals notifications or routing of work items this capability can be integrated with power automate enabling you to connect to over 275 external services and apis custom dashboards and analytics canvas apps can be used to create custom dashboards and analytics that display key metrics and data visualizations in a way that is Meaningful to your business this can be integrated with powerby allowing you to create interactive reports and data visualizations mobile applications canvas apps can be used to create mobile applications that are optimized for smartphones and tablets this can be useful for creating custom applications for field employees sales teams or other remote workers integration with other services canvas apps can be integrated with other Microsoft services like Dynamics 365 power automate and power bi this makes it possible to create custom applications that are tailored to your specific business needs and that can be integrated with other applications or services foreign apps has many different components to build Solutions including screens inputs galleries forms and more power app studio is the webbased interface that enables you to create your app without requiring you to download or install a separate client by logging into https colon slash make.powerapps.com from your browser you can build your app entirely online using powerapps app for vet the first step in creating your app is to choose the format of your app mobile or tablet while both formats are compatible with mobile device a tablet or a computer each has different defaults regarding the size of the screens and controls once you choose the format for an app you cannot change it galleries the gallery control is used to display rows from a table of data the display of a row is then defined by a template which you can customize to meet your needs this allows you to control which columns are shown and how they are formatted power apps will then apply this template automatically to every Row in your data forms forms are focused on working with a specific record often based on a selection from a gallery and this experience a user browses a gallery to find and select the desired row to view the details on the form forms enable a user to not only view detailed information but to save new records and edit existing ones the various actions performed with forms are controlled by Form nodes allowing the form to serve many purposes input controls powerapps provides a wide range of input controls to offer maximum flexibility while customizing your apps these controls include text inputs buttons dropdowns toggles date Pickers and Sliders among others you can seamlessly integrate these controls into galleries forms and screens to create an aesthetically appealing and functional app furthermore all these inputs come with various settings for default data formatting and actions empowering you to develop an app that offers an optimal user experience for your business process intelligent controls in addition to Common inputs powerapps also provides a rich set of controls for more advanced operations these include hardwarebacked controls that provide access to features like the camera Barcode Scanner GPS and other Hardware related functionalities there are also service backed controls like the business card reader and object detector which enable you to incorporate artificial intelligence into your app without writing any code functions functions play a crucial role in connecting controls inputs and data sources and power apps by using functions you can create formulas that perform various actions such as formatting data sending data to a data source or creating animations these formulas are similar to excel functions and do not require complex coding they are easy to use and can enhance the functionality of your app hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be looking at how to build a basic canvas app so before we begin we'll need a sample data set that we can provide to powerapps which will enable it to connect and create a canvas app we will need to navigate to this pagelearn.microsoft.com and US slash power Dash apps slash maker slash canvas Dash apps slash get Dash started Dash create Dash from Dash data this page provides steps to create a canvas app with data from an Excel file and provides a sample data set we can use there are many data connectors to use but for this example we'll use an Excel file you are free to use your own Excel file but the data must be formatted as a table so the first thing we'll have to do is download the flooring estimates Excel file I already have the file downloaded on my computer so I won't need to download it again once you have it downloaded you'll want to upload this file onto your OneDrive so you'll have to go to the OneDrive this is part of your Microsoft 365 account and is linked to apps like powerapps power bi power automate and other apps click on upload then file then choose the flooring estimates Excel file I already have it uploaded on my OneDrive so I won't need to upload it after you're finished uploading you'll need to navigate to the powerapps page to do that you can click on the top left Square dots then click on all apps then you can use the search tool or you can scroll down to find power apps click on power apps to open the powerapps page once we have arrived here we want to click on create as you can see there are many connections to choose from but we'll be using the Excel file we uploaded so we'll click on Excel so after you click on Excel you want to click on OneDrive for business if you don't have a OneDrive for business connection already you'll be prompted to create one by clicking the new connection button then you'll click on the flooring estimates file choose the table and click on connect here you will see an app that is created with the flooring estimates data you can press the play button or F5 to preview the app and play here it provides the entire list of items in the Excel file that we provided it has structured the data in an interactive canvas app which displays the images and details on each item and it includes multiple functions such as a search option new item button and more you can click on the right arrow to view the item in more detail it will provide the category the image the name a description and a price for the specific item there is an edit button to edit out the specific fields that we've mentioned and there is a delete button to delete the item there's also a sort list button to sort by alphabetical order and a refresh button in case one of your team members has updated the Excel data set so you can click on the X on the top right or press escape to go back to the previous working canvas view also there's a good tip here where you can hold the ALT key to activate buttons and other controls while you are working on the app normally if you click on the buttons you'll just select and highlight the area and you can edit it but if you hold the ALT key you can activate the button in controls like this so you won't need to preview the app and can edit it while testing it so on the left here shows a tree view of all our items and as you notice that with every item that I'm selecting the things on the working canvas are being selected as well you can see that things like next Arrow one subtitle one search icon 1 and so on are correspond to in the working canvas so let's take a look at something like the subtitle one here on the right hand side it shows all the properties that we can edit for the specific item that we've selected for example I can change the font weight to bold which should reflect on the app right away I can change the text to something else like Ariel I can change the font color to something like blue or we can change it to something like orange but let's leave it the way it originally was for now so as you can see on the left in the tree view this app is broken down into three screens there is the browse screen which is the main screen you see with the list of items there is the detail screen which displays the details of each item and there's the edit screen which allows you to edit the fields on a specific item and each one of these screens has its own layout that is made up of buttons forms functions items and such for that specific screen for the user to interact with some of these buttons may have functions as you can see on the function bar it shows new form edit Form 1 and it navigates to edit screen one but since it's a fundamental course you won't need to know each and every function and how to use them at a high level so we can do some small changes to this such as adding a space to the flooring estimates title to make it more legible remember that this only applies to the browse screen so we'll have to change the for estimate title for the detail and edit screen as well you can insert all kinds of items and controls such as text labels edit forms buttons and many more so overall there are many ways to customize and design the way your canvas app looks using any structured data set you want you can add data integration from a variety of sources including Excel SharePoint and SQL Server and you can publish and share their canvas apps within their organization or even publicly hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering model driven apps so a model driven app is a type of app that is designed to present data in a structured and organized way using prebuilt components and a data model that defines the relationships between different data entities in a model driven app the user interface is generated automatically based on the data model which allows users to interact with the app in a consistent and intuitive way model driven apps and power apps are typically used for complex scenarios where data is stored in multiple tables and there are complex relationships between them for example a model driven app could be used to manage a customer relationship management system where data is stored in tables such as contacts accounts and opportunities the app would provide prebuilt components such as forms lists and charts that allow users to view create and edit data in a structured way one of the key advantages of model driven apps and power apps is that they provide a high degree of flexibility and customization users can modify the data model to add new tables or fields and they can customize the user interface by adding or removing components changing layouts and applying themes in summary a model driven app in powerapps is a powerful tool for building custom business applications that provide a structured and organized way to interact with complex data models before we go more in detail on model driven apps we'll go through the main differences between model driven apps and canvas apps the main difference between model driven apps and canvas apps and powerapps is the way the user interface is designed and how data is presented model driven apps have an automatically generated prebuilt interface based on a data model while canvas apps allow users to design the interface from scratch using prebuilt components and formulas model driven apps are best for complex data models with multiple tables while canvas apps are ideal for simpler models or highly customized interfaces here are some key differences between model driven apps and canvas apps and power apps user interface model driven apps have a prebuilt structured user interface based on the data model while canvas apps allow users to design the user interface from scratch data model driven apps are designed to work with complex data models that have multiple tables and relationships while canvas apps are better suited for simpler data models customization canvas apps provide more customization options than model driven apps but they also require more design work development speed model driven apps can be developed more quickly than canvas apps because much of the user interface is prebuilt but they may be less flexible in terms of design overall the choice between model driven apps and canvas apps depends on the specific requirements of your application if you need to work with a complex data model a model driven app may be the better choice well if you need more flexibility in terms of design a canvas app may be the way to go in canvas apps the App Maker has total control over the app layout with model driven apps much of the layout is determined by the components you add here is a table to view the differences between the two apps per category to make it more digestible it's a bit redundant to what we've already stated but it doesn't hurt to reinforce the information you'll need to know for the exam data platform for model driven apps its dataverse only whereas for canvas apps it's dataverse plus many others using connectors design experience there is no code component focused design for model driven apps but for canvas apps there is manipulation of control properties using Power FX Expressions eui control for model driven apps there is limited predominantly customization canvas apps have full control for model driven apps the app consistency is high differs predominantly based on the tables and Views chosen for canvas apps it's often low given the significant control the designers have of the user experience the migration between environments is simple for model driven apps and potentially complex given that the data sources may need to be updated for canvas apps speed of creation is rapid for model driven apps and relative to the complexity of the design for canvas apps it's automatically responsive for model driven apps and only responsive if designed in this way for canvas apps for model driven apps the navigation through relationships is automatic provided relationships exist and for canvas apps it's only where designed and applied using Power FX formulas accessibility features are built in for model driven apps whereas for canvas apps it's designed into the app create accessible canvas apps foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the three design phases of a model driven app so model driven apps have three design phases why to model your business data to Define your business processes three build the app model your business data model driven design uses metadata driven architecture so that designers can customize apps without writing code to model business data you determine what data the app will need and how that data will relate to other data metadata means data about data and defines the structure of the data stored in Microsoft dataverse you create a data model that defines the structure of the data that the app will use this includes defining entities and the relationships between them you can also Define data fields views and charts Define your business processes defining and enforcing consistent business processes is a key aspect of model driven app design consistent processes help ensure that your app users can focus on their work and not worry about having to remember to perform a set of manual steps processes can be simple or complex and they often change over time you define the business processes that the app will support such as workflows approvals and notifications you can use the builtin tools and power apps to create and manage these processes the screenshot illustrates the impact of having a business process flow in place build the app after modeling data and defining processes you build your app by selecting and setting up the components you need in the app designer you create the user interface for the app using prebuilt components such as forms lists and charts the user interface is generated automatically based on the data model you created in the first phase you can also customize the user interface by adding or removing components changing layouts and applying themes foreign the next topic we'll be covering are the building blocks of model driven apps starting with data the table below shows the different data components that can make up a model driven app which can determine what data the app will be based upon it also shows what designer is used to create or edit the data component table tables or items with properties that you track examples include contacts and accounts many standard tables are available you can customize a nonsystem standard table you could also create a custom table from scratch column columns are properties that are associated with a table and help Define that table a column is defined by a data type which determines the type of data that can be entered or selected examples of data types include text number date and time currency and look up columns are typically used in forms views and searches relationship relationships Define how tables can be related to each other there are one and and one and then and relationships for example adding a lookup column to a table creates a new one and relationship between the two tables and lets you add that lookup column to a form choice this type of column shows a control that lets the user select among predefined options each option has a number value in a label Choice columns can require either a single value or multiple values user interface the table below shows the user interface components which determine how users will interact with the app and what designer is used to create or edit the component app apps determine the app fundamentals like components properties the client type and the URL sitemap a sitemap specifies the navigation for your app for it forms include a set of data entry columns for a given table a form can be used to create a new data row or edit an existing one view views Define how a list of rows for a specific table appears in your app a view defines the column shown Logic the logic components determine what business processes rules and automation the app will have Microsoft power apps makers use a designer that is specific to the type of process or rule they are needing business process flow business process flows walk users through a standard business process use a business process flow if you want everyone to handle customer service requests the same way or you can use a business process flow to require staff to gain approval for an invoice before submitting an order workflow workflows automate business processes without a user interface designers use workflows to initiate automation that does not require any user interaction actions actions are a type of process that lets you manually invoke behaviors including custom actions directly from a workflow business rule business rules apply rules or recommendation logic to a form to set field requirements hide or show Fields validate data and more app designers use a simple interface to implement and maintain fast changing and commonly used rules flows power automate is a cloudbased service that lets you create automated workflows between apps and services to get notifications sync files collect data and more visualization the visualization components determine what type of data and Reporting the app will show and have available in which designer is used to create or edit the component chart charts are individual graphical visualizations that can appear in a view or a form or that can be added to a dashboard dashboard dashboards show one or more graphical visualizations in one place that provide an overview of actionable business data embedded Microsoft power via power bi ads embedded power bi tiles and dashboards to your app power bi is a cloudbased service that provides business intelligence insight please another important aspect of a model driven app is the business logic model driven apps are created using the app designer users select tables dashboards business process flows forms and other components to be made available in the app which will then be automatically generated this means you will need to spend more time understanding what your user needs and how it is going to look business logic when incorporating business logic in your app there are two primary options available you can set business rules on your Microsoft dataverse tables or you can build business process flows with business rules you'll Define behaviors of the data layer business rules are great for setting conditions for when a field is required setting a default value or even showing or hiding a field based on criteria an example could be a table for tracking expenses you could have a column for type of travel and then build a business rule that dictates that if a user chooses automobile then the mileage field is required else it is optional this gives you the power to make sure you maintain data consistency in all scenarios and powerapps a business process flow is a feature that helps guide users through a specific process or workflow within an app they can be used to standardize processes ensure consistency and improve efficiency a business process flow consists of a series of stages and steps each with its own set of fields and actions users can move through the stages and steps to complete the process and business process flows can be set up to require certain fields or data entry before advancing to the next stage they can be associated with specific entities and power apps such as leads opportunities or cases and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the organization additionally business process flows can be used in conjunction with other features in power apps such as business rules to further enhance the user experience and streamline workflows hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be providing a brief overview of dashboards and power apps in powerapps a dashboard is a user interface that provides a summary view of data from various sources dashboards and power apps typically include visualizations such as charts graphs tables and other data driven components that allow users to quickly and easily View and analyze data in a centralized location powerapps dashboards can be customized to meet specific business requirements and can be created using various data sources including Microsoft dataverse Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint lists users can also create multiple dashboards and share them with specific individuals or groups within the organization dashboards and power apps are an essential component of data analysis and visualization providing users with a clear and concise view of key performance indicators Trends and other critical business metrics you can Implement dashboards with custom filters and visual Graphics to tie all this data together right in your app when creating your dashboards make sure they are simple for your users to consume without overwhelming them with all the data provide highlevel snapshots of your data and allow them to use filters to dive deeper into the data if needed foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we'll be going over a sample of a model driven app so the first thing you want to do is to go to the powerapps page which is at make dot powerapps.com here it provides you with a lot of options to build business apps you can start from blank dataverse SharePoint Excel SQL and so on let's start by using a template that is already prepared for us this will give us a better understanding of a model driven app like the structure and all the tables of data that are linked together so we'll be clicking on the create button on the left side panel scroll down and look for the templates as you can see we have a lot of templates we can choose from but let's take a look at Innovation Challenge which is labeled as a model driven app click on create now that we have it loaded we can look at this page in better detail so in the center box is the model driven app View on the left you can see the pages tab currently open you also have other tabs here such as navigation data and automation we won't have to worry too much about it as of now on the right hand side are the properties that you can edit or change depending on what you are selecting it could be the content type title icon ID and so on so let's press the play button on the top right to preview this model driven app okay so what we're currently viewing right now is a dashboard the use case we're seeing generally involves Gathering ideas and Concepts transforming them into projects and connecting them with larger business strategies and this model driven app has tables that are related to each other and we want to be able to track all of those things so this dashboard consists of visually appealing charts and lists of items that make it easy to see what's going on and this application has three tables in it we have challenges ideas and team projects so if we take a look at challenges this will show us a view of tables consisting of the name number of ideas launch date accept new ideas and so on we can sort however we like or filter by using more advanced features we can also edit the information on the tables if we wish to so if we were to double click into one of these challenges such as the connected operations at the top here we have a business process flow and this guides the user across the stages and steps of an endtoend process that you've made in your business that you want to track manage and report on so as you can see we have lots of different fields of information such as the description and order we have a drag and drop with multiple different boxes you can check like email teams and phone we have a list of stakeholders at other records so one challenge may be linked to many contributed ideas and so on I'm able to click on one of those ideas and see something similar for example if I click on the fleet automation idea you can see another business process flow at the top here you can see the visibility of that parent challenge record showing through with readonly Fields here you can see the investment required of fifty thousand dollars the time to Roi of 12 months status reason is active the idea score is 9 and the risk score is five then the other thing we can do with the business process flow is approve the project stages manually and proceed to the next stage however they must meet the set of requirements and if we look at the team projects tab we will see the list of active team projects here we see the fleet automation that we were just on listing all the relevant information on that so you can sort of see how the tables and data are linked together through many relationships and how it can be sorted and transformed into a dashboard as mentioned before this dashboard is built using these three tables challenges ideas and team projects which is part of the Innovation Challenge model driven app thank you hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we'll be covering how to create a basic model driven app or specifically a simplified version of The Innovation Challenge model driven app we showed earlier so as we've mentioned before model driven apps are built using Microsoft dataverse and if we click on tables you will see a list of tables ready for you to use for common activities or scenarios the most common data tables user account and contacts because when you are doing anything that involves customers these will most likely come into play you can choose to use them or not but you'll see that they're comprehensive you can add to them or you can edit them in your app so you've got that starting point so let's click on Solutions and click on Innovation Challenge as you can see our Innovation Challenge currently has no objects so we'll need to create some if we recall the Innovation Challenge at three tables challenge ideas and team projects we'll only be creating the challenge and ideas tables for this simplified version let's click on the new button then towards table so for the display name this will be challenge we can enable attachments if we want click on Advanced options and here we have many options and boxes we can select such as track changes setting up SharePoint document management and so on but what we want to select is the create new activity this will create a timeline that's going to be in the middle now that we have a table created we're going to need to create some of the columns that were in The Innovation Challenge app so let's click on columns under the schema box as you can see there's already a list of columns in the powerapps environment for common use cases such as created by created on Modified by owner and so on you can set up all kinds of ownership and security and permissions which allows you to control that at a very granular level if we recall from The Innovation Challenge app edit columns like description duration accept new ideas until and communicate via these aren't included in the common columns that powerapps has provided so we'll need to create them and customize them similarly to the app click on new column give the display name is description the data type will be text and we want the multiple lines of text to be rich text click on Save we'll now need to create the accept new ideas until column so click on new column again the display name is accept new ideas until use the data type drop down menu to select date and time and we'll select date only then click on save it the next column We'll add is the duration column so click on new column the display name is duration weeks and brackets and we want the data type to be number and select whole number click on Save click on new column again this column is the communicate via column the data type will be choice and we want to choose the selecting multiple choices as a loud checkbox and on the bottom we want to select new choice the display name will be communication here we'll be making the three choices the first one is email click on new Choice label the second choices teams then the last label is phone we can add color to the boxes to make them a bit more visually appealing and easier to distinguish by selecting the Box on the left after that's done click on Save next we have to sync this Choice with the communication choice that we just created so search for that and select communication save that as well okay now let's create the ideas table click on new click on table the display name is idea and we also want to have the same features as the first table so we'll click on the creating a new activity checkbox so we can have that timeline of activities in it let's add a column to the idea table called investment required so same process click on new then click on column the display name is investment required for the data type it will be currency click save you can make the app as complex as you want by adding it as many tables and different things to it so the next thing we're going to do is create something called a lookup column for the idea table this links these two together from the idea table back to the originating challenge table so we'll click on new then select column we'll name this origin challenge the data type will be lookup and the related table will be challenge click on Save so if we click on relationships from the schema box we should be able to see the origin challenge that we created between the two tables The Challenge and idea tables are linked together through their relationships you can also create relationships here on the top left such as many to one one to many and many to many a lot of the work is already done for you with the intersecting tables behind the scenes so you won't have to worry too much about that the next component we want to look at is views so click on views in the idea table then click on active ideas this is where you build your app component you get to choose the columns you want and do the filtering process this is a drag and drop interface so you can drag in the columns such as the investment required column we just created and we can add in the origin challenge into the view organize the columns and resize to your fitting we can also add and edit filters and sorting orders so that it comes up filtered by certain things you might want to Only See next click on Save is then click on Save and click back to return to the previous screen the next thing we'll be creating is called a form so you want to click on the challenges table and click on forms then you want to click on information the form type is main should be fine this is pretty much the skeleton and structure of the table where you'll be able to enter in information and create challenges so in here you're able to add different kinds of columns and headings and things on the page on the bottom right let's click on layout and change it to three columns wide similarly to the original app you can have one two or three columns next let's track some of the columns that we made that were for the Innovation Challenge app accept new ideas until can be placed on the top right communicate via can be placed below the owner the description Rich text box can be placed between the name and owner we can place the duration on the top right as well let's click on the components we'll be adding a timeline in the column here and we'll be creating something called the subgrid so we'll need to scroll through and select the ideas table for this and then the default view of active ideas is already set click on done move it over to the right column so let's rename these labels because new SG control with these numbers isn't very helpful we'll name the separate as ideas and we'll give the column label section the contributing ideas we can rename the middle column section to something like events you can customize it to however you're liking there are many features and components you can add to it so this should be similar enough to The Innovation Challenge app so we'll click on save a copy then click save it next we'll return to the innovation app page this time we'll be creating a business process flow which was the bar at the top that takes you from the end to end of the stages and steps of the process so click on new drop down menu to automation then process and click on business process flow we'll need to provide a name for it so challenge process seems fine we'll need to select which table it's related to so we're using the challenge table click on create on the top left we'll need to add more stages to the business process flow The Innovation Challenge app had four stages so we'll need to create three more stages you can create as many as you want but we'll keep it similar to the original let's give the stages a name just like the business process flow in the innovation app so the first stage is set up the second stage is track the third stage is Select and execute and the fourth stage is close in award in these stages we'll need to provide a data step for each one of them so to keep things simple we'll give duration in weeks for the data fields in all the stages if you don't have the data steps set up you won't be able to activate the business process flow you can also add conditions and more complex features but we'll keep it simple in this app after adding the data steps click on Saved then you can click on activate okay so the next step is to create the model driven app so click on new drop down menu to app then click on model driven app we'll give the model driven app a name so Innovation Challenge app is fine click on creative next we'll need to add a page so click on ADD page then choose the dataverse table then click next we'll be adding in the challenge and idea table that we created into our model driven app so click on ADD page again dataverse table then click on next find the idea table and click add we also want to rename the group one on our app so let's click on the navigation tab click on Group 1 and rename to something appropriate for the app like innovation next we'll need to click on the automation tab on the left we'll need to add our business process flow to the app so we'll click on challenge process after that click on Save then click on publish after that's done we'll go back to the Innovation Challenge app screen and at the top we'll click on publish all customizations once you see the publish all customization succeeded notification you can navigate back to the apps tab here you should see the Innovation Challenge app that you have created and customized so click on that we'll need to enter in the challenges that were in the original Innovation Challenge app so click on new here we can see the form that we created in this same structure we have the business process flow the name description odor communicate via and so on just like the original so let's enter in some of the information the name is connected operations we'll give that a description and fill in all the other stuff after we've finished entering the information in and selecting the things we want we can click on Save in the top and once we go back we can see that a challenge has been added to the active challenges list we can choose to add more challenges and ideas to the model driven app to make it similar to the original app so as we mentioned earlier this is a simplified version of The Innovation Challenge app you can play around with the tables the forms views business process flows and create what you want to learn more hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering power automate in Greater detail so do you regularly download email attachments before uploading them to the database does the process of authorizing a new purchase order involve retrieving a form from a physical location for signatures do you have to manually visit a website daily locate the daily numbers and then transfer them to another system power automate is a solution that can help with these and other similar scenarios it is designed to enable computers to manage repetitive tasks with power automate anyone familiar with the business process can establish a repeatable sequence that executes the process when triggered common scenarios and capabilities of power automate automating repetitive tasks like transferring data between systems dieting a user through a multistage process connecting to external data sources using various connectors or an API automating desktop based and website processes with robotic process automation capabilities access to data is an important aspect of app development and power automate provides over 600 connectors to connect to data and services on the web or on premises some common data sources included Microsoft dataverse Salesforce Dynamics 365 Google Drive Office 365. Microsoft Power Platform easily supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into a single automation additionally power automate enables users to create custom connectors using a Swagger file to connect to any data source that is not covered by the existing connectors so those are the main values of using power automate there are several types of flows you can create with power automate power automate works by creating flows of which there are three main types cloudflows business process flows and desktop flows cloudflows these flows are created with a trigger in one or more actions and there are many triggers and actions available through connectors such as receiving an email or a social media mentioned they are categorized as my flows or team flows based on ownership with my flows being owned solely by the Creator and team flows having multiple odors create a cloud flow to automate a task that can be triggered automatically immediately or on a schedule automated flows these flows are triggered automatically when a specific event occurs in a connected application or service such as arrival of an email from a specific person or a mention of your company in social media instant flows these flows can be triggered manually by the user through the power automate mobile app the web interface or other methods for example instantly send a reminder to the team with a push of a button from your mobile device scheduled flows these flows run on a regular schedule or at specific times such as daily data upload to SharePoint or a database business process flows these flows are built to augment the experience when using model driven apps in Microsoft dataverse use these to create a guided experience in your model driven apps desktop flows these robotic process automation flows allow you to record yourself performing actions on your desktop or within a web browser you can then trigger a flow to perform that process for you you can also pass data integrate data out of the process letting you automate even manual business processes so these are the types of flows in power automate the next topic we'll be covering in power automate or cloudflow templates so a cloud flow template is a prebuilt workflow that automates a specific business process or task in power automate these templates are designed to be easily customized and deployed allowing users to quickly create and share automated workflows that meet their specific needs cloudflow templates are available for a wide range of use cases from simple data transfers between applications to complex business processes involving multiple steps and approvals users can browse and search for templates in the power automate interface or on the Microsoft Power Platform website and can also create their own templates to share with others you can choose from a collection of templates to find the one that best matches your company's scenario search all templates or Browse by category to find your scenario and then follow the steps in the template to create a cloud flow from the template some common use cases for cloud flow templates and power automate include wide approval workflows templates can be used to create automated approval workflows for documents contracts and other types of requests for example a template could be created that automatically sends a document to a manager for approval when it is uploaded to a specific folder two social media monitoring templates can be used to monitor social media platforms for mentions of a company product or brand this can help businesses stay up to date with customer feedback and respond quickly to any issues three data integration templates can be used to automate the integration of data from different sources for example a template could be created that automatically pulls customer data from a CRM system and adds it to a marketing automation platform for a vet management templates can be used to automate the management of events such as sending invitations tracking RSVPs and sending reminders five document automation templates can be used to automate the creation of documents such as contracts invoices and reports this can help businesses save time and reduce errors overall Cloud flow templates are a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide range of business processes improve efficiency and reduce errors hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering are the Microsoft power automate Concepts starting with actions and triggers power automate cloudflows use connector triggers and actions to automate tasks every flow has two main parts a trigger and what are more actions a trigger is an event that starts the workflow such as a new email arriving in your inbox a file being added to a folder or a new record Being created in a database triggers are used to initiate the workflow and determine when it should run an action is a specific task that is performed as part of the workflow such as sending an email creating a new item in a list or updating a record in a database actions are used to automate tasks and perform specific functions based on the trigger connectors are the bridge between the triggers and actions allowing them to communicate with other services and applications by using the appropriate connectors users can create powerful and complex workflows that automate a wide range of business processes connector triggers and actions are the building blocks of power automate Cloud flows allowing users to easily automate tasks and streamline their workflows some examples of types of actions you can have in a flow include Loops runs in action until conditions are met to move to the next step of the flow switch identifies a single case to execute based on the evaluation of input due until executes a block of actions until a specified condition evaluates to true apply to each executes a block of actions for each item in the input array Expressions underlying definition that describes the actual logic that runs in your flow that can be manually written you can also perform data operations in your flow such as compose create CSV table join or select these Concepts will come into play later when you build your own flows from scratch the next power automate concept we'll be covering in Greater detail or loops a loop in power automate is a control structure that allows you to repeat a set of actions for each item in a collection or until a specific condition is met Loops are useful for automating tasks that involve processing a large number of items or performing a set of actions repeatedly until a specific outcome is achieved the idea behind a loop is to make a desktop flow repeat one or more actions multiple times power automate implements the simplest type of loops with the loop action this Loop repeats the actions between the loop and end actions for a set number of times a loop index variable is created automatically to track the current iterations number there are four types of Loops available in power automate apply to each Loop this Loop allows you to process each item in a collection one at a time it is useful for automating tasks that involve processing a large number of items such as sending an email for each row in a SharePoint list do until Loop this Loop allows you to repeat a set of actions until a specific condition is met it is useful for automating tasks that require a specific outcome such as waiting until a file is available in a cloud storage service before continuing with other actions do while loop this Loop allows you to repeat a set of actions while a specific condition is true it is useful for automating tasks that involve checking for new data such as waiting for new emails to arrive in a mailbox for each Loop this Loop allows you to process each item in a collection based on a specific index or value it is useful for automating tasks that involve working with lists or tables such as updating records in a database these Loops are flexible and powerful and they can be combined with other actions and conditions to create complex workflows by using Loops you can automate repetitive tasks reduce errors and improve your productivity the next power automate concept we'll be covering is a switch in power automate a switch is a control statement that allows you to perform different actions based on the value of a specified input the input could be a string number or Boolean value the switch statement evaluates the input and Compares it to a set of defined cases if the input matches one of the cases the corresponding action is executed if there is no match a default action can be executed here is a simplified example suppose you want to automate an approval process based on the amount of a purchase request you could use a switch statement to check the value of the purchase request and perform different actions based on the amount for example if the purchase request is less than one hundred dollars send an approval email to the manager if the purchase request is between one hundred dollars and one thousand dollars send an approval email to the department head if the purchase request is more than one thousand dollars send an approval email to the CEO here is a simple visual of a switch layout so it identifies a single case to execute based on the evaluation of switch input you have a value that's passed through in case that checks to see if it matches if the case does match those actions are run however if there are no cases that match then the default cases run by using a switch statement you can simplify your workflow and reduce the amount of branching logic you need to write you can also easily add new cases as your business requirements change thank you hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be going through are conditions in power automate a condition is a control statement that allows you to test whether a specific condition is true or false and execute different actions depending on the result conditions are used to make decisions in your workflow based on the data that is being processed for example you may have a condition in your workflow that checks whether the value of a field in a SharePoint list is equal to a specific value if the condition is true the workflow might continue to The Next Step such as sending an email or updating another field in the list if the condition is false the workflow might take a different action such as terminating the workflow or notifying a user of the error power automate supports a variety of different conditions such as equals greater than less than contains starts with ends with and more you can also combine conditions using logical operators such as and or and not to create more complex conditions to use a condition in your workflow you typically add a condition action to your workflow specify the condition you want to evaluate and then specify the actions you want to take based on whether the condition is true or false using conditions in power automate allows you to create more intelligent and flexible workflows that can make decisions based on the data being processed and take appropriate actions based on those decisions foreign automate an expression is a Formula or a string of code that performs a specific operation or manipulation on data they are used to perform calculations manipulate text and evaluate conditions among other things Expressions can be used in various places within power automate such as within actions conditions or dynamic content for example you can use an expression to calculate a date based on the current date extract the substring from a text string or evaluate the result of a condition expressions in power automate uses syntax similar to that used in programming languages with functions operators and variables power automate provides a rich set of builtin functions that you can use in your Expressions such as string manipulation functions date and time functions and mathematical functions in addition to the builtin functions you can also create custom Expressions by combining multiple functions and operators to perform more complex operations expressions in power automate also support Dynamic content which allows you to reference data from previous steps in your workflow using expressions in power automate allows you to perform complex operations on your data and automate your workflows more efficiently by leveraging the power of Expressions you can create more flexible and robust workflows that meet your specific business requirements here are some examples of how Expressions can be used in power automate Dynamic email subject you can use Expressions to create a dynamic email subject line that includes data from your workflow for example you could include the name of the customer or the ID of the record that triggered the workflow date and time calculations you can use Expressions to perform calculations on dates and times such as adding or subtracting days or hours from a date this can be useful in scheduling workflows or setting reminders conditional actions you can use expressions and conditional actions to evaluate data and make decisions based on that data for example you could check if a value is greater than a certain threshold or if a string contains a specific word data Transformations you can use Expressions to transform data from one format to another for example you could convert a string to a number or a date to a string array manipulations you can use Expressions to manipulate arrays of data such as filtering sorting or joining arrays data validation you can use Expressions to validate Data before performing an action for example you could check if a field is blank or if a value is within a certain range foreign automate and approval is a type of action that allows you to send a request for approval to one or more individuals the approval action can be used to automate the approval process for various tasks such as expense reports time off requests or document approvals when an approval action is triggered a request is sent to the designated approver with the relevant information and options for approving or rejecting the request approvers can review the request and provide comments if necessary before making a decision once a decision is made the workflow can proceed to the next action based on the approver's response the approval action in power automate provides several customization options such as setting approval conditions adding custom messages or attachments and specifying escalation rules the approval action can also be integrated with other services such as Microsoft teams or Outlook to provide a seamless approval process within a familiar interface approvals actions actions are the events you want your flow to perform after the trigger starts the flow for example when a new item is added to a list created with Microsoft lists trigger and approval to have somebody review the new item this image shows the full list of approval actions that you can use in your flows there are four approval types you can use approve reject everyone must approve all approvers are given to auctions approve or reject a response is needed from each approver before the flow run is completed the actions that follow the start and wait for an approval action run after all the approvers respond or when a single rejection occurs approve reject first to respondent assigned approvers are given two options approve or reject approval or rejection by any approver completes the request the actions that follow the start and wait for an approval action run after any one of the approvers gives approval custom responses wait for all responses you define the options the assigned approvers can choose from all approvers must respond to complete the process custom responses wait for one response you define the options the assigned approvers can choose from a response from any approver completes the process so that's a general overview of approvals in power automate hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the use cases for power automate with some of Microsoft's popular services like Microsoft teams Outlook SharePoint and forms starting off with Microsoft teams automatically create teams and channels for new projects or teams send notifications to teams when new items are added to SharePoint or other apps automatically create a teams meeting from an Outlook calendar event using power automate set up a flow that automatically posts a message to A team's Channel when a new file is added to a OneDrive folder Outlook automatically create calendar events from emails or create emails from calendar events send automated emails based on specific triggers such as new leads or completed tasks save email attachments to OneDrive or SharePoint for easy access and collaboration automatically send an email notification when a new item is added to a SharePoint list using power automate SharePoint automatically create SharePoint list items from form submissions or emails send notifications when items are added or updated in SharePoint lists automate document approval processes and workflows such as document review and approval publishing And archiving automatically save attachments to SharePoint libraries and folders for easy collaboration and document management forms automatically create tasks calendar events or SharePoint list items based on form submissions send custom confirmation emails or approval requests based on specific form responses automatically create charts or dashboards based on form data to visualize responses and Trends use branching logic to customize the form experience based on specific responses such as showing or hiding specific questions or sections these are just a few examples of the many use cases for power automate with Microsoft teams Outlook SharePoint and forms Tower automate can be used to automate and streamline many different types of business workflows and can be customized to meet the specific needs of your organization foreign automate platform is accessible through various

processing tasks making them faster and more accurate these features enable users to streamline document workflows reduce errors and increase productivity hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is AI builder in power automate to take advantage of AI capabilities you must first build a model with AI Builder AI builder in power automate provides several types of prebuilt models that can be used for various purposes object detection this model can be used to detect and identify specific objects within an image form processing this model can extract key data from forms such as invoices receipts and surveys prediction this model can be used to make predictions based on historical data text classification this model can classify text into different categories sentiment analysis this model can analyze text to determine the sentiment of the text business card reader this model can extract key information from business cards such as name phone number and email language detection this model can detect the language of a text keyword extraction this model can extract important keywords from a text entity extraction this model can identify and extract key entities from a text these prebuilt models can be customized and trained to meet specific business needs or users can create their own models from scratch using AI Builders drag and drop interface foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we'll be showing you how to build a basic power automate flow so the first thing you'll want to do is to go to the power automate page at make.powerautomate.com here we are currently at the home page and it shows you all the things you can do like what would you like to automate and you can choose specific tasks that you want to quickly automate with a prebuilt template and on the left it shows a big list of things as well like approvals my flows create and so on what we're interested here are the templates because these are prebuilt templates that make our lives a lot easier most of the time there will be a scenario where power automate already has it created for you so you'll just have to enter a few fields for the trigger and actions and you'll be ready to go as you can see there are hundreds of templates available for you to fit your scenario there are various types of templates such as scheduled automated and instant some examples could be email automation approvals data collection and they can connect to other platforms like power bi teams Outlook and much more for this example we can try something simple like saveoutlet.com email attachments to your OneDrive so whenever you receive an email that has attachments in your outlook inbox it will also save those attachments in your OneDrive this can be useful in case you may forget something or you want to store important files in your OneDrive all of this is automated for you once you input a few fields of information we could also try something related to Microsoft teams for example we can search for teams something like send an email when a new message is added in Microsoft teams looks very simple and straightforward so this will send an email to whoever you select when a new message is added in teams this can be useful for alerting teammates that may not have access to teams at the moment or sending important messages that may be on teams but was not sent to your email so let's take a look at that for this flow we'll need to connect to our Microsoft teams account and our Office 365 Outlook I already have my account connected so I won't need to connect again but if it's your first time you'll probably need to connect to these apps click on continue so on the top area is the trigger which is when a new channel message is added here you'll need to select the team so this could be your sales and marketing team your development team or testing team and so on for this example we'll choose development and in this section we'll need to select the channel That the message is in so we'll choose emails the next part is your action so this sends the email you'll need to select who you want to send the email to for this section I will select my own email so Andrew Brown I could select someone else from the team but for this example I'll just leave it for myself this subject is new message on Microsoft teams Channel this should be finances is unless you want to change it up a bit you can customize the body however you like you can add Dynamic content which allows users to pass data between different actions in a flow making the flow more flexible and efficient users can extract data from various sources and use them as input to automate workflows without having to hard code them into the flow Dynamic content can include information such as email addresses file names dates and other data elements that can be passed between different actions in a flow so if we were to delete the message from we can simply add the dynamic content called message from user display name we won't have to change anything here since it's a simple automated flow next we'll click on Save and that's it your flow is ready to go you can go test this out by sending a message in the team's Channel and see if it sends you an email so I'm on my teams right now currently at the email Channel which is where I set up my automated flow to be here I'll type in something like this is a test after a moment we should receive the email at our Outlook so as you can see we have received the automated email from teams so the automated flow works great let's try to make another flow we can try to not use a template this time instead we'll start from blank so this is the trigger section where there are many to choose from we'll try something simple like when a file is created in one drive so click on that and click on create it's a very similar process to the previous method but here you have a bit more freedom so for the folder we'll select development and for the action we can choose whatever action we want and you can have as many actions as you need as well so we'll go with something email related like send an email let's search for email in the search bar and let's click on send an email so same thing as before we'll enter in the fields I'll send this to myself so Andrew Brown this is where Dynamic content is very helpful since the fields aren't filled in for you when you create it from blank the subject can be the file name and the body could be the file identifier you can give it a title if you want but the ones they generate for you are decent enough after that you just press save and this automated flow should be ready to use so this is pretty straightforward and helpful with automating repetitive tasks and much more hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering power virtual agents in Greater detail including its main features and components power virtual agents provides teams with a simple and intuitive way to create powerful chat Bots using a guided no code graphical interface without the need for technical expertise or coding knowledge it

opening hours and store information employee health and vacation benefits and common employee questions for businesses power virtual agencies available as both the Standalone web app and is a discrete app within Microsoft teams the next topic we'll be covering are the features of power virtual agents why to get started in seconds Tower virtual agents as a software is a service offering it allows you to easily sign up create your chat bot and embed it into your website with just a few clicks there is no infrastructure to maintain or complex systems to deploy to empower your subject matter experts using powered virtual agents you have full control your smes can create chat Bots quickly and easily using a novel intuitive code free graphical interface eliminating the need for AI expertise or teams of developers three enable Rich natural conversations Microsoft's Advanced conversational AI technology enables end users to engage in multiturn conversations that effectively and quickly guide them to the correct solution there is no need to retrain AI models simply provide a few examples of the topic you want the chatbot to handle utilize the graphical Editor to build the conversation and your chatbot will be ready to respond to customer requests Additionally the test pane feature allows you to preview and test any changes made in real time for enable chat Bots to take action chat Bots that can chat with your users are great but chat Bots that can act on their behalf are even better power virtual agents provides the capability to integrate with services and backend systems throughoutofthebox integration or via custom connectors that can be easily added through Power automate this makes it simple to create a chatbot that not only responds to the user but also acts on their behalf 5. Monitor and improve chatbot performance power virtual agents offers Advanced metrics and AI driven dashboards that enable you to monitor the performance of your chat Bots easily track which topics are successful and identify areas where the chatbot could improve allowing you to make quick changes to improve performance six Better Together power virtual agents and Dynamics 3cm 65 customer service insights work seamlessly together to provide a comprehensive perspective of your customer service operations by utilizing both platforms you can identify trending topics or support resource consumption and then easily automate those tasks foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the components of power virtual agents starting off with topics Empower virtual agents a topic defines how a chatbot conversation plays out you have the option to customize existing templates create new topics from scratch or use suggestions from existing help sites to develop these topics a topic has trigger phrases these are phrases keywords or questions that a user is likely the type that is related to a specific issue and conversation nodes these are what you use to define how a chatbot should respond and what it should do the AI leverages natural language understanding to interpret what a customer types and identify the most suitable trigger phrase or node for example if a customer types open hours into the chat bot the AI can match it to the store hours topic and initiate a conversation that asks which store the customer is interested in and displays the hours of operation for that store use system and Sample topics when you create a chat bot a number of topics will be automatically created for you for per populated user topics that are titled as lessons these lesson topics provide guidance on creating simple to complex chatbot conversations using nodes a number of system topics these are for populated topics that you are likely to need during a chatbot conversation they are recommended to be used until you are comfortable with creating an endtoend chatbot conversation you can edit both topic types in the same manner as for topics you create however you cannot delete them the next component of power virtual agents will be covering are entities Empower virtual agents natural language understanding plays a significant role in chatbot conversations by allowing the AI to understand a user's intent for example if a user says I'm having trouble using my gift card the chatbot can recognize the user's intent and direct them to the relevant topic about Gift Card issues natural language understanding involves identifying entities in a user's dialogue an entity represents a type of real world subject such as a phone number zip code city or person's name prebuilt entities power virtual agents provides a range of prebuilt entities that represent commonly used information in real world conversations such as age colors numbers and names these entities allow the chatbot to intelligently identify relevant information from user inputs and save it for later use custom entities while the prebuilt entities in power virtual agents cover frequently used information types there may be instances where you need to train the chatbots language understanding model with specialized knowledge that is specific to the chatbot's domain or purpose the next component of power virtual agents or actions by using Microsoft power automate flows you can enable your chatbot to execute actions such as automating activities or calling backend systems for example you can use flows with end user authentication to retrieve information about a user after they sign in you can call flows from within topics as a discrete call in action node you can utilize flows that have already been created in your powerapps environment where you can create a flow from within the power of virtual agents authoring canvas so that's a general overview of entities and actions in power virtual agents the next topic we'll be covering is publishing power virtual agents chat Bots power virtual agents allows you to publish chat bots on various platforms or channels such as websites mobile apps and messaging platforms like Microsoft teams and Facebook after you have published at least once you can connect your chatbot to additional channels any updates to your chatbot require republishing it from the power virtual agents app which will update the chatbot across all channels where you've inserted or connected your chatbot Additionally you can configure a power virtual agents chatbot to provide authentication capabilities so users can sign in with any oauth 2 identity providers such as Azure active directory a Microsoft account or Facebook steps to publish a power virtual agents chatbot why in the power of virtual agents portal navigate to the authoring canvas for the chatbot you want to publish to click on the publish button in the top right corner of the screen three on the publish page review the information provided including the version number and the changes that will be published for if you are satisfied with the information click the publish button at the bottom of the page five after the chatbot is published you can find the link to the chat bot on the Channel's page of the authoring canvas 6. to make the chatbot available on a specific Channel such as Facebook Messenger or Microsoft teams you will need to configure the channel in the power virtual agents portal and follow the instructions provided note that before publishing your chat bot you should thoroughly test it to ensure that it is working as intended and that it provides a good user experience you can test your chatbot using the testbot feature in the authoring canvas hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is how to make chatbot available in teams power virtual agents is a no code guided graphical interface solution that allows every member of your team to create Rich conversational chat Bots that easily integrate with the team's platform all content authored empowered virtual agents renders naturally in teams I.T administrators business analysts domain Specialists and skilled app developers can design develop and publish intelligent virtual agents for teams without having to set up a development environment they can create a web service or directly register with the bot framework to make your chatbot available in teams through the power virtual agents portal you must perform the following process steps why didn't publish the latest bot content after creating a chatbot in the power of virtual agents portal you must publish your Bot before teams users can interact with it two configure the team's Channel after publishing your Bot at the team's channel to make the bot available to teams users three generate an app ID for your chatbot after adding the team's channel to your chatbot an app ID is generated in the dialog box the app ID is a unique Microsoft generated identifier for your Bot save the app ID to create an app package for teens Additionally you can add your Bot to teams using developer portal which requires another set of instructions that won't be necessary for the exam hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next thing we'll be covering is how to create a topic perform the following procedure steps why in the navigation menu select topics two select new topic three if the trigger phrases pane does not automatically appear select it from the options to make it visible for provide one or multiple phrases that will activate the topic in the trigger phrases section you can specify more than one trigger phrase for a topic you can include punctuation in a trigger phrase but it's best to use short phrases rather than long sentences five select details to open the topic details pane 6. enter a name for your topic and optionally a display name and description the bot uses the display name when it needs to know which topic the person is asking about the description is not visible to users and is intended for explaining the objective of the topic to yourself and other bot Developers also to modify the name of the topic select its existing name and provide a new value and the seventh and last thing you'll need to do is to select save to add the topic to the topics list so these are the following steps to create a topic hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the latest addition to the Power Platform called
