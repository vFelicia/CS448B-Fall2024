00:00 - hey what's up welcome back to css3 in 30
00:03 - days this is day number six called print
00:05 - specific styles jump over here in my
00:07 - browser print specific styles what we're
00:09 - going to be doing is creating a print
00:11 - specific style sheet using media queries
00:15 - in css so that when you hit print in
00:18 - your browser when you print a web page
00:20 - you know you can do that you can
00:22 - actually style the print
00:24 - style sheet so that when you are
00:26 - printing out like a graphic heavy or a
00:28 - colorful you know
00:31 - web page like this one for example you
00:33 - don't get all of the colors and all the
00:34 - backgrounds and the borders and all of
00:36 - the web specific styles you don't want
00:38 - to see that on a piece of paper
00:42 - because it doesn't it won't show up or
00:44 - you'll waste a ton of ink so you can
00:46 - style that that print specific style
00:48 - sheet so that it looks great so let me
00:50 - show you the example so here is print
00:53 - specific styles if i go ahead and hit
00:54 - command p to print this you can see the
00:57 - preview look at how nice that looks it's
01:00 - all black and uh black and white there's
01:02 - no backgrounds there's no colors
01:04 - or images we got a little bit of color
01:06 - here in the links but check this out as
01:07 - well so all the things like
01:10 - you know the the graphics and the 3d you
01:12 - know text and all that stuff that's gone
01:16 - and it's replaced with something very
01:17 - minimal and readable
01:19 - and
01:20 - things like the rotations on the heading
01:22 - that's fixed that's all straightened out
01:25 - and check this out right after a link it
01:28 - actually shows
01:29 - the url because
01:31 - in the on the web you can say click this
01:33 - link and have it be linked up in html
01:36 - and you don't have to see the url you
01:37 - just click it because it's interactive
01:39 - but on a piece of paper it's not
01:41 - interactive you can't click it you need
01:42 - to know what the url is so you can
01:44 - actually display that and i'll show you
01:45 - how to do that in a moment so very very
01:47 - simple it's just a single page and you
01:48 - can print that out and it would actually
01:50 - look
01:51 - quite nice so why don't we jump in and
01:53 - do that
01:54 - head over here to your
01:56 - code editor i'm using adam and i opened
01:58 - up my number six print styles it has the
02:00 - index sandbox and final css for your
02:04 - reference and enjoyment go ahead and
02:06 - download those print styles the course
02:08 - files for today that is in this module
02:10 - you can go ahead click that uh module
02:12 - lesson you just get the idea by now you
02:14 - should know how to do that so number six
02:16 - print styles we're going to jump
02:18 - straight into the sandbox and start
02:20 - coding it up this is going to be a
02:21 - pretty straightforward lesson so
02:23 - let's go ahead and do that so first
02:25 - thing you need to do is you need to do a
02:26 - media query
02:28 - and you know when you're doing uh you
02:30 - know media queries you can do things
02:32 - like
02:33 - screen
02:34 - and you know um
02:38 - max width
02:40 - you know 900 pixels
02:42 - that's going to style
02:44 - screens like your iphone or your
02:46 - computer
02:47 - at a max of 900 pixels so this is how
02:49 - you do like a media query for responsive
02:51 - styles but we're not doing responsive
02:52 - styles we're actually doing media print
02:56 - so you can do a print style sheet
02:58 - so we're going to style everything
02:59 - within these parentheses here so let's
03:01 - go ahead and first things first let's
03:04 - hide some on unwanted elements
03:08 - and i'm just going to bang through them
03:10 - here so we're going to hide course files
03:12 - is the is the button that says download
03:15 - course files the big blue button we're
03:16 - going to hide that i'm going to go comma
03:18 - what else am i going to hide we're going
03:19 - to hide the logo which is in the footer
03:22 - we're going to hide the sandbox
03:26 - before so now you know i'll show you
03:28 - what i'm doing here if i go to the index
03:29 - file
03:31 - i'm hiding the course files because i
03:32 - don't want to see that this you're not
03:34 - going to need to click that on a piece
03:35 - of paper uh the things like
03:38 - the
03:39 - oh let me find it here
03:42 - sandbox uh actually the sandbox isn't
03:44 - even in this specific lesson we're just
03:46 - using final so final
03:49 - dash result
03:52 - before so if i go to my index here the
03:54 - final result we're actually styling
03:56 - something in the theme styles called
03:59 - before so if i go over here to my
04:00 - browser and show you
04:02 - you know how we did this 3d sort of
04:04 - effect here if i inspect this and show
04:07 - you
04:07 - basically this is what that looks like
04:10 - here
04:12 - we've got final result before so we
04:15 - styled that to have that you know sort
04:17 - of um
04:18 - 3d
04:20 - element we don't want to see that in a
04:22 - print style sheet so i'm hiding
04:24 - that so go back to css
04:26 - so final result before we're also going
04:28 - to copy that another comma and info
04:31 - before because we did the same effect
04:33 - there
04:34 - and final result after we also have that
04:38 - same style going on there the after
04:40 - pseudo element and info
04:44 - after
04:46 - what else do we have here i believe
04:48 - we're going to hide the images i don't
04:49 - want to see any images and i'm just
04:51 - going to say display none all gone just
04:54 - like that now basically maybe let's go
04:57 - check it out
04:58 - print
05:00 - all right so okay so everything is
05:02 - showing up for me because what's
05:04 - happening is we're hooking in the final
05:06 - css but we're trying to sell the sandbox
05:08 - so here go back to our code editor here
05:10 - in your index if you want to hide the
05:13 - final result all you're going to have to
05:15 - do here is final project css use for
05:17 - reference just comment that out if you
05:19 - want
05:21 - to hide the
05:23 - print styles so let me even just put a
05:25 - comment here
05:28 - so yeah comment this out if you want to
05:29 - hide the final styles so now let's go
05:30 - back to our browser if i hit refresh and
05:32 - then print command p
05:35 - i will see there we go so it's
05:37 - everything's still kind of styled
05:39 - uh in a
05:40 - in a basic way there
05:43 - some browsers will automatically remove
05:45 - things like backgrounds if i go to more
05:46 - settings i can like
05:48 - you know i can
05:49 - adjust the margins i can leave the
05:52 - headers and the backgrounds and the
05:53 - graphics so if i left that in
05:55 - basically it's just styling the web page
05:58 - as you can see that so let's go back
06:00 - here to our code editor in sandbox let's
06:02 - continue
06:05 - and now let's do the i'm going to call
06:07 - this the global
06:08 - typography
06:10 - reset and comment that make a comment
06:13 - there
06:15 - okay and now in the global typography
06:17 - reset what we're going to do is we're
06:18 - just going to select body and we're
06:20 - going to say font family i want to make
06:22 - it georgia georgia is a nice georgia and
06:24 - serif is uh
06:26 - people like reading serif typically on
06:29 - paper you read serif typefaces like in
06:32 - books whereas on the web sans serif is a
06:35 - pretty good um
06:36 - font i mean obviously you can there's no
06:38 - hard and fast rules but
06:40 - serif fonts are nice to read on paper so
06:43 - georgia is a good one
06:46 - font size we're going to say 16
06:49 - point which is kind of more of a print
06:51 - based
06:52 - measurement instead of pixels because
06:54 - we're not really using pixels on paper
06:56 - there's no pixels on paper so we're
06:58 - going to use points
07:00 - line height we're going to say 24 points
07:03 - background no backgrounds and then the
07:05 - color straight up flat black i'm going
07:07 - to say that let's keep going before we
07:09 - view it
07:11 - let's do a
07:13 - layout reset
07:16 - and i'm going to say final result
07:19 - info these are all classes by the way
07:21 - class info and then section html5
07:24 - element and footer we're going to say
07:27 - width 100
07:29 - because they have specific widths
07:31 - currently
07:32 - border no borders
07:34 - padding 0 margin 0 and color triple 0 as
07:38 - well because some of those elements have
07:40 - different colors so save that now let's
07:43 - view it and see what it looks like
07:44 - refresh command p to view
07:47 - all right so you can see that we're
07:49 - getting there it's pretty messy i mean
07:51 - if i use the default settings here and i
07:53 - just turned off background graphics then
07:56 - you can kind of see that it's already
07:58 - looking okay but let's leave that on so
08:00 - that we have to override it all right
08:02 - let's keep going
08:03 - let's go down to the
08:06 - uh keep going in the section uh the
08:08 - layout reset here we're gonna say
08:09 - section
08:10 - first child before
08:13 - uh that is the top border
08:16 - uh on the instructor that the in the
08:18 - section that says instructions i want to
08:19 - hide that i'm gonna say border none save
08:21 - that
08:22 - and
08:24 - now let me save that and check it out in
08:26 - the browser
08:27 - let me see what we have so far see if we
08:28 - were missing any sort of global styling
08:31 - okay so i don't want any backgrounds
08:34 - you know this stuff is hard to see
08:36 - i don't want to see that big logo up at
08:38 - the top i don't want any of these
08:39 - backgrounds
08:41 - so let's go
08:43 - back to the code editor and remove the
08:46 - backgrounds in these sections and
08:49 - remove this
08:50 - background logo so i want to hide this
08:54 - uh i believe it's in body and before so
08:57 - body before we want to remove that
08:58 - element altogether
09:01 - and what do we have the backgrounds and
09:03 - final result yeah backgrounds and
09:05 - sandbox final result info so go back
09:07 - here
09:09 - uh in layout reset i want to add
09:11 - background none
09:14 - and in fact background none is in there
09:15 - as well great so now body right after
09:17 - the global typography reset i'm actually
09:19 - just going to change this to say global
09:21 - reset and then body
09:24 - pseudo element before
09:28 - display none
09:30 - and let's actually move body before up
09:33 - to the to the hide unwanted elements
09:36 - so we don't even
09:38 - let's just do it right at the very top
09:40 - body before comma save that now let's
09:44 - see
09:45 - hit print
09:48 - all right we're getting there we're
09:50 - getting there
09:51 - what else do i want to hide i want to
09:52 - hide these tabs
09:54 - i don't want these tabs here so what are
09:55 - those those are
09:57 - final result i believe those are
09:59 - um
10:00 - h2s
10:02 - so we got body final result h2 yes
10:06 - i don't actually want to see those let's
10:08 - hide that as well
10:10 - so let's go
10:12 - final result h2
10:14 - and info h2 save that that should
10:19 - solve the problem let's uh let's have a
10:21 - look there we go those are gone so we're
10:23 - getting there you start you start to see
10:25 - that this is looking a little bit more
10:26 - like it needs to
10:27 - uh not perfect but let's keep going
10:31 - okay down to the bottom oh we've already
10:32 - done that now let's do some specifics so
10:34 - i'm going to say
10:36 - specifics
10:39 - and we're going to say h1 2 3 4 5 and 6
10:42 - and we're going to straight up say color
10:43 - triple zero to override any styles there
10:45 - font size 24 points
10:48 - line height give it some line height of
10:50 - 30 points and margin no margins and now
10:52 - let's do even more specific
10:55 - we're going to say h1 we're going to
10:57 - style that one to the font size
11:01 - 50 points
11:03 - margin 0 0 20 points
11:06 - text align center
11:09 - width 100
11:11 - transform oops transform
11:16 - rotate
11:17 - zero because it's currently going to
11:18 - rotate and we don't want to see that
11:20 - and then let's style the small
11:23 - h1 uh h1 small tag within there we're
11:26 - going to say font size 24
11:29 - points
11:30 - we're going to say color triple 8
11:32 - a little bit lighter than black margin
11:35 - 0 0 10 points
11:38 - okay
11:39 - and let's uh save that and check it out
11:41 - one more time over here refresh hit
11:44 - print what do we got
11:45 - looking better already day6 print
11:47 - specific styles the small is right there
11:50 - this is large they got margins at center
11:52 - beauty beauty beauty
11:53 - all right
11:54 - now what do we got so let's go back here
11:57 - to this to the style sheet sandbox
12:00 - right after h1 small let's go ahead and
12:02 - select the a
12:04 - link we want these links to be
12:07 - to have no margins
12:09 - and let's do a
12:11 - after pseudo element this is where we're
12:13 - going to add the text of the url so this
12:15 - is how we do that we say content
12:18 - and then we open uh some strings here
12:21 - and in that first
12:23 - string set of strings a space and then a
12:25 - square open square
12:28 - bracket
12:29 - outside of the string attribute
12:31 - we're going to select the href
12:35 - and then a space after that open and
12:37 - close another set of strings and then
12:39 - close
12:40 - the square bracket and then close to the
12:42 - semicolon
12:43 - and then let's just do one last thing
12:45 - here we're going to say footer a
12:47 - link
12:49 - and footer
12:51 - a
12:53 - visited
12:55 - we're gonna go color triple zero
12:57 - and then background none save that let's
13:00 - go over here refresh hit print see what
13:03 - we've got
13:04 - this is looking pretty good
13:07 - uh i see that there's some weird padding
13:08 - around this link and i know that we had
13:10 - padding because we had those little
13:11 - pop-up boxes in the footer and this text
13:13 - is too gray i want it to not be gray i
13:15 - want it to be
13:16 - black so let's go here we're going to
13:18 - say padding zero in fact in all the
13:22 - links we're just gonna say padding zero
13:24 - maybe that will solve the problem then i
13:26 - want the text within all of these
13:29 - sections
13:31 - color zero i'm just gonna say important
13:33 - on that to override any styles let's see
13:35 - what we've got refresh print
13:39 - okay so
13:40 - the the padding on the links didn't
13:42 - change and that didn't change all right
13:44 - let's find out why so i'm gonna select
13:47 - this
13:48 - inspect it
13:51 - and i'm going to
13:52 - what do we got footer a link
13:54 - padding
13:56 - so i'm gonna have to over
13:57 - be more specific there yep and this text
14:01 - why is it not overriding info p okay go
14:04 - back over here i'm gonna actually change
14:07 - this
14:08 - remove that and i'm gonna say
14:12 - down here under h1 small i'm gonna say
14:15 - info
14:16 - p
14:18 - and i'm gonna say color triple zero
14:20 - and
14:22 - this should this should be padding zero
14:25 - and a link doesn't need padding that
14:27 - should do it save head over to the
14:28 - browser do a refresh and a print
14:33 - and we should have our final print
14:36 - specific style so now if i change here
14:37 - in the settings and do backgrounds and
14:39 - graphics it should really just all it's
14:42 - modifying is the day number six it wants
14:44 - to be darker which is fair
14:46 - in fact why don't we just change that
14:47 - right now let's go h1 small let's just
14:49 - change this to triple zero and that
14:52 - should do it back to the browser
14:54 - refresh print
14:56 - and there we go we've got our print
14:58 - specific style sheet if i change these
15:00 - settings now it really shouldn't do
15:02 - anything at all beautiful those are the
15:04 - print specific styles great work now
15:07 - what you can do is you can take these
15:08 - styles add them to your own websites
15:10 - your own blogs applications client sites
15:12 - whatever it is and just go to any random
15:14 - page and hit command p and
15:17 - go to print it out and see what the
15:18 - preview looks like and you can see if
15:19 - they have a style sheet for print or not
15:21 - and on your own websites you can go
15:23 - ahead and add some print style sheets so
15:25 - that if for some crazy reason your
15:27 - grandfather wants to print out your
15:29 - website
15:30 - he'll be able to read it properly on his
15:32 - good old-fashioned piece of paper
15:34 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days this is day number six called print specific styles jump over here in my browser print specific styles what we're going to be doing is creating a print specific style sheet using media queries in css so that when you hit print in your browser when you print a web page you know you can do that you can actually style the print style sheet so that when you are printing out like a graphic heavy or a colorful you know web page like this one for example you don't get all of the colors and all the backgrounds and the borders and all of the web specific styles you don't want to see that on a piece of paper because it doesn't it won't show up or you'll waste a ton of ink so you can style that that print specific style sheet so that it looks great so let me show you the example so here is print specific styles if i go ahead and hit command p to print this you can see the preview look at how nice that looks it's all black and uh black and white there's no backgrounds there's no colors or images we got a little bit of color here in the links but check this out as well so all the things like you know the the graphics and the 3d you know text and all that stuff that's gone and it's replaced with something very minimal and readable and things like the rotations on the heading that's fixed that's all straightened out and check this out right after a link it actually shows the url because in the on the web you can say click this link and have it be linked up in html and you don't have to see the url you just click it because it's interactive but on a piece of paper it's not interactive you can't click it you need to know what the url is so you can actually display that and i'll show you how to do that in a moment so very very simple it's just a single page and you can print that out and it would actually look quite nice so why don't we jump in and do that head over here to your code editor i'm using adam and i opened up my number six print styles it has the index sandbox and final css for your reference and enjoyment go ahead and download those print styles the course files for today that is in this module you can go ahead click that uh module lesson you just get the idea by now you should know how to do that so number six print styles we're going to jump straight into the sandbox and start coding it up this is going to be a pretty straightforward lesson so let's go ahead and do that so first thing you need to do is you need to do a media query and you know when you're doing uh you know media queries you can do things like screen and you know um max width you know 900 pixels that's going to style screens like your iphone or your computer at a max of 900 pixels so this is how you do like a media query for responsive styles but we're not doing responsive styles we're actually doing media print so you can do a print style sheet so we're going to style everything within these parentheses here so let's go ahead and first things first let's hide some on unwanted elements and i'm just going to bang through them here so we're going to hide course files is the is the button that says download course files the big blue button we're going to hide that i'm going to go comma what else am i going to hide we're going to hide the logo which is in the footer we're going to hide the sandbox before so now you know i'll show you what i'm doing here if i go to the index file i'm hiding the course files because i don't want to see that this you're not going to need to click that on a piece of paper uh the things like the oh let me find it here sandbox uh actually the sandbox isn't even in this specific lesson we're just using final so final dash result before so if i go to my index here the final result we're actually styling something in the theme styles called before so if i go over here to my browser and show you you know how we did this 3d sort of effect here if i inspect this and show you basically this is what that looks like here we've got final result before so we styled that to have that you know sort of um 3d element we don't want to see that in a print style sheet so i'm hiding that so go back to css so final result before we're also going to copy that another comma and info before because we did the same effect there and final result after we also have that same style going on there the after pseudo element and info after what else do we have here i believe we're going to hide the images i don't want to see any images and i'm just going to say display none all gone just like that now basically maybe let's go check it out print all right so okay so everything is showing up for me because what's happening is we're hooking in the final css but we're trying to sell the sandbox so here go back to our code editor here in your index if you want to hide the final result all you're going to have to do here is final project css use for reference just comment that out if you want to hide the print styles so let me even just put a comment here so yeah comment this out if you want to hide the final styles so now let's go back to our browser if i hit refresh and then print command p i will see there we go so it's everything's still kind of styled uh in a in a basic way there some browsers will automatically remove things like backgrounds if i go to more settings i can like you know i can adjust the margins i can leave the headers and the backgrounds and the graphics so if i left that in basically it's just styling the web page as you can see that so let's go back here to our code editor in sandbox let's continue and now let's do the i'm going to call this the global typography reset and comment that make a comment there okay and now in the global typography reset what we're going to do is we're just going to select body and we're going to say font family i want to make it georgia georgia is a nice georgia and serif is uh people like reading serif typically on paper you read serif typefaces like in books whereas on the web sans serif is a pretty good um font i mean obviously you can there's no hard and fast rules but serif fonts are nice to read on paper so georgia is a good one font size we're going to say 16 point which is kind of more of a print based measurement instead of pixels because we're not really using pixels on paper there's no pixels on paper so we're going to use points line height we're going to say 24 points background no backgrounds and then the color straight up flat black i'm going to say that let's keep going before we view it let's do a layout reset and i'm going to say final result info these are all classes by the way class info and then section html5 element and footer we're going to say width 100 because they have specific widths currently border no borders padding 0 margin 0 and color triple 0 as well because some of those elements have different colors so save that now let's view it and see what it looks like refresh command p to view all right so you can see that we're getting there it's pretty messy i mean if i use the default settings here and i just turned off background graphics then you can kind of see that it's already looking okay but let's leave that on so that we have to override it all right let's keep going let's go down to the uh keep going in the section uh the layout reset here we're gonna say section first child before uh that is the top border uh on the instructor that the in the section that says instructions i want to hide that i'm gonna say border none save that and now let me save that and check it out in the browser let me see what we have so far see if we were missing any sort of global styling okay so i don't want any backgrounds you know this stuff is hard to see i don't want to see that big logo up at the top i don't want any of these backgrounds so let's go back to the code editor and remove the backgrounds in these sections and remove this background logo so i want to hide this uh i believe it's in body and before so body before we want to remove that element altogether and what do we have the backgrounds and final result yeah backgrounds and sandbox final result info so go back here uh in layout reset i want to add background none and in fact background none is in there as well great so now body right after the global typography reset i'm actually just going to change this to say global reset and then body pseudo element before display none and let's actually move body before up to the to the hide unwanted elements so we don't even let's just do it right at the very top body before comma save that now let's see hit print all right we're getting there we're getting there what else do i want to hide i want to hide these tabs i don't want these tabs here so what are those those are final result i believe those are um h2s so we got body final result h2 yes i don't actually want to see those let's hide that as well so let's go final result h2 and info h2 save that that should solve the problem let's uh let's have a look there we go those are gone so we're getting there you start you start to see that this is looking a little bit more like it needs to uh not perfect but let's keep going okay down to the bottom oh we've already done that now let's do some specifics so i'm going to say specifics and we're going to say h1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and we're going to straight up say color triple zero to override any styles there font size 24 points line height give it some line height of 30 points and margin no margins and now let's do even more specific we're going to say h1 we're going to style that one to the font size 50 points margin 0 0 20 points text align center width 100 transform oops transform rotate zero because it's currently going to rotate and we don't want to see that and then let's style the small h1 uh h1 small tag within there we're going to say font size 24 points we're going to say color triple 8 a little bit lighter than black margin 0 0 10 points okay and let's uh save that and check it out one more time over here refresh hit print what do we got looking better already day6 print specific styles the small is right there this is large they got margins at center beauty beauty beauty all right now what do we got so let's go back here to this to the style sheet sandbox right after h1 small let's go ahead and select the a link we want these links to be to have no margins and let's do a after pseudo element this is where we're going to add the text of the url so this is how we do that we say content and then we open uh some strings here and in that first string set of strings a space and then a square open square bracket outside of the string attribute we're going to select the href and then a space after that open and close another set of strings and then close the square bracket and then close to the semicolon and then let's just do one last thing here we're going to say footer a link and footer a visited we're gonna go color triple zero and then background none save that let's go over here refresh hit print see what we've got this is looking pretty good uh i see that there's some weird padding around this link and i know that we had padding because we had those little popup boxes in the footer and this text is too gray i want it to not be gray i want it to be black so let's go here we're going to say padding zero in fact in all the links we're just gonna say padding zero maybe that will solve the problem then i want the text within all of these sections color zero i'm just gonna say important on that to override any styles let's see what we've got refresh print okay so the the padding on the links didn't change and that didn't change all right let's find out why so i'm gonna select this inspect it and i'm going to what do we got footer a link padding so i'm gonna have to over be more specific there yep and this text why is it not overriding info p okay go back over here i'm gonna actually change this remove that and i'm gonna say down here under h1 small i'm gonna say info p and i'm gonna say color triple zero and this should this should be padding zero and a link doesn't need padding that should do it save head over to the browser do a refresh and a print and we should have our final print specific style so now if i change here in the settings and do backgrounds and graphics it should really just all it's modifying is the day number six it wants to be darker which is fair in fact why don't we just change that right now let's go h1 small let's just change this to triple zero and that should do it back to the browser refresh print and there we go we've got our print specific style sheet if i change these settings now it really shouldn't do anything at all beautiful those are the print specific styles great work now what you can do is you can take these styles add them to your own websites your own blogs applications client sites whatever it is and just go to any random page and hit command p and go to print it out and see what the preview looks like and you can see if they have a style sheet for print or not and on your own websites you can go ahead and add some print style sheets so that if for some crazy reason your grandfather wants to print out your website he'll be able to read it properly on his good oldfashioned piece of paper
