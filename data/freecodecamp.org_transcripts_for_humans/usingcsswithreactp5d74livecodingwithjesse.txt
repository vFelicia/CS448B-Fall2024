00:07 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:09 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna
00:12 - get back to doing some stuff with react
00:14 - components specifically we're gonna
00:17 - style some things so I know for the last
00:20 - week or so we've been working with my
00:23 - sequel databases and cloud storage and
00:27 - setting all that up which was really
00:30 - really cool learned a lot about that but
00:33 - I haven't actually done any react in a
00:36 - while so I'm excited to get back to it
00:39 - and hey everybody see some some hellos
00:45 - in the in the chat and just as I guess
00:54 - an update from yesterday so decided not
01:00 - to go with the basically like setting up
01:05 - a cname or an a record to work with that
01:08 - Google Cloud Storage so right now what
01:12 - I've been doing is trying to set up the
01:16 - my sequel database to work with
01:20 - WordPress running on now so that's what
01:22 - I was just doing just made an export of
01:27 - the database from WordPress and I was
01:31 - about to import it into our cloud sequel
01:34 - database but I think I'm gonna put that
01:36 - on hold and we're gonna do some styles
01:39 - and then I'll come back to that later on
01:42 - after that I'll need to set up our
01:46 - WordPress URL to go to the right place
01:50 - instead of our digitalocean droplet and
01:53 - then we should be all good to go with
01:56 - with WordPress and that'll be our
01:58 - production ready WordPress deployment
02:06 - some weird stuff going on outside my
02:08 - office this is just checking it out all
02:13 - right let me get my other screen ready
02:15 - and then I'll switch over the view so
02:18 - that you can see it all as well we will
02:27 - mostly be in Visual Studio code
02:41 - we bring this up first place will be
03:04 - all right cool I think everything is set
03:07 - up and should be working fine
03:16 - there we are okay so this is the main
03:19 - website should be pretty familiar to
03:21 - everyone at at this point and I was just
03:28 - finishing up a Pomodoro session so
03:30 - that's how much time I have left almost
03:32 - got the full session in and we're gonna
03:35 - go today we're gonna look at a few
03:39 - different pages and see like what what
03:42 - styling needs done and we'll we'll just
03:50 - kind of go from there and see what you
03:53 - know what we can do so here's one thing
03:56 - that my guest
03:59 - yesterday noticed so we had a kind of a
04:06 - guest on the show towards the end of
04:08 - yesterday's show named Haley and she's
04:11 - gonna help out with the site I'm hoping
04:13 - to hire her on as a contract worker so
04:15 - I'm gonna try to get all the details
04:17 - figured out today so she can start but
04:20 - she noticed here that we have you know
04:25 - this this length it's just playing a
04:27 - plane length right it's got the
04:29 - underline it's got the blue everything
04:31 - it it doesn't really like match right I
04:35 - mean it has the right font at least but
04:38 - it's a little weird that is just there
04:40 - in this case the title actually makes
04:43 - sense right it's we can tell it's a CV
04:45 - right at curriculum vitae but some of
04:48 - the other file names don't make any
04:50 - sense so we definitely should style this
04:55 - a bit differently and let people know
04:57 - what it is so this is this is what we're
05:04 - gonna work on first and it is going to
05:06 - take a bit of CSS but we're also going
05:10 - to potentially need to do some stuff
05:14 - with JavaScript as well so that's first
05:18 - up let me set my timer there we are
05:25 - and let's get to it so this is let's
05:31 - make it bigger so don't need that I was
05:36 - sort of limit plan and we don't need
05:38 - this right now and we don't need this
05:42 - all right let me know if that flan is
05:46 - big enough for everyone if you're just
05:50 - joining us for the first time I just set
05:52 - a Pomodoro timer and so we're gonna code
05:54 - for about 25 minutes when that timer
05:56 - goes off I'm going to go back to the
05:57 - live chat and I'm going to answer your
05:59 - questions so if you do have any
06:00 - questions please put them in the chat
06:02 - now and I will get to them in about 25
06:05 - minutes
06:09 - alright so very simple with this
06:11 - component I'm gonna just describe this
06:14 - hopefully said even if you don't know
06:16 - react you'll know what's going on we all
06:19 - our data is stored in WordPress we're
06:22 - using the WordPress AP app while we're
06:25 - using graph QL to pull in the data and
06:29 - we're bringing that data in and we're
06:31 - basically just displaying all of it in a
06:34 - div on the page up here we're changing
06:38 - the data a little bit there's some
06:41 - things in there that just don't work for
06:44 - us right now so we're changing that data
06:47 - so here we're we're changing the data I
06:50 - think we need to I think we need to
06:53 - change a little bit about that
06:59 - curriculum vitae
07:01 - let's see harsh it says it's not
07:03 - readable and mobile art I'll make it
07:04 - bigger
07:05 - hopefully that's better and I think if I
07:08 - go any bigger it's going to be a little
07:10 - hard to to see it enough to actually do
07:13 - anything let me show you what the
07:17 - mark-up looks like and that way we can
07:21 - come up with a plan on how to edit that
07:31 - so I'm just going to inspect this in
07:33 - chrome dev tools and it's really small
07:37 - so I'm gonna make this bigger okay so we
07:47 - see here the link is contained inside
07:50 - this CV link element and then we just
07:56 - have an a tag and we have our file and
08:01 - the title there so this is going to be
08:05 - add straightforward to some of the other
08:07 - adjustments that we made that are
08:10 - already present in the component but
08:13 - this is what we need to target right the
08:16 - a tag within the CV link so let's let's
08:23 - try to do that so we were using regular
08:30 - expressions here to find what we wanted
08:35 - and then we're just replacing that I'm
08:38 - not sure that that's gonna work for us
08:41 - now at least not in the same way so the
08:48 - problem is like I can definitely target
08:53 - this and this will be the same across
08:55 - all of these pieces of data for these
08:59 - faculty profiles but I target this and
09:03 - then I still need to I need to at least
09:13 - get this this href right so I guess
09:22 - a truth
09:30 - all right my people out there who know a
09:34 - little bit more about regular
09:36 - expressions let me know what you think
09:38 - of this I'm gonna tell you what I want
09:40 - to do but I'm not exactly sure how to do
09:42 - it so let's let's work that out so
09:44 - here's what I'd like to do I'd like to
09:47 - potentially find this section basically
09:50 - CV link a href equals and then this
09:55 - first quotation mark and then grab
10:01 - everything up until that second
10:06 - quotation mark I want to grab that and
10:10 - then insert it into a template literal
10:13 - and then put that inside the CV link so
10:20 - I think that'll be the best way then
10:23 - what I'll do is just change the title of
10:26 - this to curriculum vitae something like
10:33 - that and so everybody will have a link
10:35 - that just says curriculum vitae so it'll
10:39 - all be standard will style the link to
10:42 - so they know like there won't be a
10:46 - million different you know names for
10:48 - each professors curriculum vitae so no
10:51 - matter what the file name is that they
10:52 - upload it'll say the same thing but I do
10:56 - still need to know what this with this
11:01 - href is pointing to so
11:10 - let's see I'm gonna see what you all are
11:15 - saying about this right now michael says
11:22 - can't you do CB link first child John
11:32 - says find CV link and change it to html5
11:35 - details element will probably be the
11:38 - only of this type and style the tag a
11:41 - tag under details I'm not necessarily
11:46 - worried about the styling because that's
11:48 - going to be I can just style the the CV
11:53 - link directly would I basically I need
12:01 - somehow to grab this value inside the
12:05 - href if I can get this whoops if I can
12:08 - get this value then I'm fine but I just
12:12 - need a way to get this value only this
12:14 - value in it the only information that
12:17 - I'll have across all the pieces of
12:22 - content that we'll have for faculty
12:25 - profiles is this CV link so I need to
12:30 - grab the HR value inside the a inside
12:32 - the CV link if this was back in my
12:35 - jQuery days this would be easy but it's
12:37 - not
12:38 - and essentially remember we're not
12:39 - dealing with like the Dom here at this
12:43 - point this is just a string coming
12:45 - through so we're still dealing with this
12:49 - content as a string right it gets set as
12:55 - you know HTML here but we can't use like
13:00 - normal at least if we're going to make
13:06 - the change before it actually hits the
13:07 - page we can't actually I just had an
13:12 - idea
13:12 - okay so
13:21 - we can't I really hate to do this
13:24 - because it's react but alright here's an
13:28 - alternate plan what if we just let the
13:32 - data go to into the Dom as is then
13:37 - afterwards so like I don't know after
13:40 - the components mounts or whatever then
13:43 - we do some stuff to manipulate it while
13:45 - it's in the Dom would that be easier
13:50 - could we just go in at that point find
13:53 - the a SAG within the CV link element and
13:58 - then just change the text and would that
14:07 - mess up
14:08 - reiax ability to track what's going on
14:15 - would that also mess up our server-side
14:18 - rendering would the server-side
14:19 - rendering be off from what's on the
14:23 - client-side okay so our should say and
14:28 - that would work Nikki's saying you just
14:32 - want to do it in component did him out
14:37 - okay
14:45 - all right well let's we can try it I
14:48 - think for me at least because I'm not an
14:52 - expert at all in regular expressions I
14:57 - think it might be easier to try the
14:59 - second way but I'm still open to the
15:02 - first way all right so let's let's see
15:12 - let's assume I guess we can we can do
15:16 - some work here in the console actually
15:19 - so let's go in here the console is clear
15:22 - all this out it's a document elements a
15:31 - tag name and then let's say see the is a
15:38 - CV link is that what it was
15:40 - let's see if we can grab it yep so we
15:42 - have CV link we can get that if you have
15:50 - our CV link and we have our inner HTML
15:56 - in our inner text yes all right how
16:00 - about this the shudders
16:09 - you know text equals no it didn't it
16:22 - didn't actually change it shoot I need
16:31 - to get more space here let's let's open
16:34 - this up
16:44 - all right so I can change it here but it
16:50 - doesn't actually update in the dawn see
17:04 - okay harsh it says
17:15 - it won't mess up as that part is not
17:18 - frequently re-rendered okay all right
17:23 - cool awesome Michael I think your ear I
17:29 - think you get the right idea that CV
17:32 - link let's try this
17:37 - oops what was I thinking why don't I do
17:40 - this yeah yes okay that's what we need
17:51 - all right cool but it's not it actually
17:59 - changed everything in there okay so this
18:04 - is not exactly what we want let's see
18:10 - let's look at this structure a little
18:16 - bit more text content I think that's
18:19 - what might work better out of HTML out
18:23 - of it
18:30 - and it says hmm it looks like there's a
18:36 - lot that we we kid tried it's argued
18:38 - here let's try something else then let's
18:40 - refresh the page and try something else
18:43 - so it looks like we can we could try
18:46 - text content or we could try outer text
18:53 - I'd rather not have to mess with the a
18:55 - tag at all right so let's refresh so
19:03 - want to get the original the original
19:06 - stuff back here we'll inspect this again
19:09 - and then all right so let's check it out
19:19 - instead of inner text what was I I say
19:23 - we were gonna do it was a text content
19:38 - okay let's see if this works it equals
19:44 - it still takes a lot okay we'll have to
19:47 - get hard saying use query selector
19:50 - Michael's saying could we try CV links
19:53 - here yeah let's let's try that so let's
19:56 - say see what we get if we put a zero in
20:03 - here
20:04 - undefined okay you know all right so
20:12 - Harshit that's a great idea so hard
20:15 - saying we could do document dot query
20:20 - selector and then do CV link a shoot
20:30 - it's not working oh no wonder it's not
20:37 - working I just took it out of the page
20:41 - all right now let's try one more time CV
20:44 - link a yes
20:45 - okay so we have CV like a and let's try
20:47 - to go what was it inner text let's try
20:55 - to change that inner text yes and does
21:01 - this work it does we're getting the
21:04 - right nice alright so that's what we
21:07 - need to use so let's copy that
21:16 - and let's go over here and let's add a
21:26 - component it mounts and let's try to do
21:34 - is like a query selector equals you see
21:44 - me we'll save you CV
21:47 - [Music]
21:49 - see if that works
21:50 - we'll save it so this is let this be a
21:54 - lesson to everyone my my mistake so when
22:00 - you don't take the time to learn how to
22:03 - select things in Dom with vanilla
22:06 - JavaScript plain JavaScript and you just
22:08 - rely on jQuery all the time you don't
22:11 - remember all of these selectors so you
22:15 - all were giving me the names right
22:18 - luckily I also had dev tools that was
22:20 - Auto completing stuff for me so I could
22:22 - see what it was but if we were working
22:27 - with jQuery I would know automatically
22:29 - how to do that and I would have done it
22:30 - in you know a minute it would've been
22:32 - easy right so that's awesome if I always
22:35 - get to work with jQuery but I don't
22:37 - in fact I rarely use jQuery at all
22:40 - anymore and I know how to do a lot with
22:43 - react but when it comes to stuff like
22:45 - this I don't have that background
22:47 - knowledge of of it
22:49 - I assume it's possible but I always have
22:53 - to look it up so it slows me down so I
22:55 - appreciate all the help there but
22:58 - starting out sometimes you for me at
23:01 - least I I know like I would look at
23:03 - stuff like this and say it's so much
23:05 - easier to do a jQuery I'm just gonna use
23:07 - jQuery right and I never took the time
23:10 - to learn that
23:11 - so there's value in taking the time to
23:14 - learn that like this is always going to
23:16 - work but the jQuery will only work if
23:20 - you're using jQuery right and you
23:24 - there's not really a guarantee that
23:25 - you're always going to have that of
23:27 - so just just a note if you're thinking
23:32 - like I did that this is just way too
23:34 - much typing to do something that you
23:37 - don't have to type as much to jQuery
23:38 - there's definitely a time for this
23:41 - alright so I know enough about that
23:43 - let's see if it actually works
23:47 - refresh okay re it does work there's a
23:52 - little flash which is not is not
23:56 - unexpected there's a small flash of the
24:00 - original content so I'll say this at
24:08 - this point essentially we've done what
24:10 - we wanted to do with that I don't like
24:13 - that there's a little flash it's not the
24:18 - end of the world but that's where I
24:22 - think that the regular expression
24:25 - solution that I talked about first would
24:28 - probably be the better solution because
24:31 - we would never get that flash of content
24:38 - so I guess what I'm gonna do and I'm
24:44 - gonna do this right now and that way for
24:49 - those of you who aren't quite familiar
24:51 - with git and get up this might be
24:54 - helpful to you we will go to see that
25:01 - yeah we're gonna go here and I'm gonna
25:03 - open up an issue right and that way this
25:09 - will be good for two reasons one I won't
25:11 - forget about it but then also this is
25:12 - going to be there for anyone that would
25:14 - like to tackle this issue and will say
25:17 - this
25:24 - jeez
25:32 - all right so we're just gonna leave a
25:34 - little a little issue right so if
25:44 - anybody wants to try to tackle it and
25:46 - they're good with regular expressions
25:47 - they can try to you know fix that I
25:50 - shouldn't say fix it
25:52 - but fix it in what I think will be a
25:54 - better way right they'll solve that
25:56 - problem in a better way so
26:13 - all right so right now and the faculty
26:16 - j/s components this is probably hard to
26:19 - see as a man so right now in the faculty
26:22 - jazz component this text is changed
26:34 - components it mouths
27:00 - there we go so that's just a really
27:02 - basic amount of info it does say what
27:06 - what component to look in so I think
27:10 - this would be OK for now potentially I
27:12 - could add some screenshots and things
27:14 - like that
27:15 - I'm not since I'm streaming right now
27:16 - but I mean the more information you can
27:19 - add to an issue the more it would help
27:20 - someone who wants to actually solve that
27:22 - issue and we can give it a label as well
27:24 - and we can say help wants it and now
27:37 - everyone will know hey like this is up
27:40 - for grabs
27:41 - let's submit this issue okay and you
27:47 - know maybe someone's interested maybe
27:49 - someone's not let me check my time and
27:56 - before we go on all right about two
27:58 - minutes this is enough time to do some
28:01 - basic CSS stuff just to see like what
28:05 - we'd want to do so when we're doing CSS
28:07 - I think it's always a great idea to do
28:10 - your initial stuff in the end F tools so
28:15 - let me get rid of my console area here
28:18 - and I'm gonna push this out so we have
28:22 - as much space as we can because really
28:24 - what I want to get to is is this portion
28:26 - here so on this a tag that's what we're
28:32 - gonna focus our Styles so what we want
28:34 - to do is get rid of that line so we're
28:37 - gonna do text-decoration:none okay right
28:46 - and that just got rid of that line for
28:48 - us and I definitely want the color to be
28:52 - something different so we're gonna
28:54 - change that color and I I want it to be
28:58 - the same color that we've been using for
29:00 - links elsewhere
29:05 - and let me let me find where we have
29:10 - that color and do we not have it
29:14 - anywhere in this place I thought we'd
29:18 - have it somewhere all right let me open
29:22 - up a new a new little window here so I
29:24 - can find where that color is since I
29:26 - can't remember what the the hex code is
29:30 - pretty sure that we have it here oh
29:38 - there it was I skipped over it so this
29:41 - is the color we've been using for links
29:43 - let's inspect grab the hex code there we
29:47 - go I knew we were using something that
29:50 - would be difficult to remember so we did
29:52 - change it up a little bit use the hsla
29:55 - instead of just a normal hex color color
30:04 - there we go so that's much cleaner I
30:08 - think to just have it there because it's
30:13 - a different color you know it may invite
30:15 - users to click if we wanted it to stand
30:18 - out more if we thought maybe that was
30:24 - really like important we could make
30:28 - maybe the font weight a bit bigger we
30:31 - could even think about making it a
30:33 - button but I mean the words view CV
30:36 - seemed to invite a click right
30:40 - so in general I is for something like
30:43 - this this is not really an action that I
30:45 - want users to take I'd rather make it
30:47 - subtle but clear if I really really
30:51 - wanted users to click on that CV I would
30:53 - probably make it a button and I would
30:56 - make it stand out so that as soon as you
30:58 - see that page like you that button is
31:01 - right there
31:03 - so I think this will be okay my timer
31:06 - did just go up so I'm going to take a
31:10 - short break we do a five minute break
31:11 - and then we'll come back and we'll
31:12 - transfer those Styles over into probably
31:17 - a CSS file
31:19 - for this particular component and I'll
31:21 - explain why we're going to do it like
31:22 - that when we when we come back for our
31:25 - second Pomodoro session so right now I'm
31:28 - going to scroll up to the top of the
31:29 - chat try to answer as many questions as

37:25 - questions
37:40 - who aim high seer yeah I I haven't seen
37:45 - you here in a long time I was it going
37:46 - how's the the job going you don't have
37:49 - to tell me on the chat if you don't want
37:51 - to but send me a DM or something and let
37:54 - me know I'm interested to see how it's
37:56 - to know what's you know what's going on
37:58 - with that Dutchess is here good morning
38:09 - thanks for watching
38:14 - harsh it only has two days left for the
38:16 - summer holidays so will you have you
38:23 - have a lot less time then after the
38:24 - holidays harsh it
39:02 - and Ezekiel says this is the best day
39:04 - ever in my life
39:06 - is that because the new freakout cam
39:09 - stuff came out lucifer says hi hey how's
39:14 - it going
39:26 - [Music]
39:27 - Luke kesh says can anyone explain how to
39:31 - set up a basic react app with an express
39:33 - server project without something like
39:37 - create react app or gas fee I want to do
39:40 - that on cloud base I des like glitch is
39:48 - intended the truth dive I don't know
39:50 - that I've ever setup react without using
39:53 - something like next or create react app
39:58 - I think I use Gatsby once so yeah I
40:03 - don't I'm not the person to talk to
40:05 - about that just because I always I never
40:09 - really had a use case where it would be
40:11 - valuable for me to do it like that but
40:14 - I'm I'm sure you know probably some of
40:16 - the other people with a chat have done
40:17 - it like that I like to asked if the this
40:26 - method that we ended up going with is
40:27 - more reliable than the regular
40:29 - expression I don't know about reliable
40:33 - to be honest with you I would think the
40:36 - method that we used is probably less
40:39 - reliable I mean they're they're both
40:47 - it's probably gonna work but the fact
40:51 - that there's a delay between like the
40:56 - Dom loads the user actually sees this I
40:59 - don't know that makes me a little bit
41:01 - nervous so I think for this use case
41:05 - either one would work but I would
41:07 - definitely feel more comfortable with a
41:09 - regular expression way of doing it but
41:14 - sometimes it's just like you make it
41:16 - work and then if you have time like you
41:19 - can go back and do it but on a project
41:22 - this big it just doesn't make sense for
41:23 - me to spend a ton of time on small
41:28 - details like this at least not before
41:33 - launch like after launch I couldn't go
41:37 - like work out all these details but if I
41:39 - try to do all the details now like the
41:41 - site won't launch for you know months
41:43 - and months Michael says I didn't realize
41:48 - you could use multiple tags in query
41:50 - selector I usually cascade them I didn't
41:53 - realize you could either but that's
41:55 - really really helpful I'm going to take
42:11 - a drink before we start our next session
42:29 - okay I didn't get through everything in
42:35 - the chat so I will have to pick up where
42:37 - I left off and when we come back
42:39 - but now let's do some CSS and where's my
42:46 - timer there we go let's set this we'll
42:48 - probably just do one more Pomodoro
42:50 - session and then I got to get back to
42:55 - spending the rest I have so much to do
42:57 - today actually if you excuse me for a
43:00 - second let me just vent for a second on
43:02 - air so I'm giving a talk this weekend at
43:04 - Pittsburg tech fest on basically setting
43:07 - up what we've been doing here for the
43:08 - last few months
43:10 - react with WordPress as the content
43:12 - management system using graph QL I
43:17 - wanted to do videos so that I could set
43:20 - tell people at my talk like if you want
43:22 - to know more in depth check out the
43:23 - videos because I think I only have a
43:24 - half an hour so obviously I'm not gonna
43:27 - go step-by-step through this whole thing
43:28 - I didn't haven't made the videos yet
43:31 - like well obviously we've done it on the
43:33 - live stream but I'm not gonna tell
43:34 - people like hey go watch on a 100 plus
43:38 - hours of the live stream just for this
43:40 - project so I need to work on that I have
43:46 - a little bit of work to do for client
43:49 - like realistically it'll probably take
43:50 - me 15 minutes to do the client work but
43:52 - it's still like it's something else on
43:55 - my mind that has to be done by tomorrow
43:57 - at in tomorrow morning and then I sell
44:02 - both this work right for this site so
44:04 - there's still data that needs to be
44:05 - brought over both to the database and to
44:11 - the google cloud storage bucket so a lot
44:15 - I haven't done any work out today which
44:19 - may not seem like a big deal to you but
44:23 - for like mental health purposes if I
44:26 - don't get workouts in for a few days in
44:28 - a row like I will definitely feel
44:29 - depressed so while I'm still feeling
44:32 - upbeat I need to get that workout in if
44:35 - I wait til tomorrow
44:37 - I'm afraid like I will just not be up
44:40 - for it
44:40 - and it'll probably be a downward spiral
44:41 - for a few days so alright then over just
44:46 - wanted to share that with you all let's
44:48 - get back to this all right so I like
44:55 - this let's take this now which why did I
44:59 - do that let's grab this and I'm going to
45:03 - copy this not really that much to type
45:07 - out but I'm not gonna remember that to
45:09 - type it out and let's go over here and
45:12 - see first of all do we have styles yes
45:15 - we do we have a faculty CSS file that we
45:19 - can use and that's awesome so let's put
45:22 - it in there and as we're putting that in
45:25 - there I'm gonna explain why we're using
45:27 - this instead of styles inside of our
45:31 - component which we've done on some other
45:33 - components so in within our project we
45:41 - have a static folder and styles and then
45:44 - there that's where all our CSS files are
45:48 - okay so let's go down yeah I'm just
45:54 - gonna put this down here
45:56 - and we'll go see the link a and then
46:02 - we'll paste those in save it and let's
46:11 - refresh and make sure that it'll work
46:14 - yep there we go our styles are there and
46:20 - we can verify here yep the styles are
46:23 - there it's coming from our faculty CSS
46:25 - file great here's what we did it like
46:28 - that the the content that we're bringing
46:34 - in that we want to style right we're
46:37 - bringing it in from WordPress as a
46:39 - string and then we're adding it to the
46:43 - Dom here right so
46:51 - there's no there are no elements present
46:54 - within this component as it is now where
46:57 - I could just put a style on there like
46:59 - in line or where I could add a class to
47:03 - to let's say if I did all the Styles up
47:06 - here is like a JavaScript object you
47:09 - know I couldn't add that as we've done
47:11 - in other components right because those
47:13 - essentially like those elements that are
47:15 - ending up on the page don't even exist
47:17 - at that point so what we end up having
47:22 - to do then is kind of do it the
47:24 - old-fashioned way where we put in this
47:28 - this head tag here with a link to our
47:32 - CSS file as we move forward and clean up
47:38 - this data and pull it in as I really
47:41 - want to do it you know the best way that
47:43 - I know how we can phase this out and we
47:47 - can start putting all our Styles inside
47:51 - our component either as inline Styles or
47:54 - as JavaScript object
47:56 - all right then everything can be truly
47:58 - like modular right and reusable we can
48:02 - get rid of the CSS files for now of
48:05 - posts now that we have in WordPress of
48:08 - custom posts which I've shown you all
48:13 - before it's just it's too much so that's
48:15 - why we're doing it this way if if I
48:18 - could I would do it differently but
48:20 - there's not really anything wrong with
48:22 - doing it like this it does just get to
48:25 - be a bit of a mess we have so many
48:26 - different CSS files for a different
48:29 - component some components we have styles
48:34 - going on in three different ways we have
48:36 - inline styles in the component we have
48:38 - styles in a JavaScript object in a
48:40 - component and then we have styles in a
48:42 - CSS file that gets pulled into the unit
48:45 - so we don't have a lot of consistency in
48:49 - our CSS right now but that's that's a
48:53 - known issue it's it's what we have to
48:56 - work out now it's kind of like an
48:57 - in-between step to get this thing
49:00 - running
49:01 - but eventually
49:04 - we will this will be in better shape you
49:08 - know once we have more time but right
49:10 - now a lot of people are expecting this
49:13 - site to launch so in terms of what the
49:16 - user will see they'll never know the
49:19 - difference when we switch all this over
49:21 - it'll be the same for them so it's only
49:23 - going to be from the standpoint of
49:25 - developers and how easy it is to figure
49:27 - out what's going on and and you know
49:29 - contribute edit the files that'll be a
49:32 - lot nicer once everything is you know
49:35 - organized properly and in terms of you
49:39 - know all the data like how we're pulling
49:41 - it in okay so let's move on you check
49:48 - the time yeah let's move on we'll do a
49:52 - quick scan at this page and just say
49:54 - look over here I think it looks I mean
49:59 - the rest of this page looks alright
50:02 - there's nothing that stands out in ink
50:05 - when it comes to styles there's always
50:07 - more you could probably do but right now
50:10 - I'm not looking for that I'm looking for
50:12 - is there something that looks really
50:13 - weird on this page that looks maybe
50:15 - broken or something like that so from
50:18 - that point of view I don't see anything
50:20 - right so let's go let's see let's just
50:27 - check page we'll just go down through
50:29 - and check some pages just really quickly
50:32 - I mean look broken actually I did see
50:35 - something so let's go to device and
50:41 - let's try this pixel to see what it
50:46 - looks like this is not good all right so
50:51 - we have this split here so I noticed
50:55 - this yesterday when I was looking at
50:59 - this on a phone so let's try that out we
51:04 - try to fix that and see wow that's just
51:09 - hanging out there right so it's we have
51:11 - an h2 tag
51:15 - then an image and then right below that
51:18 - we just we just have the text so the
51:22 - image is actually within the h2 that's a
51:25 - little odd you usually don't see that
51:27 - but that's what we have to work with
51:29 - right now so ideally what we want to do
51:32 - is if we can keep the markup exactly the
51:35 - same and just use CSS that's ideal that
51:38 - takes the least amount of time for us if
51:40 - we have to adjust the markup we want to
51:43 - do that within the component using
51:45 - regular expressions or like we just did
51:48 - you know with a bit of JavaScript
51:50 - because that saves us from having to
51:53 - manually edit it if both of those things
51:54 - are impossible which we haven't really
51:56 - come across that yet but if they were
51:57 - impossible that would mean we'd have to
51:59 - go back manually edit all that stuff in
52:01 - a bunch of places you don't want to have
52:03 - to do that so let's try the first thing
52:05 - CSS let's see what we can do so we're
52:10 - gonna have to put the styles on the h2
52:12 - tag itself and I'm gonna make this
52:16 - bigger since you know we're dealing with
52:18 - this small viewport so we can make this
52:22 - a lot bigger we already have our h2 here
52:25 - so already putting some Styles on here
52:28 - in the department dot CSS file so let's
52:32 - see just wrap I'm not really sure what's
52:37 - it what to do here word wrap all right
52:44 - so we have break word that looks
52:46 - terrible as well so I'm not I'm not
52:49 - gonna go with that maybe let's put
52:53 - something on this image how about that
52:55 - let's see wow it has inline Styles on it
52:59 - already so that's getting pulled in
53:02 - float:right
53:11 - let me know what your thoughts are on on
53:14 - this image but here's what I'm thinking
53:18 - what if we go with
53:27 - left and let's do
53:41 - let's take out this height 100% take out
53:45 - the height
53:46 - [Music]
53:55 - now is this gonna I want to see how this
54:00 - looks up here actually I know this
54:02 - that's way too big great we don't want
54:16 - don't want it that big all right how
54:19 - about let's refresh the page reset it
54:23 - and let's go with we on the image
54:39 - you may just need to go with a media
54:41 - clear here
54:43 - Oh John Hanson is saying
54:47 - white-space:nowrap John is he's also
54:50 - saying how does that even happen image
54:52 - nested in an h2 should not even render
54:54 - yeah but this is the mark-up that we've
54:59 - inherited so we got to work with it
55:03 - at least for a little while alright so
55:09 - let's try I'll get rid of that let's see
55:12 - what John said white-space:nowrap
55:20 - and let's go back to this maybe I need
55:30 - to put that on the h2
55:39 - oh not Lucas just try a fixed height
55:54 - with auto width okay you try that Nicki
56:07 - says doesn't make it so that CSS isn't
56:08 - global and only for that page
56:10 - yeah yeah so each page has its own CSS
56:15 - file all right so that's not it's not
56:22 - gonna work at least not like as is but
56:26 - let's go down to this image and see if
56:28 - we can
56:53 - mmm-hmm let me see some of the other
56:56 - things I mean it's resized and soon
57:04 - all right
57:08 - let's let's reset again and alright
57:14 - let's assume to make this simpler let's
57:18 - assume that we're going to use a media
57:20 - query so we only have to deal with the
57:22 - mobile size so let's figure out where
57:25 - that query needs to be so we'll figure
57:27 - out exactly where this starts looking
57:29 - really weird right here so let's make
57:33 - that media query at about 500 pixels
57:36 - just to make it a nice even number so
57:38 - that we can remember so at about 500
57:40 - pixels then we're going to do this
57:53 - we're gonna get rid of the float
58:15 - and let's go with cities are our let's
58:18 - go with eight pixels Auto actually I
58:27 - don't really like that being centered
58:28 - let's let's get rid of the margin and
58:31 - margin Auto and let's just go with the
58:34 - margin of eight pixels all around so I
58:42 - like now you know what I don't even like
58:44 - that let's go with the margin of eight
58:48 - and zero all right that looks a lot
58:57 - better like and by better I don't mean
59:03 - ideal right not perfect but it doesn't
59:05 - look like it's broken now alright so
59:07 - basically here's what we've done and
59:10 - this is only gonna apply when it's under
59:12 - 500 pixels right because let's just see
59:14 - like this is what it would look like
59:15 - when it's over not terrible but it
59:18 - definitely doesn't look as good we have
59:20 - all this white space right that's not
59:23 - that's not better than what we had
59:25 - before where you had a nice wrapping
59:26 - effect so for under 500 pixels we're
59:32 - going to get rid of the float we're
59:35 - gonna add a margin of 8 pixels top and
59:38 - bottom right because we need a little
59:39 - bit of that space here up at the top
59:41 - it's fine we already have some space but
59:44 - I'm putting the 8 there just in case you
59:47 - know if if let's say I come back in and
59:49 - do different things with this facing I
59:52 - don't have to worry about it being too
59:53 - close so but we do want at least 8
59:58 - pixels of space between here you know
60:00 - potentially even more you know that
60:02 - still might be a little close but we got
60:05 - our mounting this is on a smaller screen
60:07 - so we don't want to have a ton of space
60:10 - that's going to increase the amount of
60:11 - scroll and then we set it to display
60:16 - block right that's what finally kind of
60:18 - pushed this down
60:20 - from where it was so let's put this now
60:30 - in our department dot CSS file and we're
60:37 - going to have to use important because
60:40 - this is on the element
60:43 - hopefully this alert that's on the
60:48 - element alright let's see if it works
60:54 - yeah so we need to be able to override
60:58 - these inline Styles right that are right
61:02 - there coming through like from the data
61:04 - that we're pulling in alright so let's
61:08 - find our toys are static static static
61:15 - Department
61:16 - don't see it so we are using Department
61:19 - dot CSS I guess we'll just continue to
61:21 - use that technically this isn't a
61:23 - department page but let's let's do it
61:27 - and let's go with inch this is h2 yeah I
61:37 - guess I'm okay with this
61:43 - it's we'll put this on the h2 image yeah
61:47 - so this will only work on images that
61:49 - are in an h2 tag which is fine I'm
61:51 - hoping that that's a rare occurrence
61:54 - so let's go h2 image forgot I'm not
62:02 - using sass all right we got to do the
62:03 - media query first at media and media
62:12 - screen and max with this is 500 reset
62:24 - 500 pixels what did i do what did I mess
62:30 - up
62:31 - nothing right this works and whoops and
62:35 - then we need to say h2 image we'll add
62:41 - that in there and we also need to do
62:43 - floats what we want to do float none
62:51 - yeah none let's just verify that that
62:54 - works yep so we're gonna do floats none
62:57 - and we're gonna put important on there
63:02 - we don't normally want to use important
63:05 - right so in this case though we have to
63:10 - because the the mark-up is really
63:12 - forcing us to because I'm not going to
63:14 - be able to override inline styles
63:16 - without using that I'm just going to go
63:21 - ahead and throw it on each one of these
63:22 - it might not be necessary on everyone
63:30 - but since we're already using it there's
63:33 - not really that much value in messing
63:36 - around and and potentially not having
63:40 - ourselves work so let's see if this
63:42 - works
63:43 - refresh okay awesome so that works we
63:47 - can see these styles are being
63:49 - overridden but the real test is was this
63:53 - work yep that works awesome so you can
63:56 - see we don't have all that whitespace
63:57 - once again probably not how I would make
64:00 - this page if I was doing it from scratch
64:02 - but now it won't look broken and not
64:07 - only that hopefully every other page
64:09 - that's using that CSS file that has an
64:12 - image inside an h2 tag will now be fixed
64:18 - all right cool let me check my time
64:21 - three more minutes let's see if we can
64:27 - find something to squeeze in here in
64:28 - there's three minutes also I'd like to
64:32 - see like are we having similar issues
64:35 - Wow so this is going float respect
64:44 - that's not a great image like I I
64:46 - normally like the image of the San
64:49 - Damiano crucifix like we used it in the
64:50 - catechol Institute website that was
64:52 - project one and it looked amazing but
64:54 - with this background color it doesn't
64:57 - stand out so I'm definitely gonna at
65:00 - some point probably try to replace that
65:02 - image but for now that's the image that
65:06 - we have so this is an image within an h1
65:10 - tag Wow okay and it is using Department
65:14 - CSS so let's let's do the same thing
65:18 - that we just did but let's also add in
65:20 - h1 tags so within here let's just go
65:27 - with each one image and h2 image are
65:33 - gonna have the same same styling we'll
65:36 - see
65:37 - that will do a refresh and we'll see
65:39 - okay that's on this side and then but
65:42 - when it gets bigger we still have the
65:44 - effect that we want all right great
65:47 - I think that looks better you know not
65:53 - perfect but much better than having it
65:55 - flow to the right all right awesome
66:00 - we've got about a minute left not really
66:04 - confident I can get anything else done
66:05 - in a minute but let's see new info
66:08 - coming soon employment HR wonderful all
66:15 - right that page actually looks like
66:17 - there's no change needed faculty opening
66:23 - nope and that page doesn't work I have a
66:29 - list of all the pages that don't work so
66:31 - I am aware of them all academics
66:36 - undergraduate this page yeah this face
66:40 - is actually okay we can go did we
66:44 - already check these out we did some
66:46 - styling work on these pages this is kind
66:49 - of weird so we have different font with
66:53 - our font font weights I mean they're
66:58 - different font weights going on a lot of
67:01 - different font weights and sizes
67:02 - happening here so it could probably use
67:06 - some cleanup at the very least if like
67:09 - this text we're just all the same I
67:11 - think that would be better but that'll
67:15 - be I have to save that for a different
67:17 - time this will end up being an easy fix
67:19 - though but my timer is running out I am
67:25 - curious to see why it's doing this mmm
67:29 - okay so these have some inline styles
67:32 - that are overriding what we have here so
67:35 - really if we just went with you know
67:41 - something like using important for the
67:45 - styles that are likely already there
67:48 - those P tags then I think that that
67:51 - would work so for instance we could just
67:57 - important here and this should override
67:59 - it right so now we have the proper line
68:02 - height and then I'm not sure where yeah
68:09 - so the font should be Roboto font family
68:16 - but that's all the way on main so we're
68:19 - bought a saying say San serif should be
68:21 - important to interesting but that's not
68:36 - hmm yeah so we may have to go ahead on
68:39 - the P tags and put in font family Roboto
68:48 - important right that would fix it see so
68:54 - not not really a difficult fix here so
68:58 - and this is a major CSS but like really
69:03 - this is something that could probably be
69:06 - used like across the board this is
69:08 - standard for P tags so they may want to
69:14 - make some sort of global style so we
69:16 - don't repeat it all over the place
69:22 - I kind of think that font is a little
69:24 - small - I mean it's 18 pixels but maybe
69:27 - it's just my screen okay now I'm gonna
69:31 - go back to the live chat and answer as
69:33 - much as I can also let's let's go ahead
69:36 - and push these changes to github get
69:43 - status so we can see we've changed
69:47 - faculty a Dodge is our department dot
69:51 - CSS and faculty dot CSS so let's do a
69:55 - git add and yarn CM let's do a feature
70:03 - and let's just say styles for CV link
70:14 - and images and header tags heading
70:29 - okay that works no breaking changes it
70:33 - does not affect open issues it's going
70:35 - to run all the linting all the Auto
70:37 - formatting all the tests and then it
70:39 - will commit after that assuming
70:41 - everything passes all right so while
70:43 - that's doing its thing I will answer
70:47 - some questions and then I'll make sure
70:50 - that I push this up to github so that
70:51 - you all can check this out if you want
70:53 - oh that was fast
70:55 - awesome so now I just do get push and
70:57 - everything is now available on github
71:00 - well now it is
71:18 - I'm just trying to find where I left off
71:21 - okay let's see now
71:31 - I should ask can anyone help make an
71:35 - awesome card component for the UI
71:37 - library that I am working on alright so
71:42 - let her should know how I should I would
71:45 - love to help you make a card component
71:46 - but I don't think I'll have time for
71:49 - sure not this week or weekend so I guess
71:54 - it depends on how soon you want it done
71:56 - but if I can I'll try to help
72:08 - John says have you not been using
72:11 - therefore your CSS colors no I haven't I
72:15 - haven't I really I should I should use
72:19 - CSS variables
72:50 - Nietzsche says did the new curriculum
72:51 - finally launch nice yeah it looks like
72:54 - it
73:10 - John says it can be helpful if the link
73:13 - text that isn't an obvious link to load
73:17 - with a subtle but obvious animation like
73:20 - color scale translator transform when
73:22 - the element comes as well yet now I
73:26 - don't have it up there yeah you're right
73:28 - you know maybe it might not be a bad
73:30 - idea for all links to I don't know if
73:33 - this is exactly what you're talking
73:34 - about but now that you said that it kind
73:37 - of makes me think you know potentially
73:39 - maybe there should be some sort of
73:40 - animation on hover for a link other than
73:43 - just the cursor you know the typical
73:46 - course or pointer I would want it to be
73:51 - subtle something just like a very slight
73:53 - shift in in color maybe just in the
73:57 - maybe a little lighter or a little
74:00 - darker nothing nothing too crazy
74:16 - that Duchess is this is really in
74:19 - comment to someone else in the chat Matt
74:21 - duchesses only game minecraft once in a
74:23 - while I just stood out to me cuz I
74:28 - really like Minecraft I got my my oldest
74:31 - son into it actually
74:32 - all my kids except for the baby or into
74:34 - Minecraft its they love it even like my
74:39 - three-year-old wants to play Minecraft
74:41 - he gets him so stuck in in like holes
74:43 - and needs help to get out but he likes
74:47 - to run around and and like dig get
74:51 - skeletons and stuff but anyway I don't
74:56 - know anybody else a Minecraft fan out
74:58 - there like you can you spend a lot of
75:01 - time in Minecraft and just get lost in
75:03 - that that world but uh I think it's a
75:07 - fun game
75:24 - Aniki says new livestream idea Jesse
75:26 - gets free code camp certifications
75:29 - actually that would be fun
75:32 - that would be really so if it ever
75:34 - happens that I can't livestream my
75:37 - actual work projects like I don't know
75:39 - if it happens he it probably won't
75:42 - happen here but like let's say I have to
75:44 - get it done another job for whatever
75:45 - reason and I can't then maybe that would
75:47 - be a great idea for a stream to do like
75:50 - all the free code camp projects live
75:55 - that would be fun although like I
75:59 - already have so many side project ideas
76:01 - to do as well so I could definitely work
76:05 - on those too
76:11 - Nicola ass is this website only
76:13 - front-end no so we're doing everything
76:16 - for it for this particular stream today
76:20 - we were just working with front-end
76:21 - stuff but in previous streams and in
76:24 - future streams you know we were working
76:26 - with back-end which is node but we also
76:30 - have WordPress setup and we build PHP
76:33 - plugin for that and got cloud sequel
76:36 - database cloud storage like we're
76:40 - working on a lot of a lot of stuff so
76:43 - kind of a larger project and so I think
76:48 - there's there's something for everyone
76:50 - in this process a
77:10 - Nietzsche says is there a reason that
77:12 - you import that stylesheet and the head
77:14 - tag instead of just importing the CSS
77:16 - file is that an XJS thing or is it
77:19 - server-side rendering thing to be honest
77:22 - with you I don't remember why we did it
77:23 - that way
77:24 - I just vaguely remember that we had to
77:26 - do it that way and that I did try to do
77:28 - it a different way
77:29 - but I really can't recall I mean it's
77:33 - probably on a stream but I don't
77:35 - remember when that that happened so yeah
77:42 - I really don't remember what it could be
77:47 - that I could do it another way and then
77:49 - I just didn't figure that way out and
77:51 - this one worked so I went with it but I
77:54 - can't remember
78:13 - this scrub scrub I don't know how to
78:18 - pronounce skru BYZ says no love for
78:23 - flexbox and that was probably when we
78:25 - were doing the image thing so I like
78:28 - flexbox but we just were having to deal
78:30 - with floats already set like we brought
78:33 - this content over from an older system
78:36 - and that's how how they were doing it so
78:40 - we're just kind of dealing with what we
78:42 - have
78:53 - let's see Aniki says the what frequency
78:56 - in a code review of that stuff you have
78:59 - to work with would be off the charts
79:03 - yeah I'm like I'm so used to it it
79:08 - doesn't really surprise me that much so
79:10 - when I see this but it's it is pretty
79:13 - wild though I mean it keeps it fun like
79:16 - surprising like it's really it's cool
79:20 - like like wow I've never seen that
79:23 - before I mean that's that's kind of fun
79:26 - that I've been doing this for years and
79:28 - years and it's like I still see stuff in
79:32 - websites that I've never seen that in
79:34 - terms of the markup like haven't seen
79:37 - that before that's cool it's just
79:41 - amazing what will actually work in a
79:43 - browser you know like you can you can do
79:46 - crazy stuff with a markup and it still
79:48 - actually renders
80:46 - michael creo says do you run lighthouse
80:49 - audits on your sites i was thinking
80:50 - about accessibility yeah I recently ran
80:53 - an audit on on this site that we're
80:56 - working on and I actually got a decent
80:58 - accessibility score so that's going to
81:00 - be something that we will be working on
81:02 - it may be I'm not exactly sure if it'll
81:08 - be pre or post launch when we do a lot
81:10 - with that because realistically like
81:14 - even this site as is is a huge
81:16 - improvement over the the current web
81:19 - site so I think it's even if we don't
81:22 - have perfect accessibility score it's
81:25 - still gonna be more accessible I want to
81:28 - double check that to verify but I'm
81:30 - pretty sure it is still be more
81:31 - accessible so I think as an incremental
81:33 - step launching this would be good and
81:35 - then we can try to work towards being
81:38 - like fully accessible so but it is
81:43 - coming it's something that is definitely
81:47 - on my mind and I think it's important so
81:50 - that I not I hope hopefully would love
81:54 - to do work on that during a stream go
81:58 - through the whole process - of using
81:59 - lighthouse I don't know if everybody
82:00 - knows what it is or how to use it but it
82:03 - might be cool to do a whole stream just
82:05 - on going lighthouse and trying to fix
82:07 - all the stuff that can get our scores up
82:11 - thanks for bringing that up
82:22 - Jeff says I have a minecraft server
82:24 - running at home cool
82:27 - med that just says cool I fall off in
82:29 - love a lot
82:31 - then log like I hate that I mean you get
82:35 - your character they all build up and you
82:37 - have the sweet armor and stuff and like
82:39 - no enemies can take you out and then you
82:41 - just mess up and fall in love at once
82:43 - and you're done anyway
83:02 - oh cool you know what I've never tried
83:04 - to do anything with servers like playing
83:06 - online with servers on minecraft I
83:07 - always because my kids are playing it I
83:09 - was like I'm just gonna let you play
83:12 - this offline and it'll be safe but maybe
83:15 - like if I'm supervising I could get try
83:19 - that out because that's a whole like
83:21 - part of the game that seems really cool
83:23 - that I've never experienced without my
83:26 - minecraft by the way
83:38 - Zuber says hi i disconnected from your
83:42 - Shing for a while is this still
83:43 - university project any plans for
83:45 - starting a new project from beginning
83:47 - then oh yeah we definitely will this is
83:49 - so the university project we for sure
83:52 - have have new projects coming up so it
83:56 - will start one from beginning to end
83:58 - here I can't tell you for sure when that
84:01 - will happen but it will definitely
84:04 - happen I'm sure my bosses have lots of
84:08 - stuff lined up for me after I launched
84:10 - this site
84:34 - mate it may seek says can you show what
84:39 - you did already create the website yeah
84:42 - you know what let me let me show you
84:45 - this site but then also so this I'll
84:48 - just show you the home page there's
84:49 - likes way too much to show the whole
84:51 - site but I can give you the link as well
84:53 - so I'm gonna type that into the live
84:56 - chat here now okay so I just put the
85:06 - link in the live chat if anybody would
85:08 - like to go to the site check it out
85:10 - you'll feel free let me know if you've
85:13 - got any ideas for making it better or if
85:16 - you if you see something that's like for
85:18 - sure broken please let me know anyway
85:22 - but you know just kind of really briefly
85:24 - here's the home page you know one thing
85:28 - I was thinking about for accessibility
85:30 - is I don't really know if this text is
85:33 - readable enough like for a person with
85:35 - like good vision it's okay but if
85:38 - somebody doesn't have great vision I'm
85:42 - not really sure like I I'm thinking
85:44 - about maybe doing something I mean I
85:47 - like this image and yeah I don't know
85:52 - what I'm gonna do about that but that's
85:54 - something I'm not I've been thinking
85:55 - about lately you know about maybe doing
86:00 - something with it
86:13 - John Hanson says mistakes in HDL markup
86:16 - get rendered in the Dom only because the
86:19 - dome sees the mistakes and bandages them
86:22 - on the fly not like PHP that's cool I
86:26 - mean it's I know it's good and bad right
86:29 - it could it can encourage people to
86:30 - write their markup in ways that aren't
86:33 - the best you can write markup in ways
86:36 - that are let's say entirely unaccessible
86:38 - to screen readers and things like that
86:40 - and it'll still work and so unless
86:43 - people get away with that but at the
86:44 - same time it makes it really easy to
86:47 - build websites even if they're not great
86:49 - websites you can so I don't know I guess
86:54 - their pros and cons to that duchesses
87:00 - yeah I wanted to see accessibility and
87:02 - lighthouse I heard of it but haven't
87:04 - used it yeah it's really cool I'll
87:06 - definitely I'll try to do stream on that
87:09 - soon then this is I yeah it's it's
87:14 - awesome so I definitely want to kind of
87:16 - show it to you all
87:18 - Anna says hi it's my first time here and
87:21 - I don't understand why we left image in
87:24 - h1 and h2 is it because you're working
87:26 - on an old project and you are afraid
87:28 - that initial styling would crash well
87:31 - kind of right so it is an old project
87:32 - but what we did is we brought over all
87:35 - this markup from one database and
87:37 - transferred it to a new one so that same
87:41 - pattern of image tags being used inside
87:43 - heading tags is used in a lot of places
87:46 - most likely so trying to find all those
87:49 - places and change the markup in every
87:51 - place would be really difficult it would
87:54 - time-consuming so that's why we're just
87:57 - trying to work with it as is I do have a
87:59 - plan to go through and change those
88:00 - eventually but right now I just need to
88:03 - get it looking good on a screen so that
88:05 - we can launch it and then hopefully I
88:08 - can have some student workers interns
88:10 - contract workers go through all that
88:13 - data and clean it up so that we don't
88:15 - have weird stuff like that going on but
88:19 - that's definitely a legit question you
88:21 - normally would not want to leave the
88:24 - image in the h1 tag although like it
88:26 - renders not really the best markup right
88:32 - but anyway good good question and also
88:38 - let me know if it's an ax or onna or I
88:40 - don't want to mispronounce your name so
88:43 - let me know what you prefer Chris says
88:47 - how is CSS grid coming along for me
88:51 - personally I haven't really been able to
88:53 - do much with it I haven't had time to to
88:55 - work with it
89:06 - Aniki says you can outrun a lighthouse
89:08 - check on a page directly from the chrome
89:10 - dev tools it's inside the audits head
89:12 - yeah yeah it's it's awesome it's so easy
89:15 - to run it
89:23 - Oh Jeff says this is for Minecraft again
89:27 - but this stream has gotten hijacked by
89:29 - minecraft so Jeff says you can set up a
89:31 - server using docker and then let them
89:33 - connect to it locally that's your genius
89:38 - you are a minecraft genius that's an
89:41 - awesome idea I'm gonna have to check
89:43 - that out like I literally have like old
89:47 - pcs just sitting around not doing
89:49 - anything I could like have a server
89:51 - running locally with docker like all the
89:56 - time and that's that's cool I love that
90:00 - idea thank you
90:11 - that doesn't says it's good you monitor
90:14 - your kids on there I played on servers
90:17 - with some creepers so I play on a
90:20 - kid-friendly one okay cool that's good
90:23 - to know that I'm not just being paranoid
90:24 - I like I just assume anything that's
90:28 - multiplayer online it potentially
90:30 - there's a way for inappropriate stuff to
90:32 - be done or said or whatever on there so
90:37 - that's why I just never let let my kids
90:40 - try that so so I guess that is that is
90:45 - in fact the case unfortunately Michael
90:54 - Chris has set up a Raspberry Pi as as a
90:57 - sir that would be cool that'd be really
91:01 - cool
91:12 - Ezekiel says they have a question sure

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna get back to doing some stuff with react components specifically we're gonna style some things so I know for the last week or so we've been working with my sequel databases and cloud storage and setting all that up which was really really cool learned a lot about that but I haven't actually done any react in a while so I'm excited to get back to it and hey everybody see some some hellos in the in the chat and just as I guess an update from yesterday so decided not to go with the basically like setting up a cname or an a record to work with that Google Cloud Storage so right now what I've been doing is trying to set up the my sequel database to work with WordPress running on now so that's what I was just doing just made an export of the database from WordPress and I was about to import it into our cloud sequel database but I think I'm gonna put that on hold and we're gonna do some styles and then I'll come back to that later on after that I'll need to set up our WordPress URL to go to the right place instead of our digitalocean droplet and then we should be all good to go with with WordPress and that'll be our production ready WordPress deployment some weird stuff going on outside my office this is just checking it out all right let me get my other screen ready and then I'll switch over the view so that you can see it all as well we will mostly be in Visual Studio code we bring this up first place will be all right cool I think everything is set up and should be working fine there we are okay so this is the main website should be pretty familiar to everyone at at this point and I was just finishing up a Pomodoro session so that's how much time I have left almost got the full session in and we're gonna go today we're gonna look at a few different pages and see like what what styling needs done and we'll we'll just kind of go from there and see what you know what we can do so here's one thing that my guest yesterday noticed so we had a kind of a guest on the show towards the end of yesterday's show named Haley and she's gonna help out with the site I'm hoping to hire her on as a contract worker so I'm gonna try to get all the details figured out today so she can start but she noticed here that we have you know this this length it's just playing a plane length right it's got the underline it's got the blue everything it it doesn't really like match right I mean it has the right font at least but it's a little weird that is just there in this case the title actually makes sense right it's we can tell it's a CV right at curriculum vitae but some of the other file names don't make any sense so we definitely should style this a bit differently and let people know what it is so this is this is what we're gonna work on first and it is going to take a bit of CSS but we're also going to potentially need to do some stuff with JavaScript as well so that's first up let me set my timer there we are and let's get to it so this is let's make it bigger so don't need that I was sort of limit plan and we don't need this right now and we don't need this all right let me know if that flan is big enough for everyone if you're just joining us for the first time I just set a Pomodoro timer and so we're gonna code for about 25 minutes when that timer goes off I'm going to go back to the live chat and I'm going to answer your questions so if you do have any questions please put them in the chat now and I will get to them in about 25 minutes alright so very simple with this component I'm gonna just describe this hopefully said even if you don't know react you'll know what's going on we all our data is stored in WordPress we're using the WordPress AP app while we're using graph QL to pull in the data and we're bringing that data in and we're basically just displaying all of it in a div on the page up here we're changing the data a little bit there's some things in there that just don't work for us right now so we're changing that data so here we're we're changing the data I think we need to I think we need to change a little bit about that curriculum vitae let's see harsh it says it's not readable and mobile art I'll make it bigger hopefully that's better and I think if I go any bigger it's going to be a little hard to to see it enough to actually do anything let me show you what the markup looks like and that way we can come up with a plan on how to edit that so I'm just going to inspect this in chrome dev tools and it's really small so I'm gonna make this bigger okay so we see here the link is contained inside this CV link element and then we just have an a tag and we have our file and the title there so this is going to be add straightforward to some of the other adjustments that we made that are already present in the component but this is what we need to target right the a tag within the CV link so let's let's try to do that so we were using regular expressions here to find what we wanted and then we're just replacing that I'm not sure that that's gonna work for us now at least not in the same way so the problem is like I can definitely target this and this will be the same across all of these pieces of data for these faculty profiles but I target this and then I still need to I need to at least get this this href right so I guess a truth all right my people out there who know a little bit more about regular expressions let me know what you think of this I'm gonna tell you what I want to do but I'm not exactly sure how to do it so let's let's work that out so here's what I'd like to do I'd like to potentially find this section basically CV link a href equals and then this first quotation mark and then grab everything up until that second quotation mark I want to grab that and then insert it into a template literal and then put that inside the CV link so I think that'll be the best way then what I'll do is just change the title of this to curriculum vitae something like that and so everybody will have a link that just says curriculum vitae so it'll all be standard will style the link to so they know like there won't be a million different you know names for each professors curriculum vitae so no matter what the file name is that they upload it'll say the same thing but I do still need to know what this with this href is pointing to so let's see I'm gonna see what you all are saying about this right now michael says can't you do CB link first child John says find CV link and change it to html5 details element will probably be the only of this type and style the tag a tag under details I'm not necessarily worried about the styling because that's going to be I can just style the the CV link directly would I basically I need somehow to grab this value inside the href if I can get this whoops if I can get this value then I'm fine but I just need a way to get this value only this value in it the only information that I'll have across all the pieces of content that we'll have for faculty profiles is this CV link so I need to grab the HR value inside the a inside the CV link if this was back in my jQuery days this would be easy but it's not and essentially remember we're not dealing with like the Dom here at this point this is just a string coming through so we're still dealing with this content as a string right it gets set as you know HTML here but we can't use like normal at least if we're going to make the change before it actually hits the page we can't actually I just had an idea okay so we can't I really hate to do this because it's react but alright here's an alternate plan what if we just let the data go to into the Dom as is then afterwards so like I don't know after the components mounts or whatever then we do some stuff to manipulate it while it's in the Dom would that be easier could we just go in at that point find the a SAG within the CV link element and then just change the text and would that mess up reiax ability to track what's going on would that also mess up our serverside rendering would the serverside rendering be off from what's on the clientside okay so our should say and that would work Nikki's saying you just want to do it in component did him out okay all right well let's we can try it I think for me at least because I'm not an expert at all in regular expressions I think it might be easier to try the second way but I'm still open to the first way all right so let's let's see let's assume I guess we can we can do some work here in the console actually so let's go in here the console is clear all this out it's a document elements a tag name and then let's say see the is a CV link is that what it was let's see if we can grab it yep so we have CV link we can get that if you have our CV link and we have our inner HTML in our inner text yes all right how about this the shudders you know text equals no it didn't it didn't actually change it shoot I need to get more space here let's let's open this up all right so I can change it here but it doesn't actually update in the dawn see okay harsh it says it won't mess up as that part is not frequently rerendered okay all right cool awesome Michael I think your ear I think you get the right idea that CV link let's try this oops what was I thinking why don't I do this yeah yes okay that's what we need all right cool but it's not it actually changed everything in there okay so this is not exactly what we want let's see let's look at this structure a little bit more text content I think that's what might work better out of HTML out of it and it says hmm it looks like there's a lot that we we kid tried it's argued here let's try something else then let's refresh the page and try something else so it looks like we can we could try text content or we could try outer text I'd rather not have to mess with the a tag at all right so let's refresh so want to get the original the original stuff back here we'll inspect this again and then all right so let's check it out instead of inner text what was I I say we were gonna do it was a text content okay let's see if this works it equals it still takes a lot okay we'll have to get hard saying use query selector Michael's saying could we try CV links here yeah let's let's try that so let's say see what we get if we put a zero in here undefined okay you know all right so Harshit that's a great idea so hard saying we could do document dot query selector and then do CV link a shoot it's not working oh no wonder it's not working I just took it out of the page all right now let's try one more time CV link a yes okay so we have CV like a and let's try to go what was it inner text let's try to change that inner text yes and does this work it does we're getting the right nice alright so that's what we need to use so let's copy that and let's go over here and let's add a component it mounts and let's try to do is like a query selector equals you see me we'll save you CV see if that works we'll save it so this is let this be a lesson to everyone my my mistake so when you don't take the time to learn how to select things in Dom with vanilla JavaScript plain JavaScript and you just rely on jQuery all the time you don't remember all of these selectors so you all were giving me the names right luckily I also had dev tools that was Auto completing stuff for me so I could see what it was but if we were working with jQuery I would know automatically how to do that and I would have done it in you know a minute it would've been easy right so that's awesome if I always get to work with jQuery but I don't in fact I rarely use jQuery at all anymore and I know how to do a lot with react but when it comes to stuff like this I don't have that background knowledge of of it I assume it's possible but I always have to look it up so it slows me down so I appreciate all the help there but starting out sometimes you for me at least I I know like I would look at stuff like this and say it's so much easier to do a jQuery I'm just gonna use jQuery right and I never took the time to learn that so there's value in taking the time to learn that like this is always going to work but the jQuery will only work if you're using jQuery right and you there's not really a guarantee that you're always going to have that of so just just a note if you're thinking like I did that this is just way too much typing to do something that you don't have to type as much to jQuery there's definitely a time for this alright so I know enough about that let's see if it actually works refresh okay re it does work there's a little flash which is not is not unexpected there's a small flash of the original content so I'll say this at this point essentially we've done what we wanted to do with that I don't like that there's a little flash it's not the end of the world but that's where I think that the regular expression solution that I talked about first would probably be the better solution because we would never get that flash of content so I guess what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do this right now and that way for those of you who aren't quite familiar with git and get up this might be helpful to you we will go to see that yeah we're gonna go here and I'm gonna open up an issue right and that way this will be good for two reasons one I won't forget about it but then also this is going to be there for anyone that would like to tackle this issue and will say this jeez all right so we're just gonna leave a little a little issue right so if anybody wants to try to tackle it and they're good with regular expressions they can try to you know fix that I shouldn't say fix it but fix it in what I think will be a better way right they'll solve that problem in a better way so all right so right now and the faculty j/s components this is probably hard to see as a man so right now in the faculty jazz component this text is changed components it mouths there we go so that's just a really basic amount of info it does say what what component to look in so I think this would be OK for now potentially I could add some screenshots and things like that I'm not since I'm streaming right now but I mean the more information you can add to an issue the more it would help someone who wants to actually solve that issue and we can give it a label as well and we can say help wants it and now everyone will know hey like this is up for grabs let's submit this issue okay and you know maybe someone's interested maybe someone's not let me check my time and before we go on all right about two minutes this is enough time to do some basic CSS stuff just to see like what we'd want to do so when we're doing CSS I think it's always a great idea to do your initial stuff in the end F tools so let me get rid of my console area here and I'm gonna push this out so we have as much space as we can because really what I want to get to is is this portion here so on this a tag that's what we're gonna focus our Styles so what we want to do is get rid of that line so we're gonna do textdecorationnone okay right and that just got rid of that line for us and I definitely want the color to be something different so we're gonna change that color and I I want it to be the same color that we've been using for links elsewhere and let me let me find where we have that color and do we not have it anywhere in this place I thought we'd have it somewhere all right let me open up a new a new little window here so I can find where that color is since I can't remember what the the hex code is pretty sure that we have it here oh there it was I skipped over it so this is the color we've been using for links let's inspect grab the hex code there we go I knew we were using something that would be difficult to remember so we did change it up a little bit use the hsla instead of just a normal hex color color there we go so that's much cleaner I think to just have it there because it's a different color you know it may invite users to click if we wanted it to stand out more if we thought maybe that was really like important we could make maybe the font weight a bit bigger we could even think about making it a button but I mean the words view CV seemed to invite a click right so in general I is for something like this this is not really an action that I want users to take I'd rather make it subtle but clear if I really really wanted users to click on that CV I would probably make it a button and I would make it stand out so that as soon as you see that page like you that button is right there so I think this will be okay my timer did just go up so I'm going to take a short break we do a five minute break and then we'll come back and we'll transfer those Styles over into probably a CSS file for this particular component and I'll explain why we're going to do it like that when we when we come back for our second Pomodoro session so right now I'm going to scroll up to the top of the chat try to answer as many questions as I can in this fiveminute period I'm also going to very quickly look at my messages and make sure that there's nothing workrelated all right it doesn't look like it I did I just got a charge from Google services for four dollars and 23 cents I wonder if that was from yesterday when when I did all that stuff I don't know for sure if it's from from yesterday but it's possibly a light in space says greetings from Germany hey how's it going Oh a zekiel says free code camp has been updated and its new oh I didn't let's check that out free code camp dot org I have not seen the new stuff signin wait really didn't you used to be able to do this with github if you create signin you're gonna click here to add an email address to your account sign ok yep yep yep submit yay go to the coding curriculum yeah let's learn about that Wow alright sorry I'm hijacking this this fiveminute session here but I think this is amazing okay so new stuff on free code camp a thousand coding challenges more than a thousand new coding challenges amazing that's really I I might have started doing coding challenges again I mean just for fun just to check it out so uh the information security stuff testing really cool new certifications so these are in addition to the old ones we have there six new certifications Wow okay so you can skip the coding challenges and just do the project if you're able to complete the project that you can get the certification that's cool alright cool they're test Suites for the projects very cool coding interview prep challenges that that could be very useful very cool enhanced privacy I'm not that worried about the privacy just assume I have no privacy on the internet but if you're worried about that that's cool fully customizable portfolio pages that's cool oh that's really cool so the free code camp portfolio pages were kind of you really couldn't do much with them before note the platform another for Athena learned free code camp org very cool all right let's check that up as you type search very cool if you've watched what we've done with search before you know I'm a fan of the as you type search password the signin you y'all know I'm also a big fan of the password the signin as well that's cool new welcome dashboard awesome really cool yeah for sure let's give that a what this is a separate account from the throw things it over your town I know I know I'm pretty sure I already have this account too right I do yes awesome all right cool alright so here's the new some of the curriculum the new stuff I'm not gonna go through all of it but just to see like what we have here cool got some react stuff Redux dative is AP is security and the coding prep stuff really cool new stuff like CSS grid that's cool that this is really cool what is this introduction go to the first lesson really cool that's awesome Wow there are a lot of coding project all right challenges you can see I haven't got any of my certificates yet zero out of six but anyway that's that's cool hopefully that that was helpful for you all I was just really excited so you know what let me let me needs to reset that and answer some questions since I said I was going to do five minutes of questions who aim high seer yeah I I haven't seen you here in a long time I was it going how's the the job going you don't have to tell me on the chat if you don't want to but send me a DM or something and let me know I'm interested to see how it's to know what's you know what's going on with that Dutchess is here good morning thanks for watching harsh it only has two days left for the summer holidays so will you have you have a lot less time then after the holidays harsh it and Ezekiel says this is the best day ever in my life is that because the new freakout cam stuff came out lucifer says hi hey how's it going Luke kesh says can anyone explain how to set up a basic react app with an express server project without something like create react app or gas fee I want to do that on cloud base I des like glitch is intended the truth dive I don't know that I've ever setup react without using something like next or create react app I think I use Gatsby once so yeah I don't I'm not the person to talk to about that just because I always I never really had a use case where it would be valuable for me to do it like that but I'm I'm sure you know probably some of the other people with a chat have done it like that I like to asked if the this method that we ended up going with is more reliable than the regular expression I don't know about reliable to be honest with you I would think the method that we used is probably less reliable I mean they're they're both it's probably gonna work but the fact that there's a delay between like the Dom loads the user actually sees this I don't know that makes me a little bit nervous so I think for this use case either one would work but I would definitely feel more comfortable with a regular expression way of doing it but sometimes it's just like you make it work and then if you have time like you can go back and do it but on a project this big it just doesn't make sense for me to spend a ton of time on small details like this at least not before launch like after launch I couldn't go like work out all these details but if I try to do all the details now like the site won't launch for you know months and months Michael says I didn't realize you could use multiple tags in query selector I usually cascade them I didn't realize you could either but that's really really helpful I'm going to take a drink before we start our next session okay I didn't get through everything in the chat so I will have to pick up where I left off and when we come back but now let's do some CSS and where's my timer there we go let's set this we'll probably just do one more Pomodoro session and then I got to get back to spending the rest I have so much to do today actually if you excuse me for a second let me just vent for a second on air so I'm giving a talk this weekend at Pittsburg tech fest on basically setting up what we've been doing here for the last few months react with WordPress as the content management system using graph QL I wanted to do videos so that I could set tell people at my talk like if you want to know more in depth check out the videos because I think I only have a half an hour so obviously I'm not gonna go stepbystep through this whole thing I didn't haven't made the videos yet like well obviously we've done it on the live stream but I'm not gonna tell people like hey go watch on a 100 plus hours of the live stream just for this project so I need to work on that I have a little bit of work to do for client like realistically it'll probably take me 15 minutes to do the client work but it's still like it's something else on my mind that has to be done by tomorrow at in tomorrow morning and then I sell both this work right for this site so there's still data that needs to be brought over both to the database and to the google cloud storage bucket so a lot I haven't done any work out today which may not seem like a big deal to you but for like mental health purposes if I don't get workouts in for a few days in a row like I will definitely feel depressed so while I'm still feeling upbeat I need to get that workout in if I wait til tomorrow I'm afraid like I will just not be up for it and it'll probably be a downward spiral for a few days so alright then over just wanted to share that with you all let's get back to this all right so I like this let's take this now which why did I do that let's grab this and I'm going to copy this not really that much to type out but I'm not gonna remember that to type it out and let's go over here and see first of all do we have styles yes we do we have a faculty CSS file that we can use and that's awesome so let's put it in there and as we're putting that in there I'm gonna explain why we're using this instead of styles inside of our component which we've done on some other components so in within our project we have a static folder and styles and then there that's where all our CSS files are okay so let's go down yeah I'm just gonna put this down here and we'll go see the link a and then we'll paste those in save it and let's refresh and make sure that it'll work yep there we go our styles are there and we can verify here yep the styles are there it's coming from our faculty CSS file great here's what we did it like that the the content that we're bringing in that we want to style right we're bringing it in from WordPress as a string and then we're adding it to the Dom here right so there's no there are no elements present within this component as it is now where I could just put a style on there like in line or where I could add a class to to let's say if I did all the Styles up here is like a JavaScript object you know I couldn't add that as we've done in other components right because those essentially like those elements that are ending up on the page don't even exist at that point so what we end up having to do then is kind of do it the oldfashioned way where we put in this this head tag here with a link to our CSS file as we move forward and clean up this data and pull it in as I really want to do it you know the best way that I know how we can phase this out and we can start putting all our Styles inside our component either as inline Styles or as JavaScript object all right then everything can be truly like modular right and reusable we can get rid of the CSS files for now of posts now that we have in WordPress of custom posts which I've shown you all before it's just it's too much so that's why we're doing it this way if if I could I would do it differently but there's not really anything wrong with doing it like this it does just get to be a bit of a mess we have so many different CSS files for a different component some components we have styles going on in three different ways we have inline styles in the component we have styles in a JavaScript object in a component and then we have styles in a CSS file that gets pulled into the unit so we don't have a lot of consistency in our CSS right now but that's that's a known issue it's it's what we have to work out now it's kind of like an inbetween step to get this thing running but eventually we will this will be in better shape you know once we have more time but right now a lot of people are expecting this site to launch so in terms of what the user will see they'll never know the difference when we switch all this over it'll be the same for them so it's only going to be from the standpoint of developers and how easy it is to figure out what's going on and and you know contribute edit the files that'll be a lot nicer once everything is you know organized properly and in terms of you know all the data like how we're pulling it in okay so let's move on you check the time yeah let's move on we'll do a quick scan at this page and just say look over here I think it looks I mean the rest of this page looks alright there's nothing that stands out in ink when it comes to styles there's always more you could probably do but right now I'm not looking for that I'm looking for is there something that looks really weird on this page that looks maybe broken or something like that so from that point of view I don't see anything right so let's go let's see let's just check page we'll just go down through and check some pages just really quickly I mean look broken actually I did see something so let's go to device and let's try this pixel to see what it looks like this is not good all right so we have this split here so I noticed this yesterday when I was looking at this on a phone so let's try that out we try to fix that and see wow that's just hanging out there right so it's we have an h2 tag then an image and then right below that we just we just have the text so the image is actually within the h2 that's a little odd you usually don't see that but that's what we have to work with right now so ideally what we want to do is if we can keep the markup exactly the same and just use CSS that's ideal that takes the least amount of time for us if we have to adjust the markup we want to do that within the component using regular expressions or like we just did you know with a bit of JavaScript because that saves us from having to manually edit it if both of those things are impossible which we haven't really come across that yet but if they were impossible that would mean we'd have to go back manually edit all that stuff in a bunch of places you don't want to have to do that so let's try the first thing CSS let's see what we can do so we're gonna have to put the styles on the h2 tag itself and I'm gonna make this bigger since you know we're dealing with this small viewport so we can make this a lot bigger we already have our h2 here so already putting some Styles on here in the department dot CSS file so let's see just wrap I'm not really sure what's it what to do here word wrap all right so we have break word that looks terrible as well so I'm not I'm not gonna go with that maybe let's put something on this image how about that let's see wow it has inline Styles on it already so that's getting pulled in floatright let me know what your thoughts are on on this image but here's what I'm thinking what if we go with left and let's do let's take out this height 100% take out the height now is this gonna I want to see how this looks up here actually I know this that's way too big great we don't want don't want it that big all right how about let's refresh the page reset it and let's go with we on the image you may just need to go with a media clear here Oh John Hanson is saying whitespacenowrap John is he's also saying how does that even happen image nested in an h2 should not even render yeah but this is the markup that we've inherited so we got to work with it at least for a little while alright so let's try I'll get rid of that let's see what John said whitespacenowrap and let's go back to this maybe I need to put that on the h2 oh not Lucas just try a fixed height with auto width okay you try that Nicki says doesn't make it so that CSS isn't global and only for that page yeah yeah so each page has its own CSS file all right so that's not it's not gonna work at least not like as is but let's go down to this image and see if we can mmmhmm let me see some of the other things I mean it's resized and soon all right let's let's reset again and alright let's assume to make this simpler let's assume that we're going to use a media query so we only have to deal with the mobile size so let's figure out where that query needs to be so we'll figure out exactly where this starts looking really weird right here so let's make that media query at about 500 pixels just to make it a nice even number so that we can remember so at about 500 pixels then we're going to do this we're gonna get rid of the float and let's go with cities are our let's go with eight pixels Auto actually I don't really like that being centered let's let's get rid of the margin and margin Auto and let's just go with the margin of eight pixels all around so I like now you know what I don't even like that let's go with the margin of eight and zero all right that looks a lot better like and by better I don't mean ideal right not perfect but it doesn't look like it's broken now alright so basically here's what we've done and this is only gonna apply when it's under 500 pixels right because let's just see like this is what it would look like when it's over not terrible but it definitely doesn't look as good we have all this white space right that's not that's not better than what we had before where you had a nice wrapping effect so for under 500 pixels we're going to get rid of the float we're gonna add a margin of 8 pixels top and bottom right because we need a little bit of that space here up at the top it's fine we already have some space but I'm putting the 8 there just in case you know if if let's say I come back in and do different things with this facing I don't have to worry about it being too close so but we do want at least 8 pixels of space between here you know potentially even more you know that still might be a little close but we got our mounting this is on a smaller screen so we don't want to have a ton of space that's going to increase the amount of scroll and then we set it to display block right that's what finally kind of pushed this down from where it was so let's put this now in our department dot CSS file and we're going to have to use important because this is on the element hopefully this alert that's on the element alright let's see if it works yeah so we need to be able to override these inline Styles right that are right there coming through like from the data that we're pulling in alright so let's find our toys are static static static Department don't see it so we are using Department dot CSS I guess we'll just continue to use that technically this isn't a department page but let's let's do it and let's go with inch this is h2 yeah I guess I'm okay with this it's we'll put this on the h2 image yeah so this will only work on images that are in an h2 tag which is fine I'm hoping that that's a rare occurrence so let's go h2 image forgot I'm not using sass all right we got to do the media query first at media and media screen and max with this is 500 reset 500 pixels what did i do what did I mess up nothing right this works and whoops and then we need to say h2 image we'll add that in there and we also need to do floats what we want to do float none yeah none let's just verify that that works yep so we're gonna do floats none and we're gonna put important on there we don't normally want to use important right so in this case though we have to because the the markup is really forcing us to because I'm not going to be able to override inline styles without using that I'm just going to go ahead and throw it on each one of these it might not be necessary on everyone but since we're already using it there's not really that much value in messing around and and potentially not having ourselves work so let's see if this works refresh okay awesome so that works we can see these styles are being overridden but the real test is was this work yep that works awesome so you can see we don't have all that whitespace once again probably not how I would make this page if I was doing it from scratch but now it won't look broken and not only that hopefully every other page that's using that CSS file that has an image inside an h2 tag will now be fixed all right cool let me check my time three more minutes let's see if we can find something to squeeze in here in there's three minutes also I'd like to see like are we having similar issues Wow so this is going float respect that's not a great image like I I normally like the image of the San Damiano crucifix like we used it in the catechol Institute website that was project one and it looked amazing but with this background color it doesn't stand out so I'm definitely gonna at some point probably try to replace that image but for now that's the image that we have so this is an image within an h1 tag Wow okay and it is using Department CSS so let's let's do the same thing that we just did but let's also add in h1 tags so within here let's just go with each one image and h2 image are gonna have the same same styling we'll see that will do a refresh and we'll see okay that's on this side and then but when it gets bigger we still have the effect that we want all right great I think that looks better you know not perfect but much better than having it flow to the right all right awesome we've got about a minute left not really confident I can get anything else done in a minute but let's see new info coming soon employment HR wonderful all right that page actually looks like there's no change needed faculty opening nope and that page doesn't work I have a list of all the pages that don't work so I am aware of them all academics undergraduate this page yeah this face is actually okay we can go did we already check these out we did some styling work on these pages this is kind of weird so we have different font with our font font weights I mean they're different font weights going on a lot of different font weights and sizes happening here so it could probably use some cleanup at the very least if like this text we're just all the same I think that would be better but that'll be I have to save that for a different time this will end up being an easy fix though but my timer is running out I am curious to see why it's doing this mmm okay so these have some inline styles that are overriding what we have here so really if we just went with you know something like using important for the styles that are likely already there those P tags then I think that that would work so for instance we could just important here and this should override it right so now we have the proper line height and then I'm not sure where yeah so the font should be Roboto font family but that's all the way on main so we're bought a saying say San serif should be important to interesting but that's not hmm yeah so we may have to go ahead on the P tags and put in font family Roboto important right that would fix it see so not not really a difficult fix here so and this is a major CSS but like really this is something that could probably be used like across the board this is standard for P tags so they may want to make some sort of global style so we don't repeat it all over the place I kind of think that font is a little small I mean it's 18 pixels but maybe it's just my screen okay now I'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer as much as I can also let's let's go ahead and push these changes to github get status so we can see we've changed faculty a Dodge is our department dot CSS and faculty dot CSS so let's do a git add and yarn CM let's do a feature and let's just say styles for CV link and images and header tags heading okay that works no breaking changes it does not affect open issues it's going to run all the linting all the Auto formatting all the tests and then it will commit after that assuming everything passes all right so while that's doing its thing I will answer some questions and then I'll make sure that I push this up to github so that you all can check this out if you want oh that was fast awesome so now I just do get push and everything is now available on github well now it is I'm just trying to find where I left off okay let's see now I should ask can anyone help make an awesome card component for the UI library that I am working on alright so let her should know how I should I would love to help you make a card component but I don't think I'll have time for sure not this week or weekend so I guess it depends on how soon you want it done but if I can I'll try to help John says have you not been using therefore your CSS colors no I haven't I haven't I really I should I should use CSS variables Nietzsche says did the new curriculum finally launch nice yeah it looks like it John says it can be helpful if the link text that isn't an obvious link to load with a subtle but obvious animation like color scale translator transform when the element comes as well yet now I don't have it up there yeah you're right you know maybe it might not be a bad idea for all links to I don't know if this is exactly what you're talking about but now that you said that it kind of makes me think you know potentially maybe there should be some sort of animation on hover for a link other than just the cursor you know the typical course or pointer I would want it to be subtle something just like a very slight shift in in color maybe just in the maybe a little lighter or a little darker nothing nothing too crazy that Duchess is this is really in comment to someone else in the chat Matt duchesses only game minecraft once in a while I just stood out to me cuz I really like Minecraft I got my my oldest son into it actually all my kids except for the baby or into Minecraft its they love it even like my threeyearold wants to play Minecraft he gets him so stuck in in like holes and needs help to get out but he likes to run around and and like dig get skeletons and stuff but anyway I don't know anybody else a Minecraft fan out there like you can you spend a lot of time in Minecraft and just get lost in that that world but uh I think it's a fun game Aniki says new livestream idea Jesse gets free code camp certifications actually that would be fun that would be really so if it ever happens that I can't livestream my actual work projects like I don't know if it happens he it probably won't happen here but like let's say I have to get it done another job for whatever reason and I can't then maybe that would be a great idea for a stream to do like all the free code camp projects live that would be fun although like I already have so many side project ideas to do as well so I could definitely work on those too Nicola ass is this website only frontend no so we're doing everything for it for this particular stream today we were just working with frontend stuff but in previous streams and in future streams you know we were working with backend which is node but we also have WordPress setup and we build PHP plugin for that and got cloud sequel database cloud storage like we're working on a lot of a lot of stuff so kind of a larger project and so I think there's there's something for everyone in this process a Nietzsche says is there a reason that you import that stylesheet and the head tag instead of just importing the CSS file is that an XJS thing or is it serverside rendering thing to be honest with you I don't remember why we did it that way I just vaguely remember that we had to do it that way and that I did try to do it a different way but I really can't recall I mean it's probably on a stream but I don't remember when that that happened so yeah I really don't remember what it could be that I could do it another way and then I just didn't figure that way out and this one worked so I went with it but I can't remember this scrub scrub I don't know how to pronounce skru BYZ says no love for flexbox and that was probably when we were doing the image thing so I like flexbox but we just were having to deal with floats already set like we brought this content over from an older system and that's how how they were doing it so we're just kind of dealing with what we have let's see Aniki says the what frequency in a code review of that stuff you have to work with would be off the charts yeah I'm like I'm so used to it it doesn't really surprise me that much so when I see this but it's it is pretty wild though I mean it keeps it fun like surprising like it's really it's cool like like wow I've never seen that before I mean that's that's kind of fun that I've been doing this for years and years and it's like I still see stuff in websites that I've never seen that in terms of the markup like haven't seen that before that's cool it's just amazing what will actually work in a browser you know like you can you can do crazy stuff with a markup and it still actually renders michael creo says do you run lighthouse audits on your sites i was thinking about accessibility yeah I recently ran an audit on on this site that we're working on and I actually got a decent accessibility score so that's going to be something that we will be working on it may be I'm not exactly sure if it'll be pre or post launch when we do a lot with that because realistically like even this site as is is a huge improvement over the the current web site so I think it's even if we don't have perfect accessibility score it's still gonna be more accessible I want to double check that to verify but I'm pretty sure it is still be more accessible so I think as an incremental step launching this would be good and then we can try to work towards being like fully accessible so but it is coming it's something that is definitely on my mind and I think it's important so that I not I hope hopefully would love to do work on that during a stream go through the whole process of using lighthouse I don't know if everybody knows what it is or how to use it but it might be cool to do a whole stream just on going lighthouse and trying to fix all the stuff that can get our scores up thanks for bringing that up Jeff says I have a minecraft server running at home cool med that just says cool I fall off in love a lot then log like I hate that I mean you get your character they all build up and you have the sweet armor and stuff and like no enemies can take you out and then you just mess up and fall in love at once and you're done anyway oh cool you know what I've never tried to do anything with servers like playing online with servers on minecraft I always because my kids are playing it I was like I'm just gonna let you play this offline and it'll be safe but maybe like if I'm supervising I could get try that out because that's a whole like part of the game that seems really cool that I've never experienced without my minecraft by the way Zuber says hi i disconnected from your Shing for a while is this still university project any plans for starting a new project from beginning then oh yeah we definitely will this is so the university project we for sure have have new projects coming up so it will start one from beginning to end here I can't tell you for sure when that will happen but it will definitely happen I'm sure my bosses have lots of stuff lined up for me after I launched this site mate it may seek says can you show what you did already create the website yeah you know what let me let me show you this site but then also so this I'll just show you the home page there's likes way too much to show the whole site but I can give you the link as well so I'm gonna type that into the live chat here now okay so I just put the link in the live chat if anybody would like to go to the site check it out you'll feel free let me know if you've got any ideas for making it better or if you if you see something that's like for sure broken please let me know anyway but you know just kind of really briefly here's the home page you know one thing I was thinking about for accessibility is I don't really know if this text is readable enough like for a person with like good vision it's okay but if somebody doesn't have great vision I'm not really sure like I I'm thinking about maybe doing something I mean I like this image and yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do about that but that's something I'm not I've been thinking about lately you know about maybe doing something with it John Hanson says mistakes in HDL markup get rendered in the Dom only because the dome sees the mistakes and bandages them on the fly not like PHP that's cool I mean it's I know it's good and bad right it could it can encourage people to write their markup in ways that aren't the best you can write markup in ways that are let's say entirely unaccessible to screen readers and things like that and it'll still work and so unless people get away with that but at the same time it makes it really easy to build websites even if they're not great websites you can so I don't know I guess their pros and cons to that duchesses yeah I wanted to see accessibility and lighthouse I heard of it but haven't used it yeah it's really cool I'll definitely I'll try to do stream on that soon then this is I yeah it's it's awesome so I definitely want to kind of show it to you all Anna says hi it's my first time here and I don't understand why we left image in h1 and h2 is it because you're working on an old project and you are afraid that initial styling would crash well kind of right so it is an old project but what we did is we brought over all this markup from one database and transferred it to a new one so that same pattern of image tags being used inside heading tags is used in a lot of places most likely so trying to find all those places and change the markup in every place would be really difficult it would timeconsuming so that's why we're just trying to work with it as is I do have a plan to go through and change those eventually but right now I just need to get it looking good on a screen so that we can launch it and then hopefully I can have some student workers interns contract workers go through all that data and clean it up so that we don't have weird stuff like that going on but that's definitely a legit question you normally would not want to leave the image in the h1 tag although like it renders not really the best markup right but anyway good good question and also let me know if it's an ax or onna or I don't want to mispronounce your name so let me know what you prefer Chris says how is CSS grid coming along for me personally I haven't really been able to do much with it I haven't had time to to work with it Aniki says you can outrun a lighthouse check on a page directly from the chrome dev tools it's inside the audits head yeah yeah it's it's awesome it's so easy to run it Oh Jeff says this is for Minecraft again but this stream has gotten hijacked by minecraft so Jeff says you can set up a server using docker and then let them connect to it locally that's your genius you are a minecraft genius that's an awesome idea I'm gonna have to check that out like I literally have like old pcs just sitting around not doing anything I could like have a server running locally with docker like all the time and that's that's cool I love that idea thank you that doesn't says it's good you monitor your kids on there I played on servers with some creepers so I play on a kidfriendly one okay cool that's good to know that I'm not just being paranoid I like I just assume anything that's multiplayer online it potentially there's a way for inappropriate stuff to be done or said or whatever on there so that's why I just never let let my kids try that so so I guess that is that is in fact the case unfortunately Michael Chris has set up a Raspberry Pi as as a sir that would be cool that'd be really cool Ezekiel says they have a question sure what's your question I'm not sure so Ezekiel you never put your questions so let me know what it is if I in the stream before you can give me the question Senate DME on Twitter or on some social media site and I'll answer it and that just said site is looking good thank you thank you I appreciate it Chris says I have 2050 and 2070 vision and the text looks fine to me however I am on a 32 inch TV ok cool out you know maybe I'll just we'll see maybe I'm worrying about it like prematurely you know I haven't gotten any like complaints about it so yeah maybe it's not it's not about Jeff says I can see if I can find a docker file for you yeah that would be awesome yeah if you could that would I would really appreciate that primal fear says keep up the good work thank you I appreciate that Phoenix says I love the grid and I have a slight crush on flesh that's awesome I love that the way you expressed that oh cool this is John and Nikki both are saying that great and flexbox can be used together that's really cool all right I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat and wow the stream is pretty decently long we're over an hour and a half now so I'm really really hungry I'd love to get some lunch right now and I don't know this was a fun stream let me know if you like these streams where we kind of do some more like basic CSS stuff it's definitely fun for me because usually everything I try works eventually and so anyway I had a good time with some art tomorrow's Friday I'll do my best to stream tomorrow although like as I said I have a lot to do before my talk on Saturday if anybody is in Pittsburgh and I don't know if they're still selling tickets to Pittsburgh tech fest but if they are check it out come see me and if you're gonna be there like find me and introduce yourself I'd love to meet meet you all in person so maybe I stream tomorrow maybe not if I don't sing tomorrow then and probably won't see you until Monday but until next time have a wonderful day and work weekend
