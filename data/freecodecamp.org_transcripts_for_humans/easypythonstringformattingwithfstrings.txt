00:00 - the best way to format strings in Python
00:02 - is by using F strings traditionally we
00:04 - use something called concatenation to
00:07 - join strings and variables together this
00:09 - is a way of joining strings and
00:11 - variables using the addition operator so
00:14 - as you can see right here this joins a
00:16 - string and a variable but it is quite
00:18 - messy so the best way to do this is by
00:20 - using F strings in F strings all you
00:22 - need to do is to add an F right before
00:25 - you start the string and whenever you
00:27 - want to include a variable you just need
00:29 - to cover it with curly braces as you can
00:32 - see this is way better and cleaner and
00:34 - it's also more readable if I run this
00:37 - you can see that both of them gives us
00:39 - the same response but this is a better
00:41 - way of doing it
