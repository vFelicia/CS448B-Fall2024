00:00 - hey everybody
00:01 - welcome to the free code camp
00:04 - 2018 top contributors party in dublin
00:09 - yeah
00:10 - here before we get started i have some
00:13 - very quick announcements
00:14 - uh things that are coming up very soon
00:16 - that i think everybody who's interested
00:18 - in free code camp should know first of
00:20 - all
00:22 - just like last year when free co camp
00:25 - participated in hacktoberfest
00:27 - and hacktoberfest is the month of
00:29 - october it's a big push to get people to
00:32 - contribute to open source
00:34 - last year free code camps guide
00:37 - was the
00:38 - number one most contributed to open
00:41 - source repo
00:43 - as part of hacktoberfest
00:47 - we're taking a lot of the existing
00:49 - repositories we've got learn we've got
00:51 - curriculum we've got the free codecamp
00:53 - slash recording at the main repository
00:56 - uh
00:57 - and then we've got the guide we're
00:58 - working
00:59 - to
01:00 - unify
01:01 - these
01:02 - repos into a single repository that will
01:05 - make it easier
01:07 - for everybody to get the local free code
01:09 - camp running
01:11 - a couple other announcements since you
01:13 - are watching this on the youtube channel
01:16 - according to like the youtube analytics
01:18 - we looked at free code camp is now the
01:21 - fastest growing programming
01:23 - youtube
01:24 - channel uh
01:28 - yeah and
01:29 - we are getting about 50 000 new
01:32 - subscribers a month if you create
01:35 - compelling videos about programming and
01:37 - you're interested we would love to help
01:40 - more people see your instagram content
01:43 - your videos so
01:45 - just reach out to us and we can make
01:48 - that happen but for us
01:50 - we want to put as many amazing
01:52 - videos on youtube as we can
01:54 - we're here in dublin we're at i've got a
01:57 - cool sign for it the huckle tree
02:00 - which is a really cool hipster name
02:04 - i'm gonna try to talk to as many of you
02:06 - all as possible and just interview you
02:08 - and learn more about you so
02:11 - hey
02:12 - i'm here with brianna swift
02:14 - you have been involved with freco camp
02:17 - since basically the beginning maybe you
02:18 - can just give us a high level overview
02:21 - of your involvement with free code camp
02:23 - and and your transition into being a
02:25 - developer
02:26 - yeah so i found free code camp uh while
02:29 - i was an elementary school music teacher
02:31 - i was trying to learn how to code
02:34 - i love kids i love teaching music but i
02:36 - knew it wasn't a career that i wanted to
02:38 - do forever so i was like what can i
02:40 - learn how to do
02:42 - without having to quit my job and go
02:43 - back to school because i couldn't afford
02:45 - to do that and i thought the people that
02:47 - make the internet are probably the first
02:49 - ones to put all of that information for
02:51 - free on the internet
02:53 - um so i did code academy mostly
02:55 - javascript type stuff and found my way
02:57 - onto free code camp
02:59 - i was really involved on twitter that
03:01 - was my only community because i was
03:02 - really kind of alone while i was
03:04 - learning
03:06 - and went through the free code camp
03:07 - challenges and
03:09 - as soon as i started doing that i
03:11 - started to get involved more in the chat
03:12 - room which there was no forum at that
03:14 - point and started doing some pair
03:15 - programming and streaming that
03:18 - so free code camp really not only taught
03:20 - me
03:21 - the fundamentals that i needed for
03:24 - you know for development and for
03:25 - software but also gave me a community
03:28 - and a place to
03:29 - you know commiserate almost with how
03:32 - hard it is to learn how to code and
03:35 - based on
03:36 - your videos on youtube and the skills
03:38 - that you were able to build up just
03:40 - learning the code on your own and
03:41 - through different communities
03:43 - you were able to eventually get a job
03:48 - can you talk a little bit about your job
03:49 - and how you got it
03:51 - yeah yes i work at github which is not
03:53 - where i thought i would be working when
03:55 - i started learning to code
03:56 - i'm a trainer so most of the time i'm
03:58 - talking to developers about how to use
04:00 - git and github so regardless of what
04:03 - language they're programming in
04:04 - regardless of what type of projects how
04:05 - big their team is everybody should
04:07 - probably be using version control and
04:10 - git is not the simplest thing to wrap
04:12 - your head around so it's a similar
04:13 - challenge to these computer science
04:15 - concepts like how can we make this
04:16 - simple and approachable
04:18 - um
04:19 - this you know that transition was weird
04:22 - because going from elementary school
04:23 - music teacher to working at github is
04:25 - kind of a jump
04:28 - but
04:29 - but i think working with those videos
04:31 - specifically and saying how can we take
04:32 - these difficult concepts and make them
04:34 - approachable to anybody is something
04:35 - that
04:37 - really primed me for working at github
04:39 - so i think even if somebody's going
04:40 - through free code camp and if you're
04:42 - going through free code camp and you're
04:43 - like i don't know if i necessarily see
04:44 - myself as a full-time developer
04:48 - that's okay like there are so many
04:50 - places for you that are perfect for you
04:53 - that you might just not know exist like
04:54 - i didn't know that this job existed but
04:56 - i love it
04:57 - awesome thanks again thank you quincy
05:00 - why don't you just tell us a little
05:02 - about yourself pete sure
05:04 - so my name is pete and i'm a data
05:05 - scientist based in london
05:09 - and i uh write for and help edit the
05:12 - medium publication i've been doing that
05:14 - since about october uh last year so
05:16 - almost a year now and it's it's really
05:18 - fun it's really interesting to see what
05:19 - articles we receive and and you know
05:21 - sort of curating them and helping them
05:22 - to you know the high standards we like
05:24 - to put up
05:25 - what is your editorial workflow like
05:29 - about how frequently will you check in
05:31 - and find articles that you're interested
05:32 - in editing and publishing
05:34 - i see so we do receive a lot of articles
05:36 - there's always something to work on
05:38 - um i i try and check in daily uh i
05:40 - actually take uh my lunch breaks at work
05:42 - uh as an opportunity to you know see
05:44 - what there is and review some of the
05:45 - articles and if i see one i think i can
05:47 - i can help you know edit them get to you
05:49 - know the standard we want then i'll you
05:52 - know i'll claim that article and in that
05:53 - evening i'll work on it and
05:55 - send it to abby for you know final
05:56 - review and publishing so that's
05:58 - thank you thanks peter
06:00 - have a seat richie
06:02 - just give us an overview of some of the
06:04 - things you do
06:05 - yeah so i mean
06:07 - we met a couple of years back
06:10 - you know
06:11 - free call cam was still in its early
06:12 - days and stuff
06:14 - so um so what i do currently is
06:18 - basically run meetups um i'm a core
06:21 - admin um
06:23 - for free call cam johannesburg
06:26 - uh there's a couple of other guys that
06:28 - some came and went and some are still
06:30 - there but some are dormant some are
06:31 - active we needed
06:33 - when needs be
06:35 - um but i'm generally like you know
06:37 - organize stuff and host the meetups
06:40 - themselves we're building uh we're
06:41 - building an events platform that'll make
06:43 - it easier for people in johannesburg
06:45 - when they're just using freecoatcamp to
06:48 - it'll remind them hey there's an event
06:50 - in uh you know at the nearby office uh
06:53 - where you're having your next event so
06:56 - i i'm optimistic that that will help
06:58 - even more people who are already in
07:00 - johannesburg who
07:02 - uh don't realize
07:04 - that you're having all these in-person
07:06 - events that will help get them involved
07:07 - as well
07:09 - absolutely
07:10 - um yeah i mean
07:14 - so like so
07:15 - another aspect of it i mean it's um we
07:17 - were talking about how else uh myself in
07:20 - the evidence we were talking about how
07:21 - else we can contribute like is is this
07:24 - all we can do
07:26 - you know is is that like how do we take
07:28 - it to the next level and i was like my
07:30 - response to that was like that's a very
07:31 - good question brother what do you think
07:34 - and um he's over there so he gave me his
07:38 - peace of mind but like for me i think
07:40 - for now is like we need to continue
07:42 - doing what we've been doing
07:44 - because
07:46 - personally i mean for me the the reason
07:48 - why i believe in this and why i'm still
07:50 - doing what i what i'm doing now
07:51 - is that i see value in this you know i
07:54 - truly believe like this
07:56 - is um
07:58 - one way that we can and i know it sounds
08:01 - very
08:02 - like up in the sky but like i really
08:04 - believe like this is one way of actually
08:06 - tackling poverty
08:08 - um and i see people that are frustrated
08:10 - in their jobs people that
08:13 - they just you know they just go to work
08:15 - just for the heck of it but they don't
08:17 - enjoy it you know and for me i strongly
08:19 - believe in that like you have to really
08:20 - enjoy what you do and i absolutely love
08:22 - what i'm doing right now and thanks to
08:24 - free code camp and i think the way just
08:27 - back to my original point was that um
08:29 - how to take it forward is first of all
08:31 - we need to keep doing what we're doing
08:33 - you know don't drop the standard and
08:35 - obviously think of other ways um of how
08:37 - we can improve it um whether it's um i
08:40 - don't know like just maybe writing
08:42 - articles if you would say you were doing
08:43 - like youtube stuff or you hosting
08:45 - meetups um maybe just you know think of
08:48 - other ways of contributing more or at
08:51 - least getting other people to feel the
08:53 - same passion that you have so that they
08:55 - can also continue and and contribute to
08:58 - the platform in in different ways
09:01 - richie it's been such a pleasure man
09:03 - thank you so much for flying out here
09:06 - well david you are a prolific uh
09:09 - writer among other things
09:11 - and
09:12 - i think you have a very interesting
09:13 - background
09:14 - can you tell the
09:16 - audience a little bit about yourself and
09:18 - how you got into coding and writing
09:20 - about code
09:21 - okay
09:22 - first of all quincy i'm really grateful
09:24 - to you that you created free code cam
09:26 - because i think it was really the major
09:28 - helper for me to switch my careers
09:30 - because as you mentioned i was working
09:32 - as a lawyer i have a law degree and then
09:33 - i was working as a lawyer for two years
09:36 - but then i got eventually a little bit
09:38 - frustrated and i was wondering what to
09:40 - do next so i was checking online courses
09:42 - and stuff and if i think first i checked
09:44 - some harvard course about cooking about
09:46 - molecular gastronomy and i spent like
09:48 - three months doing that but i said to me
09:50 - okay i cannot be cooked because i'm
09:52 - sweating and in the kitchen there's a
09:54 - lot of hot in here so i couldn't cook so
09:56 - i tried to watching for something else
09:58 - and then
09:59 - i find first some course on udemy about
10:03 - uh programming css html and javascript
10:05 - and i tried that
10:07 - but then it was just a tutorial you know
10:08 - building things that other people built
10:10 - so it was kind of it was great i got
10:12 - motivated but it was just the first
10:14 - level and then i discovered free code
10:16 - camp and those algorithms
10:18 - and it was basically a different
10:20 - dimension for me because before i was
10:22 - just creating stuff according to
10:24 - tutorials but with the with the
10:26 - algorithms i need to really understand
10:29 - and at first i got really frustrated
10:31 - because i think oh my god it's so
10:33 - difficult i cannot be developer but then
10:35 - it really just
10:37 - was better and better and finally i got
10:39 - really confident
10:40 - and really
10:42 - i started learning to code during the
10:44 - weekends and on the evenings
10:46 - and it eventually took me seven months
10:48 - to switch from a lawyer to developer
10:51 - just coding into on the weekends and the
10:53 - night so i'm really grateful for free
10:54 - coach ken because it really motivated me
10:56 - to see all the people doing the same
10:58 - thing
10:59 - is although so why i decide for
11:02 - contributing for free code cam by
11:03 - writing articles because
11:05 - you know a free code cam community
11:07 - helped me to become developer and i also
11:09 - wanted to contribute to it by
11:11 - by showing people concepts that were
11:13 - difficult for me so i try to like
11:15 - describe them in a way that are more
11:17 - understandable for me and in a way that
11:19 - i want them to be to see them when i
11:22 - learn them because there were no
11:23 - resources before
11:24 - yeah and that's i think the part of my
11:27 - story and maybe just
11:29 - the
11:30 - the main thing what i
11:32 - decided to change switch the careers was
11:33 - that as a lawyer i didn't see the
11:35 - results of my work
11:37 - and as a as a programmer i mean you
11:39 - write console.log and you see the result
11:41 - is it's so motivating you just write
11:44 - code and you see the result i love this
11:46 - and this is why i love programming
11:48 - cheers
11:50 - so tell us a little bit about uh about
11:52 - what you're working on out in portugal
11:55 - uh eduardo and you're leading the study
11:57 - group there
11:58 - well uh i i first knew free code camp in
12:01 - the beginning of 2017
12:03 - and i was a civil engineering
12:06 - and i was not happy with my career i
12:08 - wanted to reboot into into programming
12:11 - and when i'm at free code camp i'm at
12:13 - the right path
12:15 - uh to start learning how to program i've
12:17 - tried a lot of boot camps without effort
12:21 - but with free code camp it was very very
12:23 - easy to to follow follow up
12:26 - and and at the same time that i was
12:30 - studying
12:31 - uh i started to motivate people to study
12:33 - with me
12:34 - i started at the same time as jerome
12:36 - enrique and together we started the
12:39 - study group in our
12:41 - city
12:42 - uh and we impersonated also the starting
12:45 - of the study group in lisbon the capital
12:48 - of portugal
12:50 - and we are doing that effort
12:53 - every week
12:55 - even after we get got our jobs
12:58 - yeah i've rebooted my career in
13:02 - five months studying
13:04 - more or less 10 hours per day but it was
13:06 - uh
13:07 - nats it was five months and i got from
13:10 - civil engineering to a front-end
13:11 - developer
13:13 - how many people within your study group
13:15 - have gotten developer jobs do you think
13:17 - yeah
13:19 - first quincy let me tell you that we are
13:21 - in the south of portugal so it's a small
13:23 - town like 50 000
13:25 - inhabitants and
13:27 - in the last year we got five five
13:29 - developers ready to start working and
13:31 - they started working so i think it's a
13:33 - nice percentage
13:35 - so basically one out of 10 000 people in
13:38 - your town has gotten a developer job
13:40 - thanks largely to your efforts and your
13:42 - community outreach
13:44 - you're great yeah it was nice to meet
13:46 - you robert have a seat man thank you
13:49 - thank you
13:49 - you lead the free cocaine vienna group
13:52 - along with daniel deutsch who who
13:54 - couldn't make it uh he's a student
13:56 - uh tell us a little bit about the
13:59 - origins of free code camp vienna which i
14:01 - think you said is about three years old
14:02 - now yeah it is it is um
14:05 - yeah it's like there's so much to say
14:06 - but
14:07 - um
14:08 - it basically started i i
14:12 - now have a developer job and i mainly
14:14 - attribute that to free code camp which
14:16 - is awesome
14:17 - and when i started as a student
14:19 - shortly after there's this there was i
14:22 - think it still is that this is getting
14:23 - started guide and you're getting courage
14:24 - to check up your local group there was
14:26 - no local group but there was a nice
14:27 - guide saying if there is no local group
14:29 - start a facebook group this is how you
14:31 - do it so i did
14:32 - uh and then
14:34 - no one came so i asked my wife to join i
14:36 - invited her we were two then like this
14:38 - is probably just in the span of a couple
14:39 - of days
14:40 - there were still no more people joining
14:42 - so i got impatient so i think i texted
14:44 - you on gitzer or something i was like i
14:46 - don't know if quincy larson will reply
14:47 - to me but he replied and it was awesome
14:50 - and i was asking can i start a
14:51 - meetup.com group because i knew meetups
14:53 - from my city there's a quite a bit of
14:55 - them
14:56 - thinking that that's the way i could get
14:58 - more people involved because i wanted to
14:59 - meet other students right
15:01 - um and then i did that and you replied
15:04 - like yeah of course sure just keep in
15:05 - mind it cost money and stuff and i was
15:06 - like that's fine
15:08 - so that's basically how it started in
15:10 - the format that we have now
15:12 - we've been going almost three years like
15:14 - this i think november or december
15:17 - take care all right thank you well
15:18 - elephant thank you so much for flying in
15:20 - from greece
15:22 - you are a very prominent person in the
15:24 - freco camp community especially recently
15:27 - you've been live streaming a whole lot
15:29 - of
15:30 - videos you've been creating videos
15:33 - on things like angular
15:35 - it's
15:36 - it's incredibly helpful tell us a little
15:38 - about how you got into tech and how you
15:41 - started
15:42 - deciding to record all this and share
15:44 - all this knowledge okay
15:46 - uh well i wanted to learn and firstly i
15:49 - wanted to learn
15:50 - for me and for myself but i knew that
15:54 - eventually i wanted to find a job and i
15:57 - wanted to be sure that everything i know
15:59 - i can also uh like
16:02 - go to another person and maybe teach
16:04 - them so i said okay how can i do that so
16:07 - let's start coding in my computer as
16:10 - always and then i'm going to record
16:11 - these videos and if they're very good
16:13 - then i'm going to upload them so
16:16 - basically that's how i started i wanted
16:18 - to pass this knowledge to other people
16:20 - and make sure that i also know these
16:22 - things thank you very much
16:25 - ben is
16:27 - a prolific contributor to free code camp
16:29 - i think i've spent more time pairing
16:31 - with him than pretty much anybody in the
16:33 - free code camp community
16:36 - uh gosh let me let me let me just let me
16:39 - just recount some of the things you
16:40 - worked on so
16:41 - you were
16:42 - you were very heavily involved in the
16:44 - javascript
16:46 - curriculum which pretty much everybody
16:47 - who's watching this has probably tried
16:48 - at some point um
16:51 - you created the challenge-o-matic which
16:53 - was the tool to make it easier to
16:54 - contribute challenges well tell us a
16:56 - little about yourself you're here in
16:58 - dublin right yeah yeah so i am based
17:00 - here i am currently kind of a college
17:02 - student uh detergent my degree is all
17:05 - work placement
17:07 - so i'm currently a working man for a
17:09 - year
17:10 - in kernel development actually which is
17:12 - a complete pivot from javascript but
17:15 - yeah well what are some things that uh
17:18 - aside from kernel development and
17:20 - hopefully getting back into free co camp
17:23 - contribution what are some areas of
17:24 - technology since you're somebody who
17:26 - is you know at many different places in
17:29 - the stack and has a pretty good
17:31 - bird's eye view on on how things are
17:33 - moving what are some things that really
17:35 - excite you about
17:37 - tech information technology and the way
17:38 - things are going
17:43 - in terms of new things um i guess
17:46 - there's a lot of scope for
17:49 - i guess
17:50 - like this is trying to unlock but the
17:51 - tight integration of
17:53 - technology and people
17:55 - i feel like there's a lot of issues that
17:57 - are
17:58 - are not serious enough that they needed
17:59 - a solution in the past
18:01 - but it becomes so easy to solve that
18:02 - they will be
18:03 - um
18:05 - a great example is the the whole health
18:07 - technology kind of revolution the way
18:09 - everyone's getting their heart rate
18:10 - constantly about and all that kind of
18:11 - stuff and there's been many cases of
18:13 - people fighting that they have asip or
18:16 - atrial fibrillation if you want the full
18:17 - global thing uh because of their smart
18:19 - watch i think there's an article really
18:20 - really about an apple watch that alerted
18:22 - a person to it um and it's stuff like
18:24 - that that can you know makes huge
18:26 - differences to lives because they're you
18:28 - know if you find that you've atrial
18:29 - fibrillation you need to get it sorted
18:30 - and it's fine
18:32 - if you sort it and if you don't you get
18:33 - yourself a lot of trouble so
18:35 - there's all kinds of applications of
18:37 - health technology in particular that are
18:39 - not only really exciting because they're
18:40 - cool but they're also really exciting
18:41 - because they're good they're doing a
18:43 - good thing in the world
18:46 - quincy it's great to talk to you live
18:48 - yeah matt uh tell us a little bit about
18:50 - uh your background
18:52 - and what you're doing
18:54 - so i'm i'm originally a music teacher i
18:56 - studied music at university
18:58 - um taught guitar on piano for several
19:01 - years
19:02 - um and then which i still do actually
19:03 - just a little bit um in the evenings and
19:05 - weekends um but i realized um
19:10 - it wasn't the career for me i wanted
19:12 - something which had a bit more direction
19:13 - had more of a challenge
19:15 - um
19:16 - and i met a friend who i'd not seen in a
19:18 - long time and
19:19 - uh he studied music with me and he was
19:21 - like oh i'm a developer now like how did
19:23 - how did that happen and uh i knew that
19:25 - well i found a lot of courses online and
19:28 - sort of taught myself and then a couple
19:29 - of years later and developed first it's
19:31 - incredible and uh so
19:33 - i started just looking around different
19:34 - resources um
19:36 - and
19:37 - this was
19:39 - so this was uh like three and a half
19:40 - years ago four years ago
19:42 - um so i was started with
19:45 - a lot of courses on coursera edx and
19:46 - those kind of things which were really
19:48 - good because they had these kind of
19:49 - deadlines so you had to get the
19:52 - project in by a certain time and then
19:54 - people peer-reviewed them
19:56 - um
19:56 - and then listened to a lot of podcasts
19:58 - and i think
20:00 - i feel it was probably javascript java
20:02 - you were on and you were talking about
20:03 - free codecamp or maybe it was code
20:05 - newbie maybe both
20:06 - and um and i heard about free code camp
20:08 - and started trying that out and and
20:11 - realized actually this is this
20:12 - incredible free platform um
20:16 - and yeah just got really into it and got
20:19 - quite disciplined about doing it every
20:21 - day
20:22 - and then uh and then i heard about these
20:24 - meetups that were going on and um which
20:27 - at first i was i'm not good enough to go
20:29 - along to these i bet everyone's amazing
20:30 - and
20:31 - you know very
20:33 - uh i was quite intimidated but i forced
20:35 - myself to go
20:36 - and then met people who were very
20:38 - similar to me you know some people who
20:39 - were above me some people who weren't
20:41 - quite where i was and
20:42 - um and found that really and suddenly it
20:45 - was oh you know maybe i can do this and
20:49 - yeah it's gone from there really
20:51 - that's awesome so
20:53 - describe the transition uh
20:56 - you're a musician
20:58 - and just
21:00 - looking at
21:01 - the different steps you would need to
21:02 - take and planning out your progression
21:04 - as
21:05 - it became clear and clear to you what
21:07 - you needed to do yeah
21:09 - i think yeah to begin with it's it's
21:10 - fine just to
21:12 - accept you're not going to learn
21:13 - everything in one go i think some people
21:14 - think they maybe do it for a week and
21:17 - think
21:18 - i feel like i don't know too much yeah
21:20 - i'm never gonna be able to do this it's
21:21 - so this just it can be overwhelming
21:23 - um it's good just to yeah just do it
21:25 - initially which i think i did
21:27 - just to try a few things out and just
21:29 - just enjoy it really not necessarily i
21:31 - mean think i need to do this and become
21:33 - a developer as soon as possible i think
21:34 - it's good to take your time just to
21:37 - yeah try try some things out and but
21:39 - then as you
21:41 - enjoy it more hopefully and get a sense
21:42 - that it is what you want to do
21:44 - trying to um
21:47 - find ways to keep yourself motivated in
21:48 - my case it was initially doing these
21:50 - courses which had deadlines at the end
21:52 - of the week
21:53 - and then in the meetups thinking okay
21:55 - there's another meetup in two weeks i'd
21:57 - like to be able to show
21:59 - something to someone by then
22:01 - you know sometimes you feel like if you
22:02 - go along and you've not done anything
22:03 - since last time it's like oh you know i
22:05 - should have done it it's a nice kind of
22:07 - motivator having some peers around you
22:10 - i think it's very easy to sort of
22:12 - stay by yourself and
22:14 - get a bit isolated but you know what we
22:16 - try and encourage with the meetups is to
22:18 - get people to come along and just
22:20 - you know
22:21 - talk to people um
22:24 - see where everyone else is don't feel
22:26 - shy about it everyone's there to help
22:28 - each other we're not about
22:30 - you know criticizing i mean it might be
22:32 - constructive criticism but um
22:35 - yeah
22:36 - thanks again matt
22:37 - knows timo is a prolific contributor i
22:39 - think i was talking about you earlier
22:41 - when we were going around in the circle
22:42 - but you've contributed an incredible
22:44 - amount and if you look on the github
22:46 - repo and look
22:47 - rank everything by commits you're way up
22:49 - there what are some
22:51 - of the ways that you've contributed to
22:52 - the free cooking community
22:54 - over the past year and a half or so
22:57 - so when it started out it was almost
22:59 - exactly two years ago now um
23:02 - i started with making small changes
23:04 - mostly to the curriculum uh small fixes
23:07 - to the test mostly so it was a test that
23:10 - was missing correct uh solutions or it
23:13 - was allowing
23:15 - solutions that shouldn't be allowed
23:17 - i try to fix those and that's mostly
23:19 - what i started out doing and then
23:21 - i found out about the freak out game
23:22 - guide being developed and actually you
23:24 - had quite a bit of time at the time that
23:26 - it uh
23:28 - was the next development and uh
23:30 - i got involved and i spent a lot of time
23:33 - on uh contributing to the freak out
23:34 - combined to the platform not the
23:36 - articles the content but to the platform
23:39 - the site around it
23:41 - yeah well thanks for all your articles
23:44 - so far sam they've been they've been
23:45 - great
23:46 - and very well received by the community
23:49 - yeah thank you virtually like the first
23:50 - article i wrote i was
23:52 - i wrote it just because i was in china
23:54 - and
23:56 - i hated the great the great firewall of
23:58 - china and i sent it to you and said can
24:00 - you have a look and you said you loved
24:02 - it and actually made me an author on the
24:05 - uh on the free code camp media mask on
24:07 - the medium publication
24:09 - and
24:10 - that just gave me the boost i needed
24:12 - every other article before that i got
24:14 - like 5 10 maybe 15 viewers
24:18 - getting on the free code camp thing
24:20 - boosted me and gave me the confidence to
24:21 - write more and that was really big for
24:23 - me
24:25 - what would be your advice to those
24:27 - people who already have kind of a
24:29 - traditional engineering training but are
24:31 - interested in pivoting into software
24:33 - development
24:34 - if you're interested in pivoting into
24:36 - software
24:37 - at all
24:38 - give it a try
24:40 - stuff like free code camp and there's
24:42 - hundreds of other free resources out
24:44 - there they're all absolutely brilliant i
24:47 - learn
24:48 - most of the stuff i know now through
24:50 - free code camp it's free it has
24:52 - step-by-step tutorials that give you
24:54 - really good feedback as you're
24:56 - progressing through
24:58 - and
24:59 - the worst that happens is you try it out
25:01 - you do two or three months
25:03 - and you find that you don't enjoy it
25:04 - that much thanks again for coming out
25:06 - man it's great great to finally meet you
25:07 - richard i'm so thrilled we've talked so
25:10 - many times we've been in touch
25:12 - richard is in charge of pre-co camp
25:15 - leads
25:16 - pre-code cam oslo
25:18 - and the free cocaine instagram which has
25:21 - i don't know 10 000 ish
25:23 - like 13 and a half or something now
25:25 - somebody dropping 13s i think yeah yeah
25:28 - and it's
25:29 - it's great photos of
25:30 - freco camp events and just beautiful
25:33 - workstations and code setups and things
25:36 - like that yeah all that stuff all the
25:37 - good stuff
25:39 - yeah what are your goals so you really
25:42 - took charge on the instagram and
25:44 - i mean you owned it
25:46 - for
25:47 - you were already very prolific on
25:49 - instagram you had a lot of your own
25:51 - photos you had a ton of followers
25:52 - yourself
25:53 - and you really took the free cocaine
25:55 - instagram which was largely just
25:57 - chilling there because
25:58 - i think i was the only person who had
26:00 - access to it at the time and and
26:02 - and now it's it's quite vibrant and
26:04 - there's a lot of beautiful photos on
26:06 - there
26:07 - can you describe that process of
26:09 - thinking like hey maybe i could help out
26:11 - with this and and how you went about it
26:14 - yes so i think um people took it from
26:17 - about three thousand at the time uh are
26:19 - you saying it was like underutilized i
26:21 - think the thing i think you were
26:23 - very um
26:26 - very very good on twitter and things
26:27 - like that that stuff was doing it um and
26:30 - what i was doing
26:32 - on my own instagram
26:34 - uh was just pictures of my code stuff
26:37 - i'm working on
26:38 - um
26:40 - and things like that so
26:42 - we had the conversation about doing some
26:44 - stuff for the free code campaign to it
26:46 - have a lot more of the community stuff
26:47 - in there as well
26:49 - trying to
26:51 - re-upload other people's pictures um
26:54 - re-gram them or whatever they call that
26:56 - um so that's kind of what we tried to do
26:58 - get the community thing more in there
27:01 - and just try and
27:03 - try and build that up and have a bit
27:04 - more of a community a bit more so other
27:06 - people could um
27:08 - you know get involved in that as well so
27:09 - that was the plan yeah
27:11 - yeah and uh early on you you made it a
27:14 - clear point that people could basically
27:15 - add mention free code camper hashtag
27:17 - freako camp on instagram and we could
27:20 - basically signal boost
27:21 - their photos and and of course credit
27:23 - them and everything uh
27:25 - are people still doing that pretty
27:27 - regularly we need them to do it more
27:29 - do it more
27:31 - especially to do with
27:33 - if there's meetups going on
27:35 - that stuff's great so if we've got a
27:37 - meet up and you've got a picture of all
27:38 - the groups and stuff like that
27:40 - we love that stuff so like send those
27:42 - stuff but um
27:43 - yeah
27:44 - i'm constantly going in there checking
27:45 - the hashtags or if you've been tagging
27:47 - us in them directly as well trying to
27:49 - find the good stuff out there and
27:50 - posting it on there so um
27:53 - if if people send me the good stuff then
27:55 - it means i don't have to do anything so
27:57 - that's kind of what we want to do for
27:59 - sure
28:00 - for everything you're doing richard
28:02 - andera has contributed extensively to
28:05 - free code camp uh through the free co
28:07 - camp guide and also publishing articles
28:10 - on medium tell us a little bit about
28:11 - yourself and how you discovered free
28:14 - code camp and decided to contribute to
28:15 - it
28:16 - okay um at the moment i'm a student
28:19 - actually just started like last week
28:21 - university um the
28:23 - my journey with frequent camp started
28:25 - when i um moved from like g sharp to
28:28 - javascript because i needed to learn
28:30 - node.js for like a server application
28:34 - and uh i basically discovered frequent
28:36 - camp to learn javascript then
28:39 - i started like reading the articles on
28:41 - the medium publication
28:43 - and when i decided that i wanted to also
28:47 - write articles it just felt natural to
28:50 - go
28:51 - to publish the articles on the media
28:53 - publication
28:54 - and then from there like the involvement
28:57 - with the community just like grew uh
29:00 - gradually yeah how old are you
29:02 - 18.
29:03 - oh wow
29:04 - you're getting really into
29:06 - uh really deep into technology pretty
29:07 - young and that's that's excellent
29:10 - yeah i actually like started my first
29:14 - experiences with coding like at 12. um
29:18 - the story goes basically oh i like games
29:22 - why not make one and then like i just
29:24 - started with the software that lets you
29:28 - just create the game with drag and drop
29:30 - stuff
29:31 - and then you say oh i want to add this
29:34 - like cool feature i will learn some
29:36 - scripting and then oh
29:38 - program is super cool i will learn this
29:40 - all right cheers all right
29:42 - i'll just grab the camera
29:45 - um
29:47 - so
29:47 - matt's over here we're gonna take a big
29:49 - group photo and then we're gonna
29:50 - gracefully leave
29:52 - [Music]
29:54 - thank you so much for tuning in for the
29:56 - stream we got to talk to a lot of
29:58 - exciting people doing exciting work both
30:01 - within the free cocaine community and
30:03 - just working as developers
30:05 - so i hope you all have a beautiful
30:07 - evening

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to the free code camp 2018 top contributors party in dublin yeah here before we get started i have some very quick announcements uh things that are coming up very soon that i think everybody who's interested in free code camp should know first of all just like last year when free co camp participated in hacktoberfest and hacktoberfest is the month of october it's a big push to get people to contribute to open source last year free code camps guide was the number one most contributed to open source repo as part of hacktoberfest we're taking a lot of the existing repositories we've got learn we've got curriculum we've got the free codecamp slash recording at the main repository uh and then we've got the guide we're working to unify these repos into a single repository that will make it easier for everybody to get the local free code camp running a couple other announcements since you are watching this on the youtube channel according to like the youtube analytics we looked at free code camp is now the fastest growing programming youtube channel uh yeah and we are getting about 50 000 new subscribers a month if you create compelling videos about programming and you're interested we would love to help more people see your instagram content your videos so just reach out to us and we can make that happen but for us we want to put as many amazing videos on youtube as we can we're here in dublin we're at i've got a cool sign for it the huckle tree which is a really cool hipster name i'm gonna try to talk to as many of you all as possible and just interview you and learn more about you so hey i'm here with brianna swift you have been involved with freco camp since basically the beginning maybe you can just give us a high level overview of your involvement with free code camp and and your transition into being a developer yeah so i found free code camp uh while i was an elementary school music teacher i was trying to learn how to code i love kids i love teaching music but i knew it wasn't a career that i wanted to do forever so i was like what can i learn how to do without having to quit my job and go back to school because i couldn't afford to do that and i thought the people that make the internet are probably the first ones to put all of that information for free on the internet um so i did code academy mostly javascript type stuff and found my way onto free code camp i was really involved on twitter that was my only community because i was really kind of alone while i was learning and went through the free code camp challenges and as soon as i started doing that i started to get involved more in the chat room which there was no forum at that point and started doing some pair programming and streaming that so free code camp really not only taught me the fundamentals that i needed for you know for development and for software but also gave me a community and a place to you know commiserate almost with how hard it is to learn how to code and based on your videos on youtube and the skills that you were able to build up just learning the code on your own and through different communities you were able to eventually get a job can you talk a little bit about your job and how you got it yeah yes i work at github which is not where i thought i would be working when i started learning to code i'm a trainer so most of the time i'm talking to developers about how to use git and github so regardless of what language they're programming in regardless of what type of projects how big their team is everybody should probably be using version control and git is not the simplest thing to wrap your head around so it's a similar challenge to these computer science concepts like how can we make this simple and approachable um this you know that transition was weird because going from elementary school music teacher to working at github is kind of a jump but but i think working with those videos specifically and saying how can we take these difficult concepts and make them approachable to anybody is something that really primed me for working at github so i think even if somebody's going through free code camp and if you're going through free code camp and you're like i don't know if i necessarily see myself as a fulltime developer that's okay like there are so many places for you that are perfect for you that you might just not know exist like i didn't know that this job existed but i love it awesome thanks again thank you quincy why don't you just tell us a little about yourself pete sure so my name is pete and i'm a data scientist based in london and i uh write for and help edit the medium publication i've been doing that since about october uh last year so almost a year now and it's it's really fun it's really interesting to see what articles we receive and and you know sort of curating them and helping them to you know the high standards we like to put up what is your editorial workflow like about how frequently will you check in and find articles that you're interested in editing and publishing i see so we do receive a lot of articles there's always something to work on um i i try and check in daily uh i actually take uh my lunch breaks at work uh as an opportunity to you know see what there is and review some of the articles and if i see one i think i can i can help you know edit them get to you know the standard we want then i'll you know i'll claim that article and in that evening i'll work on it and send it to abby for you know final review and publishing so that's thank you thanks peter have a seat richie just give us an overview of some of the things you do yeah so i mean we met a couple of years back you know free call cam was still in its early days and stuff so um so what i do currently is basically run meetups um i'm a core admin um for free call cam johannesburg uh there's a couple of other guys that some came and went and some are still there but some are dormant some are active we needed when needs be um but i'm generally like you know organize stuff and host the meetups themselves we're building uh we're building an events platform that'll make it easier for people in johannesburg when they're just using freecoatcamp to it'll remind them hey there's an event in uh you know at the nearby office uh where you're having your next event so i i'm optimistic that that will help even more people who are already in johannesburg who uh don't realize that you're having all these inperson events that will help get them involved as well absolutely um yeah i mean so like so another aspect of it i mean it's um we were talking about how else uh myself in the evidence we were talking about how else we can contribute like is is this all we can do you know is is that like how do we take it to the next level and i was like my response to that was like that's a very good question brother what do you think and um he's over there so he gave me his peace of mind but like for me i think for now is like we need to continue doing what we've been doing because personally i mean for me the the reason why i believe in this and why i'm still doing what i what i'm doing now is that i see value in this you know i truly believe like this is um one way that we can and i know it sounds very like up in the sky but like i really believe like this is one way of actually tackling poverty um and i see people that are frustrated in their jobs people that they just you know they just go to work just for the heck of it but they don't enjoy it you know and for me i strongly believe in that like you have to really enjoy what you do and i absolutely love what i'm doing right now and thanks to free code camp and i think the way just back to my original point was that um how to take it forward is first of all we need to keep doing what we're doing you know don't drop the standard and obviously think of other ways um of how we can improve it um whether it's um i don't know like just maybe writing articles if you would say you were doing like youtube stuff or you hosting meetups um maybe just you know think of other ways of contributing more or at least getting other people to feel the same passion that you have so that they can also continue and and contribute to the platform in in different ways richie it's been such a pleasure man thank you so much for flying out here well david you are a prolific uh writer among other things and i think you have a very interesting background can you tell the audience a little bit about yourself and how you got into coding and writing about code okay first of all quincy i'm really grateful to you that you created free code cam because i think it was really the major helper for me to switch my careers because as you mentioned i was working as a lawyer i have a law degree and then i was working as a lawyer for two years but then i got eventually a little bit frustrated and i was wondering what to do next so i was checking online courses and stuff and if i think first i checked some harvard course about cooking about molecular gastronomy and i spent like three months doing that but i said to me okay i cannot be cooked because i'm sweating and in the kitchen there's a lot of hot in here so i couldn't cook so i tried to watching for something else and then i find first some course on udemy about uh programming css html and javascript and i tried that but then it was just a tutorial you know building things that other people built so it was kind of it was great i got motivated but it was just the first level and then i discovered free code camp and those algorithms and it was basically a different dimension for me because before i was just creating stuff according to tutorials but with the with the algorithms i need to really understand and at first i got really frustrated because i think oh my god it's so difficult i cannot be developer but then it really just was better and better and finally i got really confident and really i started learning to code during the weekends and on the evenings and it eventually took me seven months to switch from a lawyer to developer just coding into on the weekends and the night so i'm really grateful for free coach ken because it really motivated me to see all the people doing the same thing is although so why i decide for contributing for free code cam by writing articles because you know a free code cam community helped me to become developer and i also wanted to contribute to it by by showing people concepts that were difficult for me so i try to like describe them in a way that are more understandable for me and in a way that i want them to be to see them when i learn them because there were no resources before yeah and that's i think the part of my story and maybe just the the main thing what i decided to change switch the careers was that as a lawyer i didn't see the results of my work and as a as a programmer i mean you write console.log and you see the result is it's so motivating you just write code and you see the result i love this and this is why i love programming cheers so tell us a little bit about uh about what you're working on out in portugal uh eduardo and you're leading the study group there well uh i i first knew free code camp in the beginning of 2017 and i was a civil engineering and i was not happy with my career i wanted to reboot into into programming and when i'm at free code camp i'm at the right path uh to start learning how to program i've tried a lot of boot camps without effort but with free code camp it was very very easy to to follow follow up and and at the same time that i was studying uh i started to motivate people to study with me i started at the same time as jerome enrique and together we started the study group in our city uh and we impersonated also the starting of the study group in lisbon the capital of portugal and we are doing that effort every week even after we get got our jobs yeah i've rebooted my career in five months studying more or less 10 hours per day but it was uh nats it was five months and i got from civil engineering to a frontend developer how many people within your study group have gotten developer jobs do you think yeah first quincy let me tell you that we are in the south of portugal so it's a small town like 50 000 inhabitants and in the last year we got five five developers ready to start working and they started working so i think it's a nice percentage so basically one out of 10 000 people in your town has gotten a developer job thanks largely to your efforts and your community outreach you're great yeah it was nice to meet you robert have a seat man thank you thank you you lead the free cocaine vienna group along with daniel deutsch who who couldn't make it uh he's a student uh tell us a little bit about the origins of free code camp vienna which i think you said is about three years old now yeah it is it is um yeah it's like there's so much to say but um it basically started i i now have a developer job and i mainly attribute that to free code camp which is awesome and when i started as a student shortly after there's this there was i think it still is that this is getting started guide and you're getting courage to check up your local group there was no local group but there was a nice guide saying if there is no local group start a facebook group this is how you do it so i did uh and then no one came so i asked my wife to join i invited her we were two then like this is probably just in the span of a couple of days there were still no more people joining so i got impatient so i think i texted you on gitzer or something i was like i don't know if quincy larson will reply to me but he replied and it was awesome and i was asking can i start a meetup.com group because i knew meetups from my city there's a quite a bit of them thinking that that's the way i could get more people involved because i wanted to meet other students right um and then i did that and you replied like yeah of course sure just keep in mind it cost money and stuff and i was like that's fine so that's basically how it started in the format that we have now we've been going almost three years like this i think november or december take care all right thank you well elephant thank you so much for flying in from greece you are a very prominent person in the freco camp community especially recently you've been live streaming a whole lot of videos you've been creating videos on things like angular it's it's incredibly helpful tell us a little about how you got into tech and how you started deciding to record all this and share all this knowledge okay uh well i wanted to learn and firstly i wanted to learn for me and for myself but i knew that eventually i wanted to find a job and i wanted to be sure that everything i know i can also uh like go to another person and maybe teach them so i said okay how can i do that so let's start coding in my computer as always and then i'm going to record these videos and if they're very good then i'm going to upload them so basically that's how i started i wanted to pass this knowledge to other people and make sure that i also know these things thank you very much ben is a prolific contributor to free code camp i think i've spent more time pairing with him than pretty much anybody in the free code camp community uh gosh let me let me let me just let me just recount some of the things you worked on so you were you were very heavily involved in the javascript curriculum which pretty much everybody who's watching this has probably tried at some point um you created the challengeomatic which was the tool to make it easier to contribute challenges well tell us a little about yourself you're here in dublin right yeah yeah so i am based here i am currently kind of a college student uh detergent my degree is all work placement so i'm currently a working man for a year in kernel development actually which is a complete pivot from javascript but yeah well what are some things that uh aside from kernel development and hopefully getting back into free co camp contribution what are some areas of technology since you're somebody who is you know at many different places in the stack and has a pretty good bird's eye view on on how things are moving what are some things that really excite you about tech information technology and the way things are going in terms of new things um i guess there's a lot of scope for i guess like this is trying to unlock but the tight integration of technology and people i feel like there's a lot of issues that are are not serious enough that they needed a solution in the past but it becomes so easy to solve that they will be um a great example is the the whole health technology kind of revolution the way everyone's getting their heart rate constantly about and all that kind of stuff and there's been many cases of people fighting that they have asip or atrial fibrillation if you want the full global thing uh because of their smart watch i think there's an article really really about an apple watch that alerted a person to it um and it's stuff like that that can you know makes huge differences to lives because they're you know if you find that you've atrial fibrillation you need to get it sorted and it's fine if you sort it and if you don't you get yourself a lot of trouble so there's all kinds of applications of health technology in particular that are not only really exciting because they're cool but they're also really exciting because they're good they're doing a good thing in the world quincy it's great to talk to you live yeah matt uh tell us a little bit about uh your background and what you're doing so i'm i'm originally a music teacher i studied music at university um taught guitar on piano for several years um and then which i still do actually just a little bit um in the evenings and weekends um but i realized um it wasn't the career for me i wanted something which had a bit more direction had more of a challenge um and i met a friend who i'd not seen in a long time and uh he studied music with me and he was like oh i'm a developer now like how did how did that happen and uh i knew that well i found a lot of courses online and sort of taught myself and then a couple of years later and developed first it's incredible and uh so i started just looking around different resources um and this was so this was uh like three and a half years ago four years ago um so i was started with a lot of courses on coursera edx and those kind of things which were really good because they had these kind of deadlines so you had to get the project in by a certain time and then people peerreviewed them um and then listened to a lot of podcasts and i think i feel it was probably javascript java you were on and you were talking about free codecamp or maybe it was code newbie maybe both and um and i heard about free code camp and started trying that out and and realized actually this is this incredible free platform um and yeah just got really into it and got quite disciplined about doing it every day and then uh and then i heard about these meetups that were going on and um which at first i was i'm not good enough to go along to these i bet everyone's amazing and you know very uh i was quite intimidated but i forced myself to go and then met people who were very similar to me you know some people who were above me some people who weren't quite where i was and um and found that really and suddenly it was oh you know maybe i can do this and yeah it's gone from there really that's awesome so describe the transition uh you're a musician and just looking at the different steps you would need to take and planning out your progression as it became clear and clear to you what you needed to do yeah i think yeah to begin with it's it's fine just to accept you're not going to learn everything in one go i think some people think they maybe do it for a week and think i feel like i don't know too much yeah i'm never gonna be able to do this it's so this just it can be overwhelming um it's good just to yeah just do it initially which i think i did just to try a few things out and just just enjoy it really not necessarily i mean think i need to do this and become a developer as soon as possible i think it's good to take your time just to yeah try try some things out and but then as you enjoy it more hopefully and get a sense that it is what you want to do trying to um find ways to keep yourself motivated in my case it was initially doing these courses which had deadlines at the end of the week and then in the meetups thinking okay there's another meetup in two weeks i'd like to be able to show something to someone by then you know sometimes you feel like if you go along and you've not done anything since last time it's like oh you know i should have done it it's a nice kind of motivator having some peers around you i think it's very easy to sort of stay by yourself and get a bit isolated but you know what we try and encourage with the meetups is to get people to come along and just you know talk to people um see where everyone else is don't feel shy about it everyone's there to help each other we're not about you know criticizing i mean it might be constructive criticism but um yeah thanks again matt knows timo is a prolific contributor i think i was talking about you earlier when we were going around in the circle but you've contributed an incredible amount and if you look on the github repo and look rank everything by commits you're way up there what are some of the ways that you've contributed to the free cooking community over the past year and a half or so so when it started out it was almost exactly two years ago now um i started with making small changes mostly to the curriculum uh small fixes to the test mostly so it was a test that was missing correct uh solutions or it was allowing solutions that shouldn't be allowed i try to fix those and that's mostly what i started out doing and then i found out about the freak out game guide being developed and actually you had quite a bit of time at the time that it uh was the next development and uh i got involved and i spent a lot of time on uh contributing to the freak out combined to the platform not the articles the content but to the platform the site around it yeah well thanks for all your articles so far sam they've been they've been great and very well received by the community yeah thank you virtually like the first article i wrote i was i wrote it just because i was in china and i hated the great the great firewall of china and i sent it to you and said can you have a look and you said you loved it and actually made me an author on the uh on the free code camp media mask on the medium publication and that just gave me the boost i needed every other article before that i got like 5 10 maybe 15 viewers getting on the free code camp thing boosted me and gave me the confidence to write more and that was really big for me what would be your advice to those people who already have kind of a traditional engineering training but are interested in pivoting into software development if you're interested in pivoting into software at all give it a try stuff like free code camp and there's hundreds of other free resources out there they're all absolutely brilliant i learn most of the stuff i know now through free code camp it's free it has stepbystep tutorials that give you really good feedback as you're progressing through and the worst that happens is you try it out you do two or three months and you find that you don't enjoy it that much thanks again for coming out man it's great great to finally meet you richard i'm so thrilled we've talked so many times we've been in touch richard is in charge of preco camp leads precode cam oslo and the free cocaine instagram which has i don't know 10 000 ish like 13 and a half or something now somebody dropping 13s i think yeah yeah and it's it's great photos of freco camp events and just beautiful workstations and code setups and things like that yeah all that stuff all the good stuff yeah what are your goals so you really took charge on the instagram and i mean you owned it for you were already very prolific on instagram you had a lot of your own photos you had a ton of followers yourself and you really took the free cocaine instagram which was largely just chilling there because i think i was the only person who had access to it at the time and and and now it's it's quite vibrant and there's a lot of beautiful photos on there can you describe that process of thinking like hey maybe i could help out with this and and how you went about it yes so i think um people took it from about three thousand at the time uh are you saying it was like underutilized i think the thing i think you were very um very very good on twitter and things like that that stuff was doing it um and what i was doing on my own instagram uh was just pictures of my code stuff i'm working on um and things like that so we had the conversation about doing some stuff for the free code campaign to it have a lot more of the community stuff in there as well trying to reupload other people's pictures um regram them or whatever they call that um so that's kind of what we tried to do get the community thing more in there and just try and try and build that up and have a bit more of a community a bit more so other people could um you know get involved in that as well so that was the plan yeah yeah and uh early on you you made it a clear point that people could basically add mention free code camper hashtag freako camp on instagram and we could basically signal boost their photos and and of course credit them and everything uh are people still doing that pretty regularly we need them to do it more do it more especially to do with if there's meetups going on that stuff's great so if we've got a meet up and you've got a picture of all the groups and stuff like that we love that stuff so like send those stuff but um yeah i'm constantly going in there checking the hashtags or if you've been tagging us in them directly as well trying to find the good stuff out there and posting it on there so um if if people send me the good stuff then it means i don't have to do anything so that's kind of what we want to do for sure for everything you're doing richard andera has contributed extensively to free code camp uh through the free co camp guide and also publishing articles on medium tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered free code camp and decided to contribute to it okay um at the moment i'm a student actually just started like last week university um the my journey with frequent camp started when i um moved from like g sharp to javascript because i needed to learn node.js for like a server application and uh i basically discovered frequent camp to learn javascript then i started like reading the articles on the medium publication and when i decided that i wanted to also write articles it just felt natural to go to publish the articles on the media publication and then from there like the involvement with the community just like grew uh gradually yeah how old are you 18. oh wow you're getting really into uh really deep into technology pretty young and that's that's excellent yeah i actually like started my first experiences with coding like at 12. um the story goes basically oh i like games why not make one and then like i just started with the software that lets you just create the game with drag and drop stuff and then you say oh i want to add this like cool feature i will learn some scripting and then oh program is super cool i will learn this all right cheers all right i'll just grab the camera um so matt's over here we're gonna take a big group photo and then we're gonna gracefully leave thank you so much for tuning in for the stream we got to talk to a lot of exciting people doing exciting work both within the free cocaine community and just working as developers so i hope you all have a beautiful evening
