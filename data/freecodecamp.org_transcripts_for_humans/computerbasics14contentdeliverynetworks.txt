00:23 - user
00:24 - when i first was learning about cdns i
00:26 - got really confused because i thought
00:28 - well doesn't everybody benefit from that
00:30 - who's paying for the service is that the
00:32 - user that will pay for a cdn to make
00:34 - their internet faster
00:36 - or is that the website that pays a cdn
00:39 - to deliver their content and it's the
00:41 - latter
00:42 - a cdn is hired by a website or in some
00:45 - cases developed by a website it's its
00:47 - own cdn

01:02 - sites to make the user experience faster
01:05 - an example of a cdn that you should know
01:08 - about as a developer is how google hosts
01:11 - languages like jquery
01:13 - if you link to jquery from google's
01:15 - library instead of uploading it yourself
01:17 - to your site that's going to be way
01:19 - faster for your user
01:21 - additionally if another site has used
01:24 - that same cdn for jquery it might be
01:27 - stored in that user's browser so it
01:29 - doesn't even have to load again at all
01:32 - as a user you need to know that cdns are
01:34 - everywhere you probably use cdns all the
01:37 - time without really even needing to be
01:39 - aware of it as a developer it's
01:41 - important for things like the languages
01:43 - that are hosted on google libraries you
01:46 - can use those in your sites and create a
01:47 - much faster user experience with less
01:50 - work on your end than before
01:52 - as a big company you might need a cdn to
01:54 - do something specifically for you you
01:56 - might want your site to be on the fast
01:59 - track to your users and you might need a
02:00 - cdn to do that
02:03 - all i want you to take away from this
02:04 - video is that cdns are content delivery
02:08 - networks they are all over the place and
02:11 - they make a faster user experience
