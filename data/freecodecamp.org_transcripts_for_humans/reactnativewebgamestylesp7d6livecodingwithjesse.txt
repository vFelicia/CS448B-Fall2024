00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:09 - going to do some styling on our react
00:12 - native web
00:14 - app
00:16 - so
00:18 - just as a quick intro
00:20 - this show is just about me uh coding
00:24 - live it's not rehearsed so i will make
00:26 - mistakes
00:28 - uh it's it's not exactly a tutorial so
00:31 - there definitely may be better ways to
00:32 - do what i'm trying to do
00:34 - um
00:36 - i set a pomodoro timer and we code for
00:39 - 25 minutes and then i take a little
00:41 - break and answer some questions in the
00:43 - live chat
00:45 - and we'll do that probably twice
00:47 - and
00:49 - i'll be live live coding and answering
00:51 - questions for about an hour today
00:54 - feel free to ask questions about
00:55 - anything you want
00:56 - i'll do my best to answer all the
00:58 - questions
01:00 - and
01:01 - i definitely encourage contributions so
01:03 - if you have ideas
01:05 - for the project
01:08 - you know go ahead and
01:10 - put those in the live chat as well
01:14 - so if you check the description to this
01:16 - video you can find a link to the
01:19 - github repo where you can see all the
01:21 - code
01:22 - that i'm using here
01:24 - so far uh everything is pretty much in
01:28 - app.js we haven't broken anything else
01:30 - out into separate components yet
01:32 - although we we probably will soon
01:36 - and
01:38 - let's see oops we gotta start it
01:44 - okay so we built this out using create
01:46 - react app uh but we're also using react
01:49 - native web
01:50 - and that means we're gonna be using
01:52 - react native syntax
01:54 - but it is rendering to the dom
01:57 - instead of
01:58 - uh android or or ios
02:03 - all right let's start up the timer
02:08 - okay
02:10 - uh this is the the github repo
02:13 - and i guess i'll throw this link in the
02:16 - chat as well
02:20 - just in case
02:25 - so i have a few of you saying hi
02:28 - so hey how's it going
02:31 - all right so here's what we have so far
02:33 - it doesn't look great
02:37 - so
02:38 - let me tell you what i'm thinking in
02:40 - terms of styling and then
02:43 - i'll get some feedback and we'll go from
02:45 - there
02:47 - so
02:52 - right off the bat i say
02:54 - since the target audience is children
02:58 - i'll probably approach the styling to
03:00 - this a little bit different than i
03:01 - normally would for for an app we want to
03:04 - keep the inputs and the fonts larger
03:07 - than normal
03:09 - um
03:13 - let's see
03:15 - probably keep the colors like pretty
03:17 - bright
03:21 - okay and other than that just like
03:23 - anything like play any playful elements
03:25 - we could add will probably be be good as
03:27 - well
03:32 - so
03:34 - let's let's think about these uh
03:36 - characters so right now this is supposed
03:38 - to be like the hero character and these
03:40 - are the enemies
03:43 - so
03:44 - i'm thinking
03:48 - maybe we could um
03:50 - use some css to style these
03:57 - i don't know i go back and forth so like
03:59 - my ideas are either like we could try to
04:01 - find like some
04:03 - like sprites to use
04:05 - right like video game sprites right uh
04:07 - and have
04:08 - like characters that look like real
04:10 - characters or
04:13 - we could keep it
04:15 - i don't know more of just like normal
04:18 - divs and just do some styling on it uh
04:21 - to make them look different so i there's
04:23 - some pretty cool stuff you can do with
04:25 - just css
04:26 - uh i'll let y'all think about that for a
04:28 - minute and let me know in the chat what
04:30 - you think like should we try to find
04:33 - you know images to use
04:35 - uh for our for our characters or
04:38 - uh should we see if we can do some some
04:40 - css stuff
04:43 - uh so i'm i genuinely am just not sure
04:46 - at this point what i'd what i'd rather
04:48 - do
04:49 - uh
04:50 - you know i imagine
04:52 - the css stuff has the advantage of the
04:55 - the overall game being
04:57 - smaller in terms of file size
05:00 - but i don't know that it'll be
05:01 - that big of a difference
05:05 - also some some other ideas i had for
05:07 - styling is that depending on the game
05:10 - mode
05:11 - uh the colors could change right uh
05:13 - potentially like the enemies could
05:15 - change right so the addition enemies
05:17 - would be different than the subtraction
05:19 - enemies right uh different colors at
05:21 - least
05:24 - um
05:26 - maybe
05:28 - maybe different background
05:29 - right i'm not
05:31 - right now it's very bright it's very
05:33 - bright and white so we could definitely
05:34 - go with a different background
05:40 - okay
05:41 - all right i'm gonna go to the chat
05:42 - really quick and just see what you all
05:43 - think about
05:45 - um
05:49 - about whether to go with images or just
05:52 - some some cool css stuff
05:54 - um
05:55 - jake knife says
05:57 - definitely use images
05:59 - vincent says yes you sprites sergey says
06:02 - svg actually yeah if we could find some
06:04 - svgs that that would be really cool
06:07 - um
06:13 - muhammad says css can be better you have
06:15 - more control over it
06:16 - that's true if if we could find svgs
06:21 - some like svg images we could maybe have
06:24 - the best of both worlds where we could
06:25 - still use css to manipulate the images
06:28 - and have control
06:30 - like potentially we could change colors
06:33 - um programmatically
06:37 - um sprites
06:40 - okay
06:48 - vincent says so why not use sprites
06:51 - yeah i'm i'm open i'm open to that okay
06:55 - so my next question would be does
06:57 - anybody know where a good place to get
06:59 - sprites are like right now i'd probably
07:02 - be looking for some free stuff but i'm
07:03 - i'm not
07:05 - opposed to like paying for for good
07:08 - stuff i mean
07:10 - um
07:12 - you know maybe
07:14 - some cool backgrounds too might not be a
07:16 - bad idea
07:17 - uh so
07:20 - i just don't know where the best place
07:21 - to get that is so if anybody has any
07:23 - ideas uh put them in the chat if you
07:25 - want to paste a link it probably won't
07:27 - show up but i'll still be able to see it
07:29 - uh just no one else will be able to see
07:31 - it
07:34 - um
07:35 - so i'm not going to take time to like go
07:37 - search for sprites right now because
07:40 - it'll probably be boring to just watch
07:41 - me do google searches
07:43 - so let's try to work on
07:45 - some of the
07:47 - other styles for now
07:50 - so i imagine
07:54 - let's see in web app mode
07:58 - positioning is not a huge deal
08:02 - but on different screen sizes we're
08:05 - probably going to run into some issues
08:08 - so we do need to consider that
08:16 - might want to maybe
08:17 - just like decrease the size of
08:21 - these at some point but
08:24 - probably wait until we figure out
08:25 - whether we're using sprites or not to
08:27 - actually do that
08:29 - um so let's check it
08:34 - all right let's look at maybe some
08:39 - some color schemes
08:46 - and we need to make
08:48 - if i want things to change we probably
08:50 - need to set up a theme
08:51 - so let's go ahead and do that now and
08:53 - just set up a like a css theme that can
08:57 - be easily changed based on state
09:04 - okay so currently since the entire app
09:07 - is just
09:08 - in this one app.js file this is going to
09:10 - be pretty easy um to set up
09:15 - a theme
09:16 - uh eventually we will have to probably
09:18 - pass down some things but i think it
09:19 - should still be okay
09:25 - sorry i'm yawning again
09:27 - i think i'm actually getting sick i had
09:29 - my throat really hurt so
09:31 - i might be a little bit
09:34 - more tired and slow
09:36 - uh today
09:38 - so do we have css yet i can't remember
09:41 - if we did it yeah we do okay cool
09:45 - um
09:48 - so we do have oh yeah we have some
09:51 - styles in here we have some colors
09:55 - um
09:57 - what i want to do
10:02 - based on our state is is switch that out
10:06 - so
10:07 - uh what kind of themes we're gonna need
10:13 - hmm
10:21 - maybe we should just base the themes off
10:23 - of like the edition theme the
10:25 - subtraction theme
10:27 - that i think that kind of makes
10:30 - that makes sense right
10:32 - so if we're going to do it like that
10:34 - then we could just use mode so we don't
10:37 - really need a different
10:39 - uh
10:39 - thing in state right
10:42 - so for now
10:44 - let's just set some
10:48 - background colors on
10:50 - the main container div and then it'll be
10:52 - really obvious just to test things out
10:54 - it's probably not going to look really
10:56 - good right now
10:57 - uh but it'll be a good um it'll be a
11:00 - good test
11:03 - okay so
11:07 - for our styles
11:11 - let's say we're gonna have
11:14 - styles equal so we'll have styles equals
11:18 - or
11:19 - styles.root but we're going to do
11:22 - two
11:23 - styles so when we want to add more than
11:25 - one style
11:28 - we're gonna just make a
11:30 - an array inside this this object
11:33 - right
11:34 - and then we can just separate everything
11:37 - with commas just like a normal array so
11:39 - we could also
11:40 - do styles and then i'm gonna do
11:45 - um
11:46 - instead of the normal dot syntax right
11:49 - i'm gonna do
11:53 - let's see i'm gonna do this
11:55 - style start all right
11:57 - i'm gonna put a variable in here so
11:59 - right so i don't want to put dots so i'm
12:00 - gonna put this
12:02 - state
12:04 - um
12:05 - mode
12:06 - and actually while we're at it uh let's
12:09 - let's do some um destructuring
12:12 - so we don't have to use this state
12:14 - everywhere right
12:16 - uh so if you're not familiar with
12:17 - destructuring here's what we're gonna do
12:19 - so we're gonna say const
12:25 - and we're gonna put in some of the
12:27 - elements of states we're gonna do mode
12:30 - let's see what else we have here
12:34 - let's just put
12:35 - all our state
12:37 - um
12:38 - i'm just going to copy this for now and
12:40 - paste it down here just so that i can
12:42 - see it
12:44 - and then we'll just get rid of it
12:46 - so
12:47 - let's do mode answer
12:52 - uh
12:53 - number of enemies
12:58 - one
12:59 - val2
13:02 - uh one
13:05 - and operator
13:07 - okay
13:11 - if this doesn't make sense right now
13:12 - we'll it will in a second and then we're
13:14 - going to say equals this dot state
13:18 - okay so now that we have all of these
13:23 - here
13:24 - every place where we say this dot state
13:27 - down below
13:30 - we can get rid of
13:32 - so
13:34 - it's it's going to clean things up a
13:35 - little bit
13:36 - all right
13:37 - so i'm just going to use the uh multiple
13:40 - cursors here
13:45 - there we go
13:46 - and get rid of them all
13:48 - yeah so now we don't have to keep typing
13:50 - the state uh and it definitely cleans
13:53 - things up a bit
13:54 - selected value
13:56 - language
13:59 - uh oh
14:00 - what did i do did i forget
14:09 - hmm
14:20 - was that really this state
14:30 - uh you know what this was probably left
14:31 - over from the example i copied and
14:34 - pasted and i just never
14:36 - never did anything so uh selected value
14:39 - for this um picker is always gonna equal
14:43 - the mode
14:45 - okay
14:47 - all right
14:48 - so let's save it and just go go over
14:50 - just to show that you know everything
14:52 - still works so
14:54 - subtraction multiplication
14:56 - division also looks like uh our our
15:01 - selector here our picker is not wide
15:03 - enough so we need to change the the
15:06 - width of that
15:08 - okay but other than that everything's
15:10 - still still working um
15:13 - see
15:14 - there we go
15:15 - uh
15:16 - yeah still working
15:19 - okay now
15:21 - what will happen is uh we can have
15:23 - styles for each mode and we'll put that
15:26 - down here
15:28 - right so
15:30 - we can have
15:32 - addition
15:38 - and let's just say um
15:43 - background color
15:45 - and we're gonna make them just super
15:47 - uh obvious
15:50 - for now
15:53 - background color green
15:57 - and we'll just copy this for each one
16:04 - and change it up
16:06 - subtraction
16:12 - subtraction
16:16 - uh
16:22 - multiplication and
16:25 - division
16:32 - and pink
16:35 - yellow
16:37 - and
16:39 - orange
16:41 - i'm trying to pick different colors than
16:43 - we already have on the screen for other
16:45 - things
16:48 - okay let's see if that worked
16:56 - oh actually
16:57 - multiplication doesn't work yellow
17:00 - let me uh
17:07 - don't tell me i misspelled this
17:11 - uh let me go
17:12 - case multiplication
17:15 - i'm gonna copy and paste this so that
17:22 - i don't even have to worry about
17:24 - spelling
17:32 - all right let's try multiplication there
17:34 - we go it must have been a misspelling
17:36 - and division
17:39 - that orange does not really look orange
17:41 - that's kind of weird maybe it's just my
17:43 - screen maybe it looks different for you
17:45 - actually i think it's my screen because
17:46 - on my other screen
17:48 - um i can see it and it looks way more
17:51 - orange on my other screen
17:53 - uh
17:55 - all right
17:58 - okay so that this is not like the
18:00 - prettiest thing in the world right now
18:03 - um
18:04 - but at least we can see like how it how
18:07 - it could work here
18:08 - um
18:11 - okay
18:12 - now i did think while i was doing that i
18:15 - thought
18:15 - actually
18:17 - this may not be the best way to do it
18:18 - because i can pretty much only change
18:20 - the background here right
18:24 - um
18:27 - so what i could do
18:32 - i could actually make separate um style
18:35 - sheets
18:36 - right so instead of
18:38 - uh
18:39 - just having caught styles
18:41 - we could have
18:45 - like we could have our regular cons
18:48 - styles right
18:49 - and then i could also have
18:53 - a const for addition styles subtraction
18:55 - styles right and then up here so i'm
18:58 - trying to find where we have this up
19:00 - here instead of styles dot root
19:03 - styles dot mode it would be like styles
19:05 - dot root but then we could have
19:07 - addition styles or whatever
19:11 - um
19:12 - dot root
19:13 - and
19:15 - this would be the thing what would
19:16 - change is the name
19:18 - the basically the mode right
19:20 - so
19:22 - i think that's a better way to go
19:24 - because then
19:25 - we could have uh styles for
19:29 - a lot of other stuff right um
19:32 - for our our heroes and our enemies right
19:39 - so i think that's a better way to go
19:41 - let me check my time see if you have
19:42 - enough time to get to do that yeah we
19:44 - have about seven minutes so
19:46 - um
19:49 - let's see
19:55 - it's just checking the um
19:58 - chat really quick to see
20:00 - uh if i'd done anything really crazy
20:06 - okay
20:07 - so let's do that let's let me first just
20:10 - copy
20:11 - everything here
20:14 - we're not going to change every single
20:16 - style here but
20:17 - for now
20:20 - actually before i copy everything four
20:23 - times
20:24 - um
20:27 - let me copy it
20:30 - one time
20:32 - then make the adjustments and then copy
20:34 - that one
20:36 - so we don't have to keep making
20:37 - adjustments so
20:39 - our input
20:40 - is unlikely to change so let's take that
20:43 - out for now
20:44 - our text
20:46 - size is unlikely to change
20:51 - same way with this is just a row
20:54 - container
20:56 - um
20:57 - we're going to keep our hero and enemy
20:58 - in there because
21:01 - those will probably change
21:04 - our container will be the same
21:08 - our battlefield
21:11 - i'm going to take that out for now but
21:13 - you know we may want to actually have
21:15 - some sort of like
21:17 - more intricate battlefield background
21:19 - right
21:22 - and then for this
21:24 - we're no longer going to need addition
21:25 - subtraction multiplication down here
21:27 - what we'll have then is just
21:33 - a
21:34 - background color
21:36 - all right on root
21:39 - and then here we would say
21:44 - edition
21:48 - right
21:52 - all right so we'll just take that out
21:56 - and now
21:58 - i'll just copy this one
22:06 - and
22:07 - let's change this to subtraction
22:16 - and
22:17 - [Music]
22:18 - give this the
22:22 - background color
22:29 - okay
22:45 - and this is going to be multiplication
22:47 - which i'm definitely going to copy and
22:48 - paste since evidently i can't spell that
22:50 - consistently
22:53 - and we're going to give it that
22:55 - uh
22:56 - yellow background which
22:59 - these are likely going to change at some
23:01 - point but
23:02 - um it'll give us a nice visual
23:04 - indicator at least for now
23:09 - and one more
23:11 - and that's division
23:27 - division and
23:28 - [Music]
23:33 - orange
23:40 - and then
23:59 - okay i think it's probably complaining
24:01 - that we haven't actually used these
24:18 - styles is defined
24:21 - objection
24:25 - actually that's really weird
24:27 - did i copy styles again
24:30 - i copied too many times yeah i did
24:34 - okay let me get rid of that one
24:44 - okay
24:44 - so let's see if this will work i know um
24:47 - my my linter is not going to like that
24:50 - i'm not using those
24:53 - but
24:54 - let's see if this works
24:56 - um
24:58 - so we're going to switch this up so
25:00 - it'll say
25:03 - um
25:07 - actually can i even do this
25:12 - i don't know if anybody caught that this
25:13 - might not work
25:20 - um
25:22 - rabbitworks asks why am i copying so
25:23 - much code just to change the background
25:25 - color well because we're we're going to
25:26 - change more than the background color
25:29 - so i just copied it to save us some
25:30 - typing later
25:33 - but essentially like all those elements
25:35 - i copied will change all of them
25:38 - but now that i did this now i'm not sure
25:40 - it'll work because
25:53 - it's gonna be
25:55 - mode
26:00 - yeah
26:01 - this is not gonna work
26:02 - all right i'll just try it but i'm
26:03 - pretty sure this isn't gonna work
26:11 - yep it's not going to work
26:15 - oops well i have a syntax error too so
26:17 - it's definitely not going to work
26:25 - all right yeah
26:29 - all right how can i do this
26:33 - all right so if you don't realize what i
26:35 - just did that that was uh i really wish
26:38 - i would have thought of before i just
26:40 - did all this other stuff
26:42 - um
26:45 - i i switched around so that basically
26:48 - the variable part
26:50 - would be here but that's that does not
26:52 - work
26:53 - you can't do that
26:55 - so
27:00 - i was trying to make it
27:04 - so that it would work
27:08 - for multiple things all right let me uh
27:10 - timer's up so let me set this let me go
27:12 - to the um
27:14 - to the chat here
27:15 - and we'll have to rethink i guess how we
27:18 - want to do this theme
27:23 - um
27:25 - let's see
27:26 - i just saw michael creole says can you
27:28 - do a switch yeah i'm wondering if um
27:34 - i'm wondering if we may end up doing
27:37 - some sort of switch
27:43 - all right let me scroll up so i can
27:45 - catch as many questions as i can during
27:47 - this this five minute time period here
27:54 - um
27:55 - let's see aag says which language you
27:59 - use uh javascript mostly
28:03 - it looks like some some other people
28:05 - have the same question so
28:13 - rjs how are you i'm i'm doing all right
28:16 - i think i'm getting sick but it's i
28:18 - don't think it's serious i think it'll
28:19 - just be like a cold or something like
28:21 - that
28:23 - um willie says hi there for coding being
28:26 - this advanced is it too late for me to
28:28 - start
28:28 - oh no no it's definitely not too late uh
28:31 - for you to start
28:34 - i'm not sure if you mean like to start
28:36 - following this stream in which case i'd
28:38 - say no it's not too late or like just to
28:40 - start learning to code
28:42 - like in general either way it's not too
28:45 - late
28:50 - john paul says think crazy ideas
28:53 - cool
28:54 - i'll try
28:57 - um
28:58 - we have a question i'm not sure how to
29:00 - pronounce your name so sorry but uh the
29:02 - question is will web dev die out
29:05 - uh i don't think it'll die out uh it it
29:09 - honestly seems like
29:12 - people are doing more things on the web
29:15 - than they ever have done right there are
29:17 - more complicated applications now for
29:20 - the web than at any point so
29:22 - uh and and think about the companies
29:24 - that are the biggest companies in the
29:26 - world are
29:27 - companies who do things on the web right
29:31 - uh facebook uh google amazon
29:35 - uh
29:35 - those are all web-based companies and
29:37 - their their revenue comes through
29:40 - the web
29:41 - so i do not think web dev will die out
29:43 - anytime soon
29:45 - um in fact i don't know if you all saw
29:47 - the announcement from google about
29:48 - stadia but google's has this
29:51 - big gaming thing now that's basically
29:53 - running through a web browser
29:55 - so i know that's like not exactly web
29:58 - dev but
29:59 - you know that
30:01 - the platform is the web
30:14 - uh willie says i was thinking about
30:15 - starting with html5 css javascript java
30:19 - and then some app coding and maybe games
30:21 - um willie yeah definitely start out with
30:24 - your html css javascript
30:26 - um
30:28 - and then you'll be able to do a ton of
30:29 - stuff with just that
30:31 - and you'll probably have a good idea
30:33 - about like what what you want to do
30:36 - you know after that
30:44 - uh let's see
30:47 - muhammad asks what am i doing here oh um
30:49 - i'm building a math game for kids
30:53 - so just something really simple right
30:55 - now we're just into like single digit
30:56 - math
31:10 - uh francis says this is quite impressive
31:12 - but i'm still a beginner will i catch up
31:14 - along the way
31:15 - yeah yeah you can catch up and and if
31:17 - you always if you want to you can check
31:19 - out the
31:20 - the previous recordings
31:26 - uh rabbitworks says
31:28 - um
31:30 - for the styling that we were just doing
31:32 - um put it in an array
31:34 - um
31:36 - and object for the color
31:43 - let's see
31:51 - um
31:59 - jason lima says what is there other than
32:01 - the web i think this is in regard to the
32:04 - you know will web dev die out says what
32:06 - is there other than web mobile desktop
32:09 - yeah i would say like
32:11 - that's it mobile and desktop
32:15 - you could say like in terms of
32:17 - programming like console gaming
32:20 - that's programming internet of things
32:24 - so i mean it's
32:26 - you could break it down but so many
32:28 - things are tied into the web now
32:30 - it's the lines between different types
32:32 - of development i i think are are getting
32:35 - really blurred because it seems like
32:37 - everything
32:38 - at some point ties into the web
32:44 - so maybe like traditional web dev of
32:47 - like hey i know html and css i can do
32:49 - web development
32:51 - that that is probably
32:53 - already dying or dead right
32:56 - most
32:57 - successful websites or web apps need
33:00 - more than that
33:03 - but web dev is now
33:06 - it's become more than it was it
33:08 - we have more capabilities on the web
33:10 - than we've had before so
33:12 - web dev is not going to die it's just it
33:14 - just adapts and takes on more
33:17 - capabilities
33:24 - all right um let me
33:28 - let me take a note of where we are
33:32 - in the chat
33:35 - and so i can go back to it
33:44 - and
33:45 - i'm gonna
33:46 - restart my pomodoro timer
33:52 - and
33:53 - let's try to do more okay so where we
33:56 - ended with our coding was i just broke
33:58 - it
34:01 - so what i did
34:09 - let me talk through what i did and what
34:10 - i was trying to do and let's see if we
34:12 - can figure out an answer here so what i
34:14 - would like to do
34:16 - is have completely different themes
34:22 - depending on
34:25 - the state so we're going to go off of
34:28 - this mode
34:30 - okay so the mode will switch between
34:32 - addition subtraction multiplication and
34:35 - division
34:37 - and then based on that
34:38 - i've created different themes down here
34:41 - or at least started to
34:43 - for each one of those for the addition
34:45 - subtraction multiplication division
34:48 - right
34:50 - and these are style sheets so these are
34:52 - essentially javascript objects
34:56 - so what i need to do then
34:59 - is switch them out
35:01 - however
35:03 - what i had hoped i could do and then
35:05 - realized i couldn't do was basically
35:08 - make this first part here so we're using
35:11 - you know javascript object
35:14 - and here it works because i can say
35:16 - styles.root so styles is an object
35:19 - but here what i'm trying to do is use
35:22 - the value of mode as the object so so
35:25 - mode itself
35:27 - is a string
35:31 - but what i wanted to refer to is the
35:33 - name of
35:36 - huh i wonder
35:53 - all right so what i need is some way
35:58 - and we can totally rethink everything
36:00 - but like
36:01 - at this point
36:03 - i need some way
36:05 - to designate
36:10 - um which style sheet i want to use here
36:15 - so we're going to keep styles always
36:17 - that'll be like our base styles
36:20 - and then we'll cut down these
36:22 - um themes to be
36:24 - as like small as possible and only
36:27 - change what
36:28 - uh what needs to be changed
36:32 - but i need some way to put that in there
36:35 - so
36:36 - let me
36:38 - see uh michael creo says uh put it in
36:42 - the existing switch
36:46 - uh or object literal
36:53 - okay
37:01 - yeah all right let's take a look at that
37:02 - switch statement and see what we could
37:04 - do there
37:08 - all right so right now
37:10 - we are
37:19 - hmm
37:48 - you know what
37:49 - how did i do this i did a theme
37:52 - so i could toggle a theme on
37:54 - a project recently
37:58 - let me open it on my other computer
37:59 - really quick
38:02 - it's i already have it open on my other
38:04 - computer so let me just check it
38:15 - so let's see i in my other project i
38:18 - used like a theme.js file
38:25 - oh okay
38:27 - i see what i did
38:38 - okay this is uh
38:40 - this might work
38:42 - um
38:45 - all right let me run this by you and see
38:46 - what if
38:50 - we take these themes and instead of
38:53 - using um like
38:55 - stylesheet.create here
38:57 - which normally i would definitely
38:58 - recommend we just make them like
39:00 - straight objects right
39:02 - um
39:04 - and then we say like
39:09 - basically we just put the values in here
39:10 - so let me do it with
39:12 - um addition first
39:14 - just to show you what i mean
39:16 - and uh see if if that
39:19 - could work so
39:24 - actually think will that work
39:29 - do this
39:38 - all right yeah let me each all right so
39:40 - let's let's do this
39:41 - what if we did
39:45 - themes so we'll have this this themes
39:47 - object right within the themes object
39:50 - we'll have one called
39:52 - edition
39:57 - um
40:00 - and then within addition we could say
40:02 - like
40:07 - background color
40:09 - um and we could
40:11 - again we'll call it green
40:14 - okay
40:15 - and let's just we'll make two just so we
40:17 - could switch and we'll make one called
40:19 - um subtraction
40:22 - i believe subtraction was pink
40:24 - okay so we have addition and subtraction
40:29 - um
40:35 - and then
40:42 - [Music]
40:47 - and then we can have uh let's say
40:50 - active theme
40:55 - is going to be
40:57 - is going to equal
41:02 - let's actually let's switch that up
41:09 - oops and i messed this up
41:12 - already
41:13 - background
41:14 - background
41:18 - color there we go
41:21 - i knew that did not look right okay so
41:23 - we have that here now
41:25 - in
41:28 - here we'll make a
41:32 - let's say
41:36 - we'll say active theme
41:38 - is going to equal
41:40 - theme
41:42 - and that's where we'll put mode
41:46 - right
41:49 - that says seam is not defined
41:52 - what
41:53 - theme is defined didn't i define it down
41:55 - here
41:57 - oh themes
42:02 - okay
42:03 - so our active theme is themes.mode now
42:06 - in here
42:09 - we can say
42:12 - background
42:18 - background color
42:20 - equals
42:22 - um
42:25 - let's see active theme dot
42:33 - let's see
42:34 - background
42:36 - background color right
42:39 - i think that'll work
42:45 - okay
42:51 - all right let's see if that works
42:55 - if it works then i'll explain more about
42:57 - why it works
42:58 - okay let's try subtraction now yay and
43:00 - these ones won't work right because we
43:02 - don't have anything for them yet
43:07 - okay
43:10 - all right so
43:12 - this works so basically what we've what
43:14 - we've done then is
43:18 - um
43:20 - active theme is equal to
43:23 - whatever
43:25 - theme
43:27 - name
43:29 - is equal to the mode right
43:31 - which is addition subtraction
43:33 - multiplication division
43:35 - right so then
43:37 - we can just use active theme in here so
43:39 - we don't we don't ever have to worry
43:41 - about well what's the mode down here
43:42 - because we've already set
43:44 - what the active theme is so then down
43:46 - here
43:47 - we could add as many different things as
43:49 - we want
43:52 - like as many different
43:53 - attributes
43:55 - oops not there here
43:59 - right and
44:01 - and we will we'll add
44:03 - i'm sure we'll add different colors for
44:05 - various things
44:08 - but then that way that gives us a really
44:09 - easy way to switch themes
44:12 - so and now
44:14 - uh we can actually get rid of
44:16 - a lot of
44:18 - a lot of what we've done let me get rid
44:19 - of them up here too because we had
44:22 - um
44:25 - actually if i just copy these this
44:26 - should work
44:28 - yeah
44:30 - so let's copy that
44:31 - and
44:35 - multiplication
44:36 - nice
44:38 - all right so that'll work
44:40 - let's do a little bit of cleanup here
44:54 - okay
44:56 - cool so now we have our all our base
44:58 - styles here
45:00 - and then we can override any of those
45:03 - from here
45:06 - and we'll just verify that that works
45:09 - so
45:10 - [Music]
45:11 - everything should work awesome
45:15 - cool so now we have colors
45:18 - maybe not the the prettiest of colors
45:22 - but for a target audience for kids
45:26 - this this might actually be fun
45:29 - right
45:30 - i don't really know maybe i'll have to
45:32 - look at some color theory for children
45:34 - if i before like we really decide on
45:37 - what the colors should be
45:38 - um but for now this this is okay
45:41 - um
45:44 - probably the only other thing that i'd
45:45 - want to do right now is change the
45:47 - colors of uh like the enemies maybe
45:52 - um
45:53 - in terms of usability i i guess like the
45:56 - most pressing thing would just be this
45:58 - needs to be wider so let's make that
46:00 - wider so that the entire thing is
46:03 - visible
46:04 - um
46:07 - i don't know what it is right now
46:12 - let's see
46:16 - so that's our our picker and i don't
46:18 - think we have
46:20 - any styles for that yet
46:23 - um oh okay so we do we have a width set
46:26 - to
46:29 - 100 uh let's see if like 150 would work
46:33 - i think 150 will work
46:36 - see how that looks
46:41 - yeah for sure that works it looks a
46:43 - little awkward
46:44 - but
46:48 - at least that fits for all of them
46:50 - uh also it looks like a little bit tall
46:53 - i mean i want the inputs to be nice and
46:55 - big so that it's easy for kids to
46:58 - use like a touch screen but i think we
47:00 - can maybe go
47:02 - with like 40 for the height
47:05 - and see how that looks
47:07 - oops didn't mean to hit that key
47:13 - okay
47:14 - all right there we go 40 looks better
47:21 - all right that's good and i do have this
47:24 - text this battle math text
47:26 - let's give this a style
47:30 - uh
47:32 - style
47:32 - [Music]
47:35 - equals
47:42 - sorry about my typing uh
47:45 - i just i only use this keyboard
47:48 - pretty much when i do these streams
47:50 - twice a week and sometimes not even then
47:52 - so
47:53 - um it's totally different from like the
47:55 - normal macbook ebook that i use
47:57 - keyboard that i use so it definitely
47:59 - messes up my typing
48:02 - let's just call this title
48:05 - so we'll have styles.title
48:07 - um we want our title to be bigger so
48:11 - we're going to put this just in our our
48:12 - normal styles
48:15 - uh so we want font size
48:19 - to be
48:21 - um
48:24 - let's try 24 pixels and see how that
48:26 - looks and then
48:29 - we'll have to figure out like what kind
48:30 - of font family we want to
48:39 - font family
48:43 - let's go comic sans
48:45 - i wonder if that's like if that's will
48:47 - work by default nope
48:51 - failing to compile what did i do oops i
48:53 - didn't put a comma
48:58 - let's just have fun we'll put comic sans
48:59 - in there i know comic sans usually awful
49:01 - oh no it won't work
49:09 - uh
49:10 - yeah maybe i'll have to look up what it
49:12 - is um
49:14 - let's see
49:23 - uh there we go web safe fonts
49:32 - okay comic sans
49:34 - ms
49:38 - okay
49:39 - so let's try that
49:41 - actually that's why we're here let's
49:42 - just see if there's another one that i
49:43 - like better
49:48 - let's go with this i just want something
49:49 - that looks like
49:51 - you know kid kid friendly right
49:54 - i don't really want to go with comic
49:55 - sans
49:56 - like um
49:59 - as my final solution here
50:03 - oops
50:11 - all right i'm just gonna use uh back
50:13 - ticks
50:16 - that way this won't matter i could have
50:18 - used single quotes too but um
50:21 - my hand just hit the back tick first
50:23 - there we go
50:24 - okay so here's our our comic sans
50:27 - um i definitely want a little bit more
50:30 - padding between uh the top of this and
50:33 - the bottom of that
50:36 - i don't know just
50:38 - let's see
50:43 - i don't know that still looks really
50:45 - like
50:46 - large what is my am i zooming in on this
50:49 - i am
50:53 - wow
50:57 - okay for some reason i was super zoomed
51:00 - in on this so now
51:01 - this makes a lot more sense as to why
51:03 - everything looked huge
51:06 - so let me let me check my zoom level all
51:08 - right so this is the real level
51:11 - of zoom
51:13 - all right i think we have some work to
51:15 - do
51:19 - uh because
51:21 - now this is a totally different story
51:24 - all right so we got seven minutes let's
51:26 - try to increase a lot of of what we've
51:29 - been doing here
51:31 - okay
51:34 - i would like to take this
51:41 - these styles for the picker and move
51:43 - them down
51:45 - okay so
51:47 - um
51:48 - let's copy these
51:51 - and we'll actually cut them and we'll go
51:57 - we'll say styles.picker
52:10 - okay and i'm gonna uh switch this so
52:13 - that it's
52:15 - actually
52:16 - oops let's make it 60
52:22 - and
52:25 - let's make
52:27 - the title
52:30 - 32
52:34 - and
52:36 - let's make these
52:44 - um
52:49 - actually let's let's do this let's make
52:52 - let's make a character
52:55 - um
52:57 - style
52:58 - and that's where we'll put our
53:00 - width and height
53:05 - so that way we don't have to change them
53:07 - both all the time
53:11 - and i'm going to switch them up and
53:13 - let's give them a double
53:16 - the width and the height that they have
53:17 - right now
53:20 - see how that looks
53:22 - um and then the math text
53:26 - hmm all right let's let's try that out
53:29 - with uh 26. maybe let's bump that up to
53:32 - 28 for now
53:34 - i know it's not a lot but
53:36 - we'll see how it looks uh we also need
53:38 - to
53:40 - add um
53:43 - on our
53:44 - hero
53:45 - and enemies
53:49 - where
53:50 - are we at with those
53:54 - there we are styles.hero so we'll add
53:57 - here is styles
53:59 - dot
54:01 - character
54:08 - and we'll do the same thing
54:13 - for our
54:15 - enemies
54:20 - okay
54:22 - all right
54:24 - now let's let's see what that looks like
54:28 - okay not bad i made made things a little
54:31 - bit bigger
54:41 - hmm
54:54 - that's weird
54:56 - it's not
54:57 - it's not letting me change this there we
54:59 - go
55:09 - now that we have all the space
55:16 - hmm
55:20 - interesting okay
55:24 - we have about three minutes left
55:27 - before we go to the questions um if
55:30 - anybody has any suggestions
55:32 - now that i finally realized that i had
55:35 - this zoomed in a lot
55:37 - um
55:39 - let me know
55:42 - i'm thinking i could definitely do with
55:44 - some more padding like top and bottom
55:47 - padding
55:51 - let's see
55:55 - so we could do
55:56 - padding
55:58 - vertical
56:00 - and say something like um
56:04 - just do like 16 uh pixels for now 16
56:08 - units
56:09 - uh react native is basically unitless
56:11 - okay
56:13 - it just felt a little tight
56:16 - up here and down here
56:24 - and we do have like
56:26 - so we're using flexbox
56:30 - so like right now this container is
56:31 - supposed to take up all the space
56:34 - that's left
56:36 - left over after this container and this
56:38 - container does do their things
56:41 - so
56:42 - what i could do is
56:46 - maybe make this container bigger
56:50 - do i not have this in an actual
56:52 - container
56:53 - interesting
56:57 - okay
56:58 - um
57:00 - yeah
57:02 - so let's say it would come up to like
57:04 - here and i can have this stuff come up
57:07 - here
57:07 - it just seems too far down right now
57:10 - you know
57:14 - i would kind of like to have better
57:16 - looking
57:17 - the picker's okay
57:19 - i maybe would like to have better
57:20 - looking input so i do want to look into
57:22 - that as well to see like um
57:25 - maybe there's
57:28 - better styled inputs that we could bring
57:30 - in
57:36 - all right what do you think let me know
57:39 - um
57:44 - berto says
57:45 - just think if this was for atari you
57:47 - would be almost completely done
57:51 - actually that would be kind of cool what
57:52 - if
57:54 - what if we made a um
57:57 - like a react native
58:00 - uh plug-in that lets you
58:03 - have atari as a target like you could
58:05 - design it in with react native but it it
58:08 - compiled down to be able to play on an
58:10 - atari
58:12 - that would actu that would be really
58:13 - cool i have no idea what it would take
58:15 - but there's a guy i work with that um
58:19 - that
58:20 - used to write programs for the atari i
58:22 - don't know if he still does but
58:24 - he would know what it would take
58:26 - to do that
58:29 - all right so let me
58:31 - i don't really have enough time left on
58:32 - my pomodoro timer to do anything so
58:34 - let's just go right to the questions
58:36 - here i'm going to scroll up to where we
58:38 - left off
58:40 - um
58:42 - actually let me um
58:44 - let me commit this stuff
58:49 - oops
58:52 - okay let's do it get commit
58:56 - a.m so we're gonna oops
59:00 - we're gonna add and commit at the same
59:02 - time
59:04 - let's say we're adding a new feature
59:06 - and we'll say we
59:08 - add
59:11 - themes
59:17 - for each
59:20 - mode
59:21 - okay
59:22 - so we didn't add full themes but i mean
59:23 - that's basically what we did so let's
59:25 - commit that and push it
59:31 - okay since it's just me working on this
59:33 - right now and it's a small like side
59:35 - project i'm committing straight to
59:36 - master normally if you're working on
59:38 - like open source or a project with a
59:40 - team
59:41 - you would want to do every change on a
59:43 - separate branch and then submit a pull
59:45 - request
59:47 - but for your own projects i mean it's
59:49 - fine to do it like this
59:51 - once you actually launch you probably
59:53 - don't want to have like your master
59:54 - branch the one you work on all the time
59:56 - you want to work on maybe a dev branch
60:02 - all right
60:04 - um
60:05 - lubomir uh says hey why did you choose
60:08 - react over ujs in one sentence
60:11 - one sentence
60:12 - i know react but i don't know view
60:16 - okay if you want a better explanation
60:18 - than that let me know
60:23 - let's see
60:25 - a monster challenge
60:27 - [Music]
60:30 - all right pub g skilled
60:33 - okay i think i think there's a
60:35 - conversation going on between people in
60:36 - the chat so i'm gonna skip through some
60:38 - of those
60:39 - um
60:43 - lucas says view or react
60:45 - um i've heard good things about vue but
60:47 - i've never used it
60:49 - i work with react all the time
60:51 - so that's definitely my my go-to if i
60:54 - need to build something
60:55 - but i have nothing against you
61:06 - okay
61:16 - let's see
61:42 - all right
61:44 - okay uh there's a question about where
61:46 - did this program
61:48 - where you where is the execute this
61:50 - program
61:51 - i'm not 100 sure what you're asking uh
61:54 - but it looks like um rabbitworks was
61:56 - trying to answer and say it's a react
61:57 - native app so
61:59 - native mobile app um or webview inside
62:02 - that app so
62:03 - yeah when we do go mobile it won't be a
62:05 - webview or it will actually like
62:08 - make it a real native
62:11 - native app so
62:13 - um
62:14 - we could also use electron uh or
62:17 - something like electron to make it a
62:18 - desktop app
62:20 - so right now what i'm thinking is uh web
62:22 - app will be first
62:24 - and then we'll work on android and ios
62:28 - and
62:29 - we might do electron just
62:31 - to give an example of how to do electron
62:34 - i just don't really see like
62:36 - considering the target audience
62:39 - i think they're way more likely to
62:42 - access it on like their parents phones
62:44 - as an app or
62:46 - on
62:47 - on a computer just as a website
62:50 - uh but i mean i could see like
62:52 - maybe some parents aren't comfortable
62:53 - letting their children on the web
62:55 - unsupervised which is definitely a bad
62:57 - idea
62:58 - so like potentially if they didn't have
63:00 - a lot of time to supervise they could
63:02 - just like turn off the internet but if
63:04 - they had downloaded the
63:06 - the desktop app version it would still
63:08 - work
63:10 - so
63:11 - i think there's uh
63:14 - there's probably value in that
63:20 - actually there's a way to do windows 10
63:22 - apps too now from react native so
63:25 - we might try that because i'm interested
63:27 - to see how that works i've never i've
63:28 - never seen it done yet and i've never
63:30 - done it so that's another option
63:34 - julian says the yellow kind of hurts my
63:35 - eyes yeah it
63:37 - yeah definitely not set on these colors
63:39 - yet
63:41 - no face says it looks terrible
63:44 - again yeah
63:45 - they were just whatever colors i thought
63:47 - of while i was typing it out
63:56 - um rexxon ma says i'm doing android
63:59 - development now uh which keyboard do you
64:02 - normally or i'm sorry i struggle with
64:04 - those tags and attributes
64:09 - okay
64:11 - yeah i guess
64:16 - i'm not sure are you talking about the
64:18 - uh like the jsx syntax
64:21 - and stuff like that yeah if you're not
64:23 - used to that
64:25 - then i could i could definitely see is
64:26 - that being
64:27 - a little difficult
64:30 - um
64:32 - dark
64:34 - dark on these i'm not sure how to
64:36 - pronounce that says which keyboard do
64:38 - you normally use the macbook one yeah so
64:40 - i normally just use the
64:42 - so i have two macbooks uh my work is uh
64:45 - like a brand new macbook pro
64:47 - and then i have a 2015 macbook pro
64:50 - um that's my personal one so i use those
64:52 - keyboards most they are a little
64:54 - different but they're they're similar
64:56 - enough that there's usually not too much
64:58 - of a difference but then like
64:59 - for my pc i have this keyboard
65:03 - um
65:04 - which uh
65:06 - like the the distance that you have to
65:08 - travel like to click a key is
65:10 - significantly more
65:12 - than on like the very low profile
65:15 - macbook pro keyboards
65:16 - so it it kind of messes me up
65:19 - um and then like the there's obvious
65:22 - differences between the desktop and the
65:24 - mac keyboard that
65:25 - it's just like extra
65:27 - stuff that i have to think about
65:30 - that kind of throws me off uh so i'm
65:33 - kind of thinking about getting a
65:34 - different keyboard anyway this is just
65:36 - the one that came with my computer
65:39 - um
65:40 - but i i'm in the process of buying a
65:42 - house so i'm going to move soon so i
65:43 - don't want to buy anything now because
65:45 - i'll just have to pack it up and move it
65:47 - and within the next month
65:49 - so maybe maybe after i get all moved in
65:51 - and stuff i could think about
65:53 - getting a new keyboard that may be more
65:57 - kind of comfortable
66:02 - um rex on moss says is this recap um
66:08 - uh we were recapping i guess so no
66:16 - oh and it looks like rexxon ma was was
66:18 - pretty bored because i got a little
66:20 - sleeping emoji and a walking emoji so i
66:23 - guess that meant
66:24 - it was boring
66:26 - so they are walking away so apologies
66:29 - for that rexxon
66:31 - or rexion
66:34 - maybe next time it'll be a little bit
66:37 - less
66:39 - less boring for you
66:43 - all right so edwin asks so vs code over
66:46 - sublime why
66:47 - um
66:48 - i don't know if it's still like this but
66:50 - the last time i checked sublime code
66:52 - costs money
66:54 - is that true
66:55 - um maybe i'm mistaken uh
66:57 - visual studio code is free
67:01 - and also i may be mistaken but sublime i
67:05 - thought was a mac only program but vs
67:08 - code is cross-platform
67:10 - so
67:11 - those are my main reasons for using vs
67:13 - code instead of sublime
67:15 - if i'm mistaken about those though
67:17 - please let me know i probably won't
67:19 - switch because i'm used to this
67:21 - but
67:25 - for somebody just starting out trying to
67:27 - figure out
67:28 - sublime might be a good option as well
67:35 - um
67:37 - do you have some video about python uh
67:40 - no i don't have any videos about python
67:42 - but there are probably python videos on
67:44 - this channel on the free codecamp
67:45 - youtube channel
67:48 - edwin says thanks for doing this by the
67:49 - way you're welcome
67:51 - thanks for watching
67:52 - um dpi gaming says what game are you
67:54 - making uh it's a game called battle math
67:57 - i
67:58 - i played it
68:00 - um
68:02 - i played it on a white board with my son
68:04 - when he was first learning math problems
68:07 - and so i'm trying to make a
68:09 - an actual like computer game version of
68:12 - it
68:12 - so it's just a game where you play
68:17 - you do math problems if you get them
68:18 - right you defeat an enemy if you get
68:20 - them wrong more enemies show up
68:28 - uh dpi gaming says show please all right
68:30 - let me go over to uh to the actual game
68:33 - so here's here's the game
68:35 - um and i'm gonna zoom in again i need to
68:38 - remember to zoom back out but
68:42 - so here's the game
68:44 - you type your answer here you can change
68:46 - the mode right so pretty pretty
68:49 - straightforward for now
68:50 - i
68:51 - definitely
68:52 - am interested in having
68:55 - better graphics and themes here
69:00 - abdullah says what's your name
69:02 - my name is jesse
69:11 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name
69:13 - let me know how it's supposed to be
69:14 - pronounced says the corsair mechanical
69:16 - keyboards are nice you know what i've
69:18 - i've tried those out in a store and i
69:20 - did really like them so they're on my
69:22 - list of potential uh keyboards
69:28 - kim perks says i have to go thank you
69:31 - for this video i'll be watching the next
69:32 - one oh awesome uh
69:35 - thanks for watching
69:39 - um i have a question have you ever gone
69:42 - to a server farm in person i have not
69:44 - but that would be cool to see
69:48 - abdullah says where are you from and
69:50 - where are you shifting to where are you
69:52 - moving to um i'm originally from west
69:54 - virginia in the united states
69:57 - um i live in ohio right now and i'm
70:00 - going to stay in ohio so i'm going to
70:01 - stay in the same city of stevenville
70:03 - ohio
70:04 - i'm just moving
70:06 - right now i'm kind of like outside the
70:07 - city limit so i'm going to move like
70:09 - closer into town
70:11 - basically it's just
70:12 - a bigger house when i bought this house
70:14 - i only had one kid and it was perfect
70:16 - now i have four kids and they're getting
70:18 - bigger and it's kind of tight
70:22 - it just seems like there's not a lot of
70:23 - space for anything so this would be a
70:25 - bigger house
70:27 - right now i'm just in the corner of a
70:28 - basement with tablecloths hanging
70:31 - instead of walls
70:32 - um so i should be able to make
70:36 - like a proper office
70:38 - there
70:39 - for a while just be in a basement
70:42 - but eventually i'd like to get walls put
70:44 - up and everything and so
70:47 - um
70:49 - should be
70:50 - it should be nice for the for the family
70:57 - no face says sublime has bugs i use atom
71:00 - no face says sublime text they used on
71:02 - windows
71:04 - okay and sava says sublime is okay
71:07 - anselmo okay so evidently i am totally
71:09 - mistaken and sublime is available
71:12 - on windows and linux
71:14 - um
71:15 - was it not at one time or am i just
71:17 - completely off here
71:20 - um
71:22 - jubal rawls says i use notepad plus plus
71:25 - vs code and atom atom is slow but i try
71:27 - to avoid microsoft
71:29 - now that they bought github um
71:33 - yeah i
71:35 - i used to use atom a lot
71:37 - and i did notice that atom is slower
71:40 - than than
71:41 - vs code
71:43 - other than that i love adam
71:48 - um
71:50 - junior
71:52 - says i use sublime with windows 7 and
71:54 - with javascript enhancement plug-in it's
71:56 - cool like ide sublime
71:59 - uh lambo of environment okay so
72:01 - evidently sublime is is better than i
72:03 - thought so apologies
72:05 - um
72:06 - maybe sublime is is definitely more
72:09 - versatile okay
72:11 - var uh diovoli says uh west virginia
72:15 - um
72:16 - it's beautiful
72:18 - yeah it is for sure um if you don't know
72:21 - about west virginia it's one of the
72:22 - poorest states in the united states but
72:25 - it's also one of the most beautiful over
72:27 - 70 percent of the land area is is forest
72:30 - so there's a lot of great like
72:32 - mountains trees um
72:35 - like rivers and streams people go white
72:37 - water rafting and skiing and
72:40 - great if you are really into the
72:41 - outdoors and camping and hiking
72:44 - awesome state for that
72:46 - if you're really into like
72:47 - big cities and things like that it's not
72:50 - a good place for you
72:52 - none of the cities here are big
72:53 - we have no professional sports teams so
72:56 - like
72:56 - um
72:58 - it's uh it's definitely different than a
73:00 - lot of the other states
73:02 - but it does get made fun of because
73:05 - um
73:06 - we're very poor spit state uh so it's it
73:10 - gets made fun of a lot but it's
73:11 - definitely beautiful
73:14 - um
73:16 - michael creole said did doing this help
73:18 - you get your new job
73:20 - um
73:23 - doing doing what sorry michael i'm not
73:25 - sure what you're referring to so do
73:27 - doing what help you get your new job
73:30 - um
73:31 - varsas i started using sublime in linux
73:33 - environment around 2014-ish wow
73:37 - all right evidently i i have no idea
73:39 - what i'm talking about in regard to
73:41 - sublime
73:42 - so i'm i definitely
73:46 - how did i not know this
73:53 - jason says probably the last place to be
73:55 - touched by cyberpunk how yeah
73:58 - if you're referring to west virginia
73:59 - then yeah i'd say
74:02 - so
74:03 - west virginia is like
74:07 - if if like
74:08 - everything goes like terrible right and
74:10 - like there's some type of apocalypse and
74:12 - the cities are destroyed like west
74:15 - virginia is the place that will change
74:17 - the least
74:18 - right people will probably be living in
74:20 - the hills of west virginia
74:22 - and their life will barely change
74:24 - right so
74:26 - um it's not that's kind of life's not
74:29 - for everybody but
74:31 - if you're into that it's it's a great
74:32 - place for it
74:39 - uh sava says vs code is awesome i don't
74:41 - know why people wouldn't use it yeah i i
74:43 - really like vs code but i mean there are
74:45 - really good options out there so
74:48 - uh it's definitely not the only
74:50 - or maybe even not the best option
74:53 - oh michael says doing the live streams
74:54 - and helping other people yeah doing the
74:56 - live streams and like the conference
74:58 - talks and stuff was huge for me trying
75:01 - to find a job so like a couple months
75:03 - ago i had a big job search and went on a
75:05 - bunch of interviews and uh if you're
75:07 - interested in that check out my youtube
75:09 - channel i have a couple of videos about
75:11 - it um the links in the in the
75:14 - description uh in this video
75:16 - um i go over
75:19 - a lot of what what happened and what
75:21 - helped and what didn't help in my job
75:23 - search but yeah definitely i got asked
75:26 - in my interviews a lot about
75:28 - uh about this actually speaking of that
75:30 - i'm gonna have to end this stream in in
75:31 - just a minute here and
75:34 - do my job
75:38 - let's see
75:39 - all right just a few more questions my
75:41 - voice is starting to go too
75:49 - all right michael says uh let me
75:52 - introduce you to my mississippi yeah i
75:54 - guess mississippi is probably pretty
75:56 - comparable to west virginia it's a
75:58 - little warmer in mississippi but
76:00 - in terms of like economic status and
76:02 - stuff it's it's comparable
76:08 - oh wow phoenix says the free code camp
76:11 - watermark is over your face can you
76:12 - change the frame position i never knew
76:14 - that is it is it like that for everybody
76:19 - let me know i mean yeah i can definitely
76:21 - change it
76:25 - um
76:26 - smmq says i'm a beginner uh how or how
76:30 - do i start
76:31 - uh go to
76:32 - freecodecamp.org and sign up there and
76:35 - do their free lessons that's a great
76:37 - place to start
76:39 - um jason lima says boot camp or computer
76:41 - science degree if you could pick one
76:44 - if i had a scholarship and i could go to
76:46 - school for free or for very inexpensive
76:49 - and not have to take out loans
76:51 - i would do a cs degree like assuming i
76:54 - didn't
76:55 - let's say like i didn't have a family or
76:56 - anything like it was just on my own then
76:58 - i'd do cs degree
77:00 - if i had to pay fully for that school
77:04 - forget it i'd never i'd never get a
77:06 - regular degree um and i would go with a
77:09 - boot camp the loans are just so so crazy
77:14 - okay um
77:20 - michael cruz says okay so the watermark
77:22 - is on the youtube site but not on the
77:24 - roku app
77:26 - okay
77:34 - all right i'm gonna have to to finish up
77:36 - here because i gotta um
77:39 - log into my work computer and get
77:40 - started um at my my software engineering
77:44 - job uh but it was awesome
77:46 - um talking with you all i think we had a
77:48 - really good q a we we got some uh
77:52 - really nice ugly themes going here so
77:55 - uh we'll we'll fix that um
77:58 - if you all have suggestions for themes
78:00 - you know definitely send them my way um
78:04 - otherwise you know hopefully i'll i'll
78:06 - get some inspiration for themes before
78:08 - uh friday uh the next stream so i hope
78:12 - to do another stream friday morning
78:13 - and uh if you can make it there it'll
78:15 - probably be at the same time it's 8 am
78:17 - eastern time
78:18 - all right
78:19 - thanks again so much for watching and
78:22 - until next time have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some styling on our react native web app so just as a quick intro this show is just about me uh coding live it's not rehearsed so i will make mistakes uh it's it's not exactly a tutorial so there definitely may be better ways to do what i'm trying to do um i set a pomodoro timer and we code for 25 minutes and then i take a little break and answer some questions in the live chat and we'll do that probably twice and i'll be live live coding and answering questions for about an hour today feel free to ask questions about anything you want i'll do my best to answer all the questions and i definitely encourage contributions so if you have ideas for the project you know go ahead and put those in the live chat as well so if you check the description to this video you can find a link to the github repo where you can see all the code that i'm using here so far uh everything is pretty much in app.js we haven't broken anything else out into separate components yet although we we probably will soon and let's see oops we gotta start it okay so we built this out using create react app uh but we're also using react native web and that means we're gonna be using react native syntax but it is rendering to the dom instead of uh android or or ios all right let's start up the timer okay uh this is the the github repo and i guess i'll throw this link in the chat as well just in case so i have a few of you saying hi so hey how's it going all right so here's what we have so far it doesn't look great so let me tell you what i'm thinking in terms of styling and then i'll get some feedback and we'll go from there so right off the bat i say since the target audience is children i'll probably approach the styling to this a little bit different than i normally would for for an app we want to keep the inputs and the fonts larger than normal um let's see probably keep the colors like pretty bright okay and other than that just like anything like play any playful elements we could add will probably be be good as well so let's let's think about these uh characters so right now this is supposed to be like the hero character and these are the enemies so i'm thinking maybe we could um use some css to style these i don't know i go back and forth so like my ideas are either like we could try to find like some like sprites to use right like video game sprites right uh and have like characters that look like real characters or we could keep it i don't know more of just like normal divs and just do some styling on it uh to make them look different so i there's some pretty cool stuff you can do with just css uh i'll let y'all think about that for a minute and let me know in the chat what you think like should we try to find you know images to use uh for our for our characters or uh should we see if we can do some some css stuff uh so i'm i genuinely am just not sure at this point what i'd what i'd rather do uh you know i imagine the css stuff has the advantage of the the overall game being smaller in terms of file size but i don't know that it'll be that big of a difference also some some other ideas i had for styling is that depending on the game mode uh the colors could change right uh potentially like the enemies could change right so the addition enemies would be different than the subtraction enemies right uh different colors at least um maybe maybe different background right i'm not right now it's very bright it's very bright and white so we could definitely go with a different background okay all right i'm gonna go to the chat really quick and just see what you all think about um about whether to go with images or just some some cool css stuff um jake knife says definitely use images vincent says yes you sprites sergey says svg actually yeah if we could find some svgs that that would be really cool um muhammad says css can be better you have more control over it that's true if if we could find svgs some like svg images we could maybe have the best of both worlds where we could still use css to manipulate the images and have control like potentially we could change colors um programmatically um sprites okay vincent says so why not use sprites yeah i'm i'm open i'm open to that okay so my next question would be does anybody know where a good place to get sprites are like right now i'd probably be looking for some free stuff but i'm i'm not opposed to like paying for for good stuff i mean um you know maybe some cool backgrounds too might not be a bad idea uh so i just don't know where the best place to get that is so if anybody has any ideas uh put them in the chat if you want to paste a link it probably won't show up but i'll still be able to see it uh just no one else will be able to see it um so i'm not going to take time to like go search for sprites right now because it'll probably be boring to just watch me do google searches so let's try to work on some of the other styles for now so i imagine let's see in web app mode positioning is not a huge deal but on different screen sizes we're probably going to run into some issues so we do need to consider that might want to maybe just like decrease the size of these at some point but probably wait until we figure out whether we're using sprites or not to actually do that um so let's check it all right let's look at maybe some some color schemes and we need to make if i want things to change we probably need to set up a theme so let's go ahead and do that now and just set up a like a css theme that can be easily changed based on state okay so currently since the entire app is just in this one app.js file this is going to be pretty easy um to set up a theme uh eventually we will have to probably pass down some things but i think it should still be okay sorry i'm yawning again i think i'm actually getting sick i had my throat really hurt so i might be a little bit more tired and slow uh today so do we have css yet i can't remember if we did it yeah we do okay cool um so we do have oh yeah we have some styles in here we have some colors um what i want to do based on our state is is switch that out so uh what kind of themes we're gonna need hmm maybe we should just base the themes off of like the edition theme the subtraction theme that i think that kind of makes that makes sense right so if we're going to do it like that then we could just use mode so we don't really need a different uh thing in state right so for now let's just set some background colors on the main container div and then it'll be really obvious just to test things out it's probably not going to look really good right now uh but it'll be a good um it'll be a good test okay so for our styles let's say we're gonna have styles equal so we'll have styles equals or styles.root but we're going to do two styles so when we want to add more than one style we're gonna just make a an array inside this this object right and then we can just separate everything with commas just like a normal array so we could also do styles and then i'm gonna do um instead of the normal dot syntax right i'm gonna do let's see i'm gonna do this style start all right i'm gonna put a variable in here so right so i don't want to put dots so i'm gonna put this state um mode and actually while we're at it uh let's let's do some um destructuring so we don't have to use this state everywhere right uh so if you're not familiar with destructuring here's what we're gonna do so we're gonna say const and we're gonna put in some of the elements of states we're gonna do mode let's see what else we have here let's just put all our state um i'm just going to copy this for now and paste it down here just so that i can see it and then we'll just get rid of it so let's do mode answer uh number of enemies one val2 uh one and operator okay if this doesn't make sense right now we'll it will in a second and then we're going to say equals this dot state okay so now that we have all of these here every place where we say this dot state down below we can get rid of so it's it's going to clean things up a little bit all right so i'm just going to use the uh multiple cursors here there we go and get rid of them all yeah so now we don't have to keep typing the state uh and it definitely cleans things up a bit selected value language uh oh what did i do did i forget hmm was that really this state uh you know what this was probably left over from the example i copied and pasted and i just never never did anything so uh selected value for this um picker is always gonna equal the mode okay all right so let's save it and just go go over just to show that you know everything still works so subtraction multiplication division also looks like uh our our selector here our picker is not wide enough so we need to change the the width of that okay but other than that everything's still still working um see there we go uh yeah still working okay now what will happen is uh we can have styles for each mode and we'll put that down here right so we can have addition and let's just say um background color and we're gonna make them just super uh obvious for now background color green and we'll just copy this for each one and change it up subtraction subtraction uh multiplication and division and pink yellow and orange i'm trying to pick different colors than we already have on the screen for other things okay let's see if that worked oh actually multiplication doesn't work yellow let me uh don't tell me i misspelled this uh let me go case multiplication i'm gonna copy and paste this so that i don't even have to worry about spelling all right let's try multiplication there we go it must have been a misspelling and division that orange does not really look orange that's kind of weird maybe it's just my screen maybe it looks different for you actually i think it's my screen because on my other screen um i can see it and it looks way more orange on my other screen uh all right okay so that this is not like the prettiest thing in the world right now um but at least we can see like how it how it could work here um okay now i did think while i was doing that i thought actually this may not be the best way to do it because i can pretty much only change the background here right um so what i could do i could actually make separate um style sheets right so instead of uh just having caught styles we could have like we could have our regular cons styles right and then i could also have a const for addition styles subtraction styles right and then up here so i'm trying to find where we have this up here instead of styles dot root styles dot mode it would be like styles dot root but then we could have addition styles or whatever um dot root and this would be the thing what would change is the name the basically the mode right so i think that's a better way to go because then we could have uh styles for a lot of other stuff right um for our our heroes and our enemies right so i think that's a better way to go let me check my time see if you have enough time to get to do that yeah we have about seven minutes so um let's see it's just checking the um chat really quick to see uh if i'd done anything really crazy okay so let's do that let's let me first just copy everything here we're not going to change every single style here but for now actually before i copy everything four times um let me copy it one time then make the adjustments and then copy that one so we don't have to keep making adjustments so our input is unlikely to change so let's take that out for now our text size is unlikely to change same way with this is just a row container um we're going to keep our hero and enemy in there because those will probably change our container will be the same our battlefield i'm going to take that out for now but you know we may want to actually have some sort of like more intricate battlefield background right and then for this we're no longer going to need addition subtraction multiplication down here what we'll have then is just a background color all right on root and then here we would say edition right all right so we'll just take that out and now i'll just copy this one and let's change this to subtraction and give this the background color okay and this is going to be multiplication which i'm definitely going to copy and paste since evidently i can't spell that consistently and we're going to give it that uh yellow background which these are likely going to change at some point but um it'll give us a nice visual indicator at least for now and one more and that's division division and orange and then okay i think it's probably complaining that we haven't actually used these styles is defined objection actually that's really weird did i copy styles again i copied too many times yeah i did okay let me get rid of that one okay so let's see if this will work i know um my my linter is not going to like that i'm not using those but let's see if this works um so we're going to switch this up so it'll say um actually can i even do this i don't know if anybody caught that this might not work um rabbitworks asks why am i copying so much code just to change the background color well because we're we're going to change more than the background color so i just copied it to save us some typing later but essentially like all those elements i copied will change all of them but now that i did this now i'm not sure it'll work because it's gonna be mode yeah this is not gonna work all right i'll just try it but i'm pretty sure this isn't gonna work yep it's not going to work oops well i have a syntax error too so it's definitely not going to work all right yeah all right how can i do this all right so if you don't realize what i just did that that was uh i really wish i would have thought of before i just did all this other stuff um i i switched around so that basically the variable part would be here but that's that does not work you can't do that so i was trying to make it so that it would work for multiple things all right let me uh timer's up so let me set this let me go to the um to the chat here and we'll have to rethink i guess how we want to do this theme um let's see i just saw michael creole says can you do a switch yeah i'm wondering if um i'm wondering if we may end up doing some sort of switch all right let me scroll up so i can catch as many questions as i can during this this five minute time period here um let's see aag says which language you use uh javascript mostly it looks like some some other people have the same question so rjs how are you i'm i'm doing all right i think i'm getting sick but it's i don't think it's serious i think it'll just be like a cold or something like that um willie says hi there for coding being this advanced is it too late for me to start oh no no it's definitely not too late uh for you to start i'm not sure if you mean like to start following this stream in which case i'd say no it's not too late or like just to start learning to code like in general either way it's not too late john paul says think crazy ideas cool i'll try um we have a question i'm not sure how to pronounce your name so sorry but uh the question is will web dev die out uh i don't think it'll die out uh it it honestly seems like people are doing more things on the web than they ever have done right there are more complicated applications now for the web than at any point so uh and and think about the companies that are the biggest companies in the world are companies who do things on the web right uh facebook uh google amazon uh those are all webbased companies and their their revenue comes through the web so i do not think web dev will die out anytime soon um in fact i don't know if you all saw the announcement from google about stadia but google's has this big gaming thing now that's basically running through a web browser so i know that's like not exactly web dev but you know that the platform is the web uh willie says i was thinking about starting with html5 css javascript java and then some app coding and maybe games um willie yeah definitely start out with your html css javascript um and then you'll be able to do a ton of stuff with just that and you'll probably have a good idea about like what what you want to do you know after that uh let's see muhammad asks what am i doing here oh um i'm building a math game for kids so just something really simple right now we're just into like single digit math uh francis says this is quite impressive but i'm still a beginner will i catch up along the way yeah yeah you can catch up and and if you always if you want to you can check out the the previous recordings uh rabbitworks says um for the styling that we were just doing um put it in an array um and object for the color let's see um jason lima says what is there other than the web i think this is in regard to the you know will web dev die out says what is there other than web mobile desktop yeah i would say like that's it mobile and desktop you could say like in terms of programming like console gaming that's programming internet of things so i mean it's you could break it down but so many things are tied into the web now it's the lines between different types of development i i think are are getting really blurred because it seems like everything at some point ties into the web so maybe like traditional web dev of like hey i know html and css i can do web development that that is probably already dying or dead right most successful websites or web apps need more than that but web dev is now it's become more than it was it we have more capabilities on the web than we've had before so web dev is not going to die it's just it just adapts and takes on more capabilities all right um let me let me take a note of where we are in the chat and so i can go back to it and i'm gonna restart my pomodoro timer and let's try to do more okay so where we ended with our coding was i just broke it so what i did let me talk through what i did and what i was trying to do and let's see if we can figure out an answer here so what i would like to do is have completely different themes depending on the state so we're going to go off of this mode okay so the mode will switch between addition subtraction multiplication and division and then based on that i've created different themes down here or at least started to for each one of those for the addition subtraction multiplication division right and these are style sheets so these are essentially javascript objects so what i need to do then is switch them out however what i had hoped i could do and then realized i couldn't do was basically make this first part here so we're using you know javascript object and here it works because i can say styles.root so styles is an object but here what i'm trying to do is use the value of mode as the object so so mode itself is a string but what i wanted to refer to is the name of huh i wonder all right so what i need is some way and we can totally rethink everything but like at this point i need some way to designate um which style sheet i want to use here so we're going to keep styles always that'll be like our base styles and then we'll cut down these um themes to be as like small as possible and only change what uh what needs to be changed but i need some way to put that in there so let me see uh michael creo says uh put it in the existing switch uh or object literal okay yeah all right let's take a look at that switch statement and see what we could do there all right so right now we are hmm you know what how did i do this i did a theme so i could toggle a theme on a project recently let me open it on my other computer really quick it's i already have it open on my other computer so let me just check it so let's see i in my other project i used like a theme.js file oh okay i see what i did okay this is uh this might work um all right let me run this by you and see what if we take these themes and instead of using um like stylesheet.create here which normally i would definitely recommend we just make them like straight objects right um and then we say like basically we just put the values in here so let me do it with um addition first just to show you what i mean and uh see if if that could work so actually think will that work do this all right yeah let me each all right so let's let's do this what if we did themes so we'll have this this themes object right within the themes object we'll have one called edition um and then within addition we could say like background color um and we could again we'll call it green okay and let's just we'll make two just so we could switch and we'll make one called um subtraction i believe subtraction was pink okay so we have addition and subtraction um and then and then we can have uh let's say active theme is going to be is going to equal let's actually let's switch that up oops and i messed this up already background background color there we go i knew that did not look right okay so we have that here now in here we'll make a let's say we'll say active theme is going to equal theme and that's where we'll put mode right that says seam is not defined what theme is defined didn't i define it down here oh themes okay so our active theme is themes.mode now in here we can say background background color equals um let's see active theme dot let's see background background color right i think that'll work okay all right let's see if that works if it works then i'll explain more about why it works okay let's try subtraction now yay and these ones won't work right because we don't have anything for them yet okay all right so this works so basically what we've what we've done then is um active theme is equal to whatever theme name is equal to the mode right which is addition subtraction multiplication division right so then we can just use active theme in here so we don't we don't ever have to worry about well what's the mode down here because we've already set what the active theme is so then down here we could add as many different things as we want like as many different attributes oops not there here right and and we will we'll add i'm sure we'll add different colors for various things but then that way that gives us a really easy way to switch themes so and now uh we can actually get rid of a lot of a lot of what we've done let me get rid of them up here too because we had um actually if i just copy these this should work yeah so let's copy that and multiplication nice all right so that'll work let's do a little bit of cleanup here okay cool so now we have our all our base styles here and then we can override any of those from here and we'll just verify that that works so everything should work awesome cool so now we have colors maybe not the the prettiest of colors but for a target audience for kids this this might actually be fun right i don't really know maybe i'll have to look at some color theory for children if i before like we really decide on what the colors should be um but for now this this is okay um probably the only other thing that i'd want to do right now is change the colors of uh like the enemies maybe um in terms of usability i i guess like the most pressing thing would just be this needs to be wider so let's make that wider so that the entire thing is visible um i don't know what it is right now let's see so that's our our picker and i don't think we have any styles for that yet um oh okay so we do we have a width set to 100 uh let's see if like 150 would work i think 150 will work see how that looks yeah for sure that works it looks a little awkward but at least that fits for all of them uh also it looks like a little bit tall i mean i want the inputs to be nice and big so that it's easy for kids to use like a touch screen but i think we can maybe go with like 40 for the height and see how that looks oops didn't mean to hit that key okay all right there we go 40 looks better all right that's good and i do have this text this battle math text let's give this a style uh style equals sorry about my typing uh i just i only use this keyboard pretty much when i do these streams twice a week and sometimes not even then so um it's totally different from like the normal macbook ebook that i use keyboard that i use so it definitely messes up my typing let's just call this title so we'll have styles.title um we want our title to be bigger so we're going to put this just in our our normal styles uh so we want font size to be um let's try 24 pixels and see how that looks and then we'll have to figure out like what kind of font family we want to font family let's go comic sans i wonder if that's like if that's will work by default nope failing to compile what did i do oops i didn't put a comma let's just have fun we'll put comic sans in there i know comic sans usually awful oh no it won't work uh yeah maybe i'll have to look up what it is um let's see uh there we go web safe fonts okay comic sans ms okay so let's try that actually that's why we're here let's just see if there's another one that i like better let's go with this i just want something that looks like you know kid kid friendly right i don't really want to go with comic sans like um as my final solution here oops all right i'm just gonna use uh back ticks that way this won't matter i could have used single quotes too but um my hand just hit the back tick first there we go okay so here's our our comic sans um i definitely want a little bit more padding between uh the top of this and the bottom of that i don't know just let's see i don't know that still looks really like large what is my am i zooming in on this i am wow okay for some reason i was super zoomed in on this so now this makes a lot more sense as to why everything looked huge so let me let me check my zoom level all right so this is the real level of zoom all right i think we have some work to do uh because now this is a totally different story all right so we got seven minutes let's try to increase a lot of of what we've been doing here okay i would like to take this these styles for the picker and move them down okay so um let's copy these and we'll actually cut them and we'll go we'll say styles.picker okay and i'm gonna uh switch this so that it's actually oops let's make it 60 and let's make the title 32 and let's make these um actually let's let's do this let's make let's make a character um style and that's where we'll put our width and height so that way we don't have to change them both all the time and i'm going to switch them up and let's give them a double the width and the height that they have right now see how that looks um and then the math text hmm all right let's let's try that out with uh 26. maybe let's bump that up to 28 for now i know it's not a lot but we'll see how it looks uh we also need to add um on our hero and enemies where are we at with those there we are styles.hero so we'll add here is styles dot character and we'll do the same thing for our enemies okay all right now let's let's see what that looks like okay not bad i made made things a little bit bigger hmm that's weird it's not it's not letting me change this there we go now that we have all the space hmm interesting okay we have about three minutes left before we go to the questions um if anybody has any suggestions now that i finally realized that i had this zoomed in a lot um let me know i'm thinking i could definitely do with some more padding like top and bottom padding let's see so we could do padding vertical and say something like um just do like 16 uh pixels for now 16 units uh react native is basically unitless okay it just felt a little tight up here and down here and we do have like so we're using flexbox so like right now this container is supposed to take up all the space that's left left over after this container and this container does do their things so what i could do is maybe make this container bigger do i not have this in an actual container interesting okay um yeah so let's say it would come up to like here and i can have this stuff come up here it just seems too far down right now you know i would kind of like to have better looking the picker's okay i maybe would like to have better looking input so i do want to look into that as well to see like um maybe there's better styled inputs that we could bring in all right what do you think let me know um berto says just think if this was for atari you would be almost completely done actually that would be kind of cool what if what if we made a um like a react native uh plugin that lets you have atari as a target like you could design it in with react native but it it compiled down to be able to play on an atari that would actu that would be really cool i have no idea what it would take but there's a guy i work with that um that used to write programs for the atari i don't know if he still does but he would know what it would take to do that all right so let me i don't really have enough time left on my pomodoro timer to do anything so let's just go right to the questions here i'm going to scroll up to where we left off um actually let me um let me commit this stuff oops okay let's do it get commit a.m so we're gonna oops we're gonna add and commit at the same time let's say we're adding a new feature and we'll say we add themes for each mode okay so we didn't add full themes but i mean that's basically what we did so let's commit that and push it okay since it's just me working on this right now and it's a small like side project i'm committing straight to master normally if you're working on like open source or a project with a team you would want to do every change on a separate branch and then submit a pull request but for your own projects i mean it's fine to do it like this once you actually launch you probably don't want to have like your master branch the one you work on all the time you want to work on maybe a dev branch all right um lubomir uh says hey why did you choose react over ujs in one sentence one sentence i know react but i don't know view okay if you want a better explanation than that let me know let's see a monster challenge all right pub g skilled okay i think i think there's a conversation going on between people in the chat so i'm gonna skip through some of those um lucas says view or react um i've heard good things about vue but i've never used it i work with react all the time so that's definitely my my goto if i need to build something but i have nothing against you okay let's see all right okay uh there's a question about where did this program where you where is the execute this program i'm not 100 sure what you're asking uh but it looks like um rabbitworks was trying to answer and say it's a react native app so native mobile app um or webview inside that app so yeah when we do go mobile it won't be a webview or it will actually like make it a real native native app so um we could also use electron uh or something like electron to make it a desktop app so right now what i'm thinking is uh web app will be first and then we'll work on android and ios and we might do electron just to give an example of how to do electron i just don't really see like considering the target audience i think they're way more likely to access it on like their parents phones as an app or on on a computer just as a website uh but i mean i could see like maybe some parents aren't comfortable letting their children on the web unsupervised which is definitely a bad idea so like potentially if they didn't have a lot of time to supervise they could just like turn off the internet but if they had downloaded the the desktop app version it would still work so i think there's uh there's probably value in that actually there's a way to do windows 10 apps too now from react native so we might try that because i'm interested to see how that works i've never i've never seen it done yet and i've never done it so that's another option julian says the yellow kind of hurts my eyes yeah it yeah definitely not set on these colors yet no face says it looks terrible again yeah they were just whatever colors i thought of while i was typing it out um rexxon ma says i'm doing android development now uh which keyboard do you normally or i'm sorry i struggle with those tags and attributes okay yeah i guess i'm not sure are you talking about the uh like the jsx syntax and stuff like that yeah if you're not used to that then i could i could definitely see is that being a little difficult um dark dark on these i'm not sure how to pronounce that says which keyboard do you normally use the macbook one yeah so i normally just use the so i have two macbooks uh my work is uh like a brand new macbook pro and then i have a 2015 macbook pro um that's my personal one so i use those keyboards most they are a little different but they're they're similar enough that there's usually not too much of a difference but then like for my pc i have this keyboard um which uh like the the distance that you have to travel like to click a key is significantly more than on like the very low profile macbook pro keyboards so it it kind of messes me up um and then like the there's obvious differences between the desktop and the mac keyboard that it's just like extra stuff that i have to think about that kind of throws me off uh so i'm kind of thinking about getting a different keyboard anyway this is just the one that came with my computer um but i i'm in the process of buying a house so i'm going to move soon so i don't want to buy anything now because i'll just have to pack it up and move it and within the next month so maybe maybe after i get all moved in and stuff i could think about getting a new keyboard that may be more kind of comfortable um rex on moss says is this recap um uh we were recapping i guess so no oh and it looks like rexxon ma was was pretty bored because i got a little sleeping emoji and a walking emoji so i guess that meant it was boring so they are walking away so apologies for that rexxon or rexion maybe next time it'll be a little bit less less boring for you all right so edwin asks so vs code over sublime why um i don't know if it's still like this but the last time i checked sublime code costs money is that true um maybe i'm mistaken uh visual studio code is free and also i may be mistaken but sublime i thought was a mac only program but vs code is crossplatform so those are my main reasons for using vs code instead of sublime if i'm mistaken about those though please let me know i probably won't switch because i'm used to this but for somebody just starting out trying to figure out sublime might be a good option as well um do you have some video about python uh no i don't have any videos about python but there are probably python videos on this channel on the free codecamp youtube channel edwin says thanks for doing this by the way you're welcome thanks for watching um dpi gaming says what game are you making uh it's a game called battle math i i played it um i played it on a white board with my son when he was first learning math problems and so i'm trying to make a an actual like computer game version of it so it's just a game where you play you do math problems if you get them right you defeat an enemy if you get them wrong more enemies show up uh dpi gaming says show please all right let me go over to uh to the actual game so here's here's the game um and i'm gonna zoom in again i need to remember to zoom back out but so here's the game you type your answer here you can change the mode right so pretty pretty straightforward for now i definitely am interested in having better graphics and themes here abdullah says what's your name my name is jesse sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name let me know how it's supposed to be pronounced says the corsair mechanical keyboards are nice you know what i've i've tried those out in a store and i did really like them so they're on my list of potential uh keyboards kim perks says i have to go thank you for this video i'll be watching the next one oh awesome uh thanks for watching um i have a question have you ever gone to a server farm in person i have not but that would be cool to see abdullah says where are you from and where are you shifting to where are you moving to um i'm originally from west virginia in the united states um i live in ohio right now and i'm going to stay in ohio so i'm going to stay in the same city of stevenville ohio i'm just moving right now i'm kind of like outside the city limit so i'm going to move like closer into town basically it's just a bigger house when i bought this house i only had one kid and it was perfect now i have four kids and they're getting bigger and it's kind of tight it just seems like there's not a lot of space for anything so this would be a bigger house right now i'm just in the corner of a basement with tablecloths hanging instead of walls um so i should be able to make like a proper office there for a while just be in a basement but eventually i'd like to get walls put up and everything and so um should be it should be nice for the for the family no face says sublime has bugs i use atom no face says sublime text they used on windows okay and sava says sublime is okay anselmo okay so evidently i am totally mistaken and sublime is available on windows and linux um was it not at one time or am i just completely off here um jubal rawls says i use notepad plus plus vs code and atom atom is slow but i try to avoid microsoft now that they bought github um yeah i i used to use atom a lot and i did notice that atom is slower than than vs code other than that i love adam um junior says i use sublime with windows 7 and with javascript enhancement plugin it's cool like ide sublime uh lambo of environment okay so evidently sublime is is better than i thought so apologies um maybe sublime is is definitely more versatile okay var uh diovoli says uh west virginia um it's beautiful yeah it is for sure um if you don't know about west virginia it's one of the poorest states in the united states but it's also one of the most beautiful over 70 percent of the land area is is forest so there's a lot of great like mountains trees um like rivers and streams people go white water rafting and skiing and great if you are really into the outdoors and camping and hiking awesome state for that if you're really into like big cities and things like that it's not a good place for you none of the cities here are big we have no professional sports teams so like um it's uh it's definitely different than a lot of the other states but it does get made fun of because um we're very poor spit state uh so it's it gets made fun of a lot but it's definitely beautiful um michael creole said did doing this help you get your new job um doing doing what sorry michael i'm not sure what you're referring to so do doing what help you get your new job um varsas i started using sublime in linux environment around 2014ish wow all right evidently i i have no idea what i'm talking about in regard to sublime so i'm i definitely how did i not know this jason says probably the last place to be touched by cyberpunk how yeah if you're referring to west virginia then yeah i'd say so west virginia is like if if like everything goes like terrible right and like there's some type of apocalypse and the cities are destroyed like west virginia is the place that will change the least right people will probably be living in the hills of west virginia and their life will barely change right so um it's not that's kind of life's not for everybody but if you're into that it's it's a great place for it uh sava says vs code is awesome i don't know why people wouldn't use it yeah i i really like vs code but i mean there are really good options out there so uh it's definitely not the only or maybe even not the best option oh michael says doing the live streams and helping other people yeah doing the live streams and like the conference talks and stuff was huge for me trying to find a job so like a couple months ago i had a big job search and went on a bunch of interviews and uh if you're interested in that check out my youtube channel i have a couple of videos about it um the links in the in the description uh in this video um i go over a lot of what what happened and what helped and what didn't help in my job search but yeah definitely i got asked in my interviews a lot about uh about this actually speaking of that i'm gonna have to end this stream in in just a minute here and do my job let's see all right just a few more questions my voice is starting to go too all right michael says uh let me introduce you to my mississippi yeah i guess mississippi is probably pretty comparable to west virginia it's a little warmer in mississippi but in terms of like economic status and stuff it's it's comparable oh wow phoenix says the free code camp watermark is over your face can you change the frame position i never knew that is it is it like that for everybody let me know i mean yeah i can definitely change it um smmq says i'm a beginner uh how or how do i start uh go to freecodecamp.org and sign up there and do their free lessons that's a great place to start um jason lima says boot camp or computer science degree if you could pick one if i had a scholarship and i could go to school for free or for very inexpensive and not have to take out loans i would do a cs degree like assuming i didn't let's say like i didn't have a family or anything like it was just on my own then i'd do cs degree if i had to pay fully for that school forget it i'd never i'd never get a regular degree um and i would go with a boot camp the loans are just so so crazy okay um michael cruz says okay so the watermark is on the youtube site but not on the roku app okay all right i'm gonna have to to finish up here because i gotta um log into my work computer and get started um at my my software engineering job uh but it was awesome um talking with you all i think we had a really good q a we we got some uh really nice ugly themes going here so uh we'll we'll fix that um if you all have suggestions for themes you know definitely send them my way um otherwise you know hopefully i'll i'll get some inspiration for themes before uh friday uh the next stream so i hope to do another stream friday morning and uh if you can make it there it'll probably be at the same time it's 8 am eastern time all right thanks again so much for watching and until next time have a great day
