00:00 - for Loops you can run the same code
00:02 - multiple times using a loop the most
00:04 - common Loop in JavaScript is called a
00:06 - for Loop because it runs four a specific
00:08 - number of times here's the structure of
00:11 - the for Loop you always start with the
00:12 - word four and then you're going to have
00:14 - something in these parentheses you
00:16 - usually have three items there's the
00:18 - initialization and then you put a
00:20 - semicolon then you have the condition
00:23 - and then a semicolon and then the final
00:25 - expression and then the whatever is
00:26 - going to run in the for Loop would be in
00:28 - these curly braces over here now all of
00:30 - these things are optional but you have
00:33 - them in most Flor Loops the
00:35 - initialization is run just once to set
00:37 - up the the loop variable and every time
00:40 - the loop is run the condition statement
00:43 - is evaluated at the beginning the loop
00:46 - keeps going until the condition is false
00:48 - and then the final expression is
00:50 - evaluated at the end of each Loop
00:52 - iteration and is usually used to
00:54 - increment or decrement your Loop
00:56 - counter let me give you an example of
00:59 - this
01:00 - so in this example first outside of the
01:03 - for loop we're going to create an array
01:04 - called R array and set it to an empty
01:06 - array now we have the for Loop this is
01:09 - the initialization we are going to
01:11 - create the variable I and set that I
01:14 - equal to zero now here's the condition I
01:19 - is less than five so we are going to
01:21 - keep running the for Loop while I is
01:24 - less than five so as long as I is less
01:26 - than five we'll continue running this
01:28 - for loop at the end of each run of the
01:31 - loop we are going to increment I i+ plus
01:34 - just means we're going to add one to I
01:37 - so it's going to go through the loop the
01:39 - first time it's going to run this code
01:41 - within the brackets and it's going to
01:44 - push I onto the the array and remember I
01:48 - starts off with Z at zero it's going to
01:51 - push zero onto the array and then it's
01:55 - going to increment I remember it does
01:57 - this at the end so now I is one it's
01:59 - going to go through is going to push one
02:00 - onto the array it's going to go through
02:02 - push two push three push four after four
02:06 - we'll increment I to five before the for
02:09 - Loop goes it's going to check is I less
02:11 - than five no I is actually five I is not
02:14 - less than five so it's going only going
02:16 - to put push the number 0 through four
02:18 - onto the array let's check that out by
02:21 - console. logging
02:24 - it so yeah we got the array 0 1 2 3
02:28 - 4 you can also use a break statement to
02:32 - break out of a loop early so now I have
02:35 - if I is more than two break so if we run
02:41 - that it's just going to put 0 one two
02:45 - because after two I is more than two so
02:47 - it breaks out of the loop and then we're
02:49 - done with the loop now it's also common
02:51 - for Loops to iterate through an array so
02:55 - if an array already exists and has some
02:57 - items in it we can Loop through and and
03:00 - console.log or print out each item in
03:03 - that array so we're going to initialize
03:05 - I to equal Zer if I is less than r.
03:09 - length so that's the array and length is
03:11 - the length of the array so if I is less
03:13 - than the length of the array we are
03:15 - going to continue going through the
03:16 - array so once we get to the end of the
03:18 - array we'll be done with the for loop at
03:21 - the end we're going to increment I by
03:22 - One and we're just going to console.log
03:25 - R and then we just put the I variable as
03:29 - the index that we're of the array that
03:32 - we're trying to console. log so the
03:35 - first we're going to get the array index
03:37 - zero because I will equal Z and index 0
03:39 - will be 10 then we'll do index one 2 3 4
03:44 - because each run through the array we're
03:46 - going to increment I up one and that's
03:49 - going to go to the next index of the
03:50 - array if we run that see we got 10 9
03:54 - 876 if you have a multi-dimensional
03:57 - array you can use nested for Loop Loops
03:59 - to Loop through both the array and any
04:02 - subarrays let me show you an example of
04:07 - that okay so let's look at this we have
04:10 - this array variable which is a nested
04:13 - array so here's just there's one array
04:16 - there's the beginning of the array and
04:17 - there's the end of the array and inside
04:20 - the array are three other arrays so
04:23 - inside the first array here's index zero
04:26 - here's index one here's index two and in
04:30 - each of those indexes is another array
04:32 - so we have index zero and index one in
04:34 - each array so you can use nested for
04:38 - Loops to Loop through these both arrays
04:40 - here's our first for Loop here's the end
04:42 - of that and then here's our nested for
04:46 - Loop so we're going to initialize I to
04:49 - zero if I is less than array. length and
04:52 - the length of the array see we have 1 2
04:55 - 3 so the length of the array is three
04:58 - but now inside the the nested for Loop
05:01 - we have to initialize the variable
05:03 - differently so now instead of I we have
05:05 - J now if J is less than array index i.
05:10 - length when we're looking at the array
05:13 - index i. length that's the first item in
05:17 - the array which is the first array
05:19 - within the array so now the length of
05:21 - this is just two we have one two so
05:25 - we're going to then we're going to
05:26 - increment J so we're going to run
05:28 - through this first floor Loop and inside
05:30 - the first for loop we're basically going
05:32 - to go into the first array and now we're
05:35 - going to console.log each item in the
05:37 - first array we're going to array index I
05:41 - index J so the first index is what index
05:45 - in this first array which which would be
05:49 - if we're going to index zero that's this
05:51 - and then the index J will be what index
05:54 - in the second array in the nest array so
05:57 - we would get index zero in index one for
06:00 - J it's going to go through this inner
06:02 - for Loop to get both indexes in the
06:04 - first array then it's going to go back
06:06 - to the outer for Loop to bump up to this
06:08 - next array and then we're going to go
06:11 - through the inner four loop again to get
06:12 - both indexes in here and so on if we log
06:16 - if we conso that log that it's going to
06:19 - say 10 9 8 7 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so the first
06:23 - 109876 was from up here and then we have
06:25 - the 1 2 3 4 5 6 from down here well the
06:29 - those are for loops and nested for Loops

Cleaned transcript:

for Loops you can run the same code multiple times using a loop the most common Loop in JavaScript is called a for Loop because it runs four a specific number of times here's the structure of the for Loop you always start with the word four and then you're going to have something in these parentheses you usually have three items there's the initialization and then you put a semicolon then you have the condition and then a semicolon and then the final expression and then the whatever is going to run in the for Loop would be in these curly braces over here now all of these things are optional but you have them in most Flor Loops the initialization is run just once to set up the the loop variable and every time the loop is run the condition statement is evaluated at the beginning the loop keeps going until the condition is false and then the final expression is evaluated at the end of each Loop iteration and is usually used to increment or decrement your Loop counter let me give you an example of this so in this example first outside of the for loop we're going to create an array called R array and set it to an empty array now we have the for Loop this is the initialization we are going to create the variable I and set that I equal to zero now here's the condition I is less than five so we are going to keep running the for Loop while I is less than five so as long as I is less than five we'll continue running this for loop at the end of each run of the loop we are going to increment I i+ plus just means we're going to add one to I so it's going to go through the loop the first time it's going to run this code within the brackets and it's going to push I onto the the array and remember I starts off with Z at zero it's going to push zero onto the array and then it's going to increment I remember it does this at the end so now I is one it's going to go through is going to push one onto the array it's going to go through push two push three push four after four we'll increment I to five before the for Loop goes it's going to check is I less than five no I is actually five I is not less than five so it's going only going to put push the number 0 through four onto the array let's check that out by console. logging it so yeah we got the array 0 1 2 3 4 you can also use a break statement to break out of a loop early so now I have if I is more than two break so if we run that it's just going to put 0 one two because after two I is more than two so it breaks out of the loop and then we're done with the loop now it's also common for Loops to iterate through an array so if an array already exists and has some items in it we can Loop through and and console.log or print out each item in that array so we're going to initialize I to equal Zer if I is less than r. length so that's the array and length is the length of the array so if I is less than the length of the array we are going to continue going through the array so once we get to the end of the array we'll be done with the for loop at the end we're going to increment I by One and we're just going to console.log R and then we just put the I variable as the index that we're of the array that we're trying to console. log so the first we're going to get the array index zero because I will equal Z and index 0 will be 10 then we'll do index one 2 3 4 because each run through the array we're going to increment I up one and that's going to go to the next index of the array if we run that see we got 10 9 876 if you have a multidimensional array you can use nested for Loop Loops to Loop through both the array and any subarrays let me show you an example of that okay so let's look at this we have this array variable which is a nested array so here's just there's one array there's the beginning of the array and there's the end of the array and inside the array are three other arrays so inside the first array here's index zero here's index one here's index two and in each of those indexes is another array so we have index zero and index one in each array so you can use nested for Loops to Loop through these both arrays here's our first for Loop here's the end of that and then here's our nested for Loop so we're going to initialize I to zero if I is less than array. length and the length of the array see we have 1 2 3 so the length of the array is three but now inside the the nested for Loop we have to initialize the variable differently so now instead of I we have J now if J is less than array index i. length when we're looking at the array index i. length that's the first item in the array which is the first array within the array so now the length of this is just two we have one two so we're going to then we're going to increment J so we're going to run through this first floor Loop and inside the first for loop we're basically going to go into the first array and now we're going to console.log each item in the first array we're going to array index I index J so the first index is what index in this first array which which would be if we're going to index zero that's this and then the index J will be what index in the second array in the nest array so we would get index zero in index one for J it's going to go through this inner for Loop to get both indexes in the first array then it's going to go back to the outer for Loop to bump up to this next array and then we're going to go through the inner four loop again to get both indexes in here and so on if we log if we conso that log that it's going to say 10 9 8 7 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so the first 109876 was from up here and then we have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 from down here well the those are for loops and nested for Loops thanks for watching my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember
