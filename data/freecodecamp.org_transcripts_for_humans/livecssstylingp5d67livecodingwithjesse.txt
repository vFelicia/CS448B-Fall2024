00:03 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:06 - Jessie I'm Jessie and I apologize for
00:10 - being 7 minutes late I I had so many
00:15 - things happen all at once right when I
00:17 - was going to start so really sorry it
00:20 - got a couple emails from work and had to
00:24 - respond to those and I've I'm getting
00:29 - errors when I try to commit and when I
00:34 - tried to start the stream the button to
00:35 - start the stream was was like grayed out
00:37 - and I I couldn't get it to start it
00:40 - turns out I just had to refresh the page
00:41 - and it worked but anyway I'm sorry that
00:46 - was really late apologies for that but I
00:52 - was kind of freaking out beforehand
00:53 - because my the project wouldn't wouldn't
00:56 - run at all so I mean that was that was a
00:59 - big deal because we wouldn't really have
01:01 - much of a show if that was the case all
01:06 - right let me check I'm gonna check the
01:12 - live chat really quick because there's a
01:13 - lot in there
01:24 - okay all right so for those of you who
01:29 - haven't seen this show before I'm gonna
01:34 - do some coding and then I'm gonna answer
01:38 - some questions and then do coding and
01:40 - then answer some questions and I'll
01:41 - break it up with a timer so I'm gonna do
01:44 - a 25 minute timer which I'm going to
01:45 - start now and I think maybe I should
01:53 - move I'm gonna move the timer to one of
01:55 - my other screens and we'll just leave
02:04 - the code on this screen let me make this
02:07 - bigger so y'all can see today's
02:10 - livestream is only gonna be around an
02:13 - hour long which is pretty close to what
02:15 - our normal is but I do have to go
02:18 - somewhere shortly after that today so
02:25 - gotta make sure I don't lose track of
02:27 - time all right
02:31 - so I think that should be big enough for
02:34 - everyone to see
02:35 - just to show you what what has gone on
02:38 - and what some of the errors were I
02:40 - upgraded to next version 6
02:42 - I believe it's 6.0 1 is the official
02:47 - version so if anybody is upgrading your
02:51 - react or your next projects to 6 watch
02:54 - out for this it may not affect all of
02:56 - you but if you have a babel RC file and
03:01 - you have these presets the presets need
03:06 - to be arrays so what I had was I had
03:12 - just strings and not arrays and it would
03:15 - not start the server at all it would try
03:17 - to start and then it would exit so that
03:22 - would my issue was simply IDs just
03:26 - needed to be a race so if you're having
03:29 - some similar issues
03:30 - try putting all your values for your
03:34 - presets and your babel others RC file
03:38 - into make him erase now I'm also getting
03:42 - another error so I thought that fixed
03:44 - the problem but when I wanted to commit
03:46 - really quickly before the stream so that
03:49 - you all didn't get the same error if you
03:52 - tried to load this project but my tests
03:55 - failed and I think it's it's a similar
03:58 - issue so I didn't get to completely fix
04:01 - this before I started the stream but it
04:04 - says it couldn't find preset and
04:06 - relative to the directory users Jessie
04:10 - our projects trances can react so this
04:18 - is why I'm assuming that we we have this
04:21 - file here we have tests we have presets
04:23 - and so I'm wondering if this is also an
04:30 - issue and we're gonna try we need to
04:38 - troubleshoot this first before we move
04:40 - on otherwise I'm just gonna push this
04:43 - same error up to github and I don't want
04:47 - to do that I'd rather fix it so this is
04:49 - gonna be CSS hopefully we can fix this
04:52 - in a minute or two if I can't fix it in
04:54 - a minute - I'll just hold off and I
04:57 - won't commit anything and I'll fix it
05:00 - later and then commit all my stuff later
05:03 - but if we can fix it quickly I think
05:07 - it'll be better more rides if I never
05:17 - listen to different rate all right so
05:21 - it's looking for before there all right
05:32 - so let's see
05:37 - Oh quick
05:48 - it's
06:01 - yeah
06:16 - okay so Harshit said that he had the
06:20 - same issue all right awesome hard [ __ ]
06:24 - let me check out says check out the
06:27 - babel RC in JSA f so let's go let me
06:35 - pull over a browser window and we'll do
06:42 - this together so some of you I'm sure
06:46 - have heard me talk about this project
06:48 - before but Carson and I and Niki
06:53 - JavaScript er have been working on a
06:56 - side project called JavaScript AF so
07:01 - this is where we're gonna go right now
07:03 - to get the fix for our issue so I need
07:11 - to go into the front-end correct and if
07:17 - you check this out and github before
07:19 - check it out again and it's a lot easier
07:22 - to contribute now it's all in one repo
07:25 - the backend the front-end are no longer
07:27 - separated all right let me see the
07:40 - difference here let's get rid of that
07:43 - glad I don't have to go through that I
07:46 - wasn't looking forward to it
07:50 - okay let's copy make sure yes
08:08 - just don't copy style confinement stuff
08:11 - okay yeah I didn't yeah I didn't get the
08:14 - style component stuff so whoops
08:18 - and I need one more of those
08:23 - I believe am I good maybe I didn't need
08:28 - one more all right
08:35 - I was kind of one two three four five
08:42 - she goes here and then six go slowly up
08:46 - there seven all right yeah that should
08:50 - work okay let's start that and let's
08:56 - rerun this so I'm gonna do yarn CM and
08:59 - then I'm gonna give it the retry flag
09:02 - hopefully this will work and then we can
09:04 - get started on our CSS so if you were
09:07 - here for just the CSS stuff sorry for
09:12 - the wait it looks like it's working now
09:15 - and it's gonna happen no it still failed
09:24 - I hopefully I didn't get the same error
09:27 - as for finding invalid property of the
09:30 - fault
09:32 - yes all right did I mess it up
09:51 - mmm
09:57 - alright let me verify that this actually
10:00 - is still loading the page and if it is I
10:05 - think we'll just move on to that
10:09 - localhost let's go
10:37 - all right so if this is still loading I
10:40 - think we may just go on to the CSS okay
10:53 - all right so I'll work on that later on
10:55 - if anybody is having similar problems
10:58 - and is really interested on how we fix
11:00 - that just ask me later on and hopefully
11:07 - I'll have that fixed later today okay so
11:11 - here's the page we're gonna go to and we
11:14 - were working on this a little yesterday
11:17 - but we're gonna work on it from a
11:19 - different angle we're gonna do the CSS
11:20 - we were doing it JavaScript and data
11:24 - stuff yesterday so today we'll work on
11:28 - the CSS so this would be a good stream
11:31 - if you're kind of new maybe you're not
11:32 - that great with react or JavaScript but
11:35 - you do know CSS or you're at least
11:36 - learning it then we can see I think I
11:44 - had its didn't have education faculty I
11:48 - don't know if I have this data linked up
11:51 - we'll find out in a second if not I can
11:55 - switch to a different Department yep
12:01 - don't have it all right so let's go with
12:03 - oh I know I know who's English English
12:11 - faculty there we are
12:14 - me too okay harsh it says I need two new
12:22 - dependencies Babel core and Babel just
12:24 - wish the versions in there okay I'll
12:26 - grab those in a little bit okay so this
12:34 - is the page as it is right now it
12:38 - doesn't look great and so just a quick
12:41 - recap of how we got to this point we
12:44 - created some cards we used some pre-made
12:47 - components and then added our own stuff
12:51 - as well and then we're just pulling some
12:54 - data using graph QL
12:57 - we're pulling some data from a wordpress
12:58 - installation and we're getting a lot of
13:04 - markup and then we use some regular
13:06 - expressions to pull out the pieces of
13:08 - the markup that we wanted and this is
13:10 - what we have and we have a couple
13:12 - problems here so the big problem is we
13:16 - have these images and they're obviously
13:18 - different shapes and sizes so what we
13:21 - need to do is create a way to display
13:25 - this that will look good no matter what
13:29 - shape and size image we have okay the
13:37 - hard should I see I see you have the fix
13:40 - I just want to get do a little CSS stuff
13:42 - because I I advertise the stream as CSS
13:46 - so I don't want to get too far off right
13:50 - now maybe I'll try it a little later on
13:54 - in the stream
13:55 - I'll do the fix all right so here's what
14:02 - I'm thinking
14:04 - we can maybe actually you know what we
14:19 - had this issue before we had this issue
14:22 - on a different project let's take a look
14:24 - at a different UI we created a little
14:28 - less than than a year ago so let's go
14:33 - here to khattak addicts comm and this
14:37 - was our first project we did on the
14:39 - stream we had the same issue with really
14:43 - similar components similar similar data
14:46 - and so this is what we had we tried to
14:51 - go with a cart approach but because we
14:54 - have different size and shapes in terms
14:58 - of images it wouldn't work so we ended
15:01 - up going with these rows instead
15:04 - and also we wanted to make sure that all
15:08 - of our text was aligned properly so we
15:13 - obviously couldn't put the images on
15:14 - this side we had to move them that this
15:16 - side I think this is probably the model
15:20 - that we ought to go with so what we'll
15:24 - do is we're gonna we're gonna switch
15:27 - around the mark up a little bit to make
15:30 - it easier to apply our styles but we're
15:33 - basically gonna follow this and we may
15:37 - even come in and grab some styles that
15:40 - we used here so maybe like this little
15:42 - line here might not be a bad idea to
15:44 - just pull the Styles instead of trying
15:46 - to recreate it but unless anyone has
15:50 - objections I think this is the route
15:52 - that that we're gonna go with so since
15:56 - we already did all the work to do this
15:58 - you know what why not use that as the
16:00 - basis for what we're gonna do here it'll
16:02 - be nice and create some consistency
16:04 - between two different sites that are
16:06 - both University sites for Franciscan
16:12 - University so always good that provide a
16:16 - familiar user experience across you you
16:21 - know different sites okay so let's look
16:26 - at the actual file the mark-up for this
16:29 - to see what we need to change because I
16:32 - think this is gonna take a bit more than
16:34 - just CSS we'll have to move around some
16:39 - things in the markup so I'm gonna leave
16:40 - these pages up I'm not gonna close them
16:42 - out since we'll probably be editing them
16:44 - later on to fix our error but right now
16:49 - let's go to I thought I had these pages
16:55 - up maybe I don't
16:57 - [Music]
16:58 - faculty list that's not it I just open
17:06 - it up here no my my node modules folder
17:12 - got open
17:14 - that's the worst and you have to scroll
17:17 - for three days
17:18 - um okay where are my components that's
17:24 - what we want to be components and here's
17:26 - our new component that we've created
17:28 - just in the last few days and that's
17:30 - that list card item and if we turn this
17:35 - into a list row item we'll probably end
17:37 - up changing the name I'm just gonna
17:39 - leave it for now but here's what we'll
17:44 - do right off the bat let's check out
18:02 - no this isn't it faculty list item
18:05 - that's what it is it wasn't Lascar died
18:07 - in this faculty list items so sorry
18:11 - about that let's see okay yeah this
18:18 - looks way more familiar I was scrolling
18:20 - through that component like I don't
18:21 - remember any of this from from yesterday
18:25 - all right so we're not gonna have a card
18:29 - anymore so let's get rid of what we're
18:34 - doing here in terms of setting up a card
18:37 - and let's switch it out and for now
18:42 - let's just add divs so I'm just gonna
18:48 - select whoa didn't realize there wasn't
18:53 - oh I see what it is let's add some divs
18:58 - I need to go way up here to card and
19:01 - change this to do and let's make sure we
19:05 - do the same here we'll do do alright so
19:12 - this will be our outermost container and
19:14 - then we have some things in here like
19:16 - card actions I'm actually really
19:21 - interested to see what things look like
19:24 - if we just remove the outer card and we
19:28 - leave the other things in there oops I
19:32 - capitalized Dave I don't know what I was
19:33 - thinking and so we don't need card so
19:45 - let's just import card actions apart
19:48 - content so let's just see what it does
19:54 - we should have gotten Auto refresh it
19:57 - looks like there we are nice okay this
20:01 - is what I was hoping would happen so
20:04 - we've actually kept a lot of the styles
20:07 - here like for for the button here that's
20:10 - that's exactly what I wanted so that's
20:14 - good news
20:15 - you know one thing that we're not
20:17 - getting though that we did get before is
20:21 - we had a we had more info showing up
20:25 - let's see why we're not getting that
20:28 - info also I don't know if you notice
20:30 - this I installed we had a talk yesterday
20:33 - about how my imports are a mess and so I
20:38 - went ahead and did a setting so I
20:42 - upgraded my Visual Studio code and I
20:45 - notice there is a new setting to where
20:46 - you could if you turned it on it would
20:50 - auto organize all your imports the only
20:54 - problem is that it also adds semicolons
20:56 - which we have set for there not to be
21:01 - semicolons so I I don't know
21:05 - so my in court it seems like my imports
21:09 - can either be organized with semicolons
21:11 - or not organized without them I'm hoping
21:14 - that it'll just get Auto formatted once
21:16 - it gets committed and then it'll be okay
21:19 - all right so why are we busy are we
21:26 - missing some of this
21:39 - yeah we should we should be getting the
21:42 - title right in there and for some reason
21:52 - we're not I mean we're still getting the
21:56 - image obviously unless for some reason
21:59 - it's the font is white and I just can't
22:03 - see it would be odd but I guess it's
22:07 - worth checking
22:21 - okay it it looks like yeah we're not
22:26 - getting me yeah it should be here should
22:33 - be in this pizza we're not getting sorry
22:35 - that the dev tools font is probably
22:37 - insanely small not string that up again
22:45 - okay so here where there should be
22:47 - content there's not
23:05 - all right let's play around with this
23:07 - just for a second to see why this isn't
23:12 - coming in still nothing okay there we
23:20 - are so we got something this time why is
23:29 - there so much going on this time all
23:35 - right so now let me try to put this back
23:37 - in because this should be what we want
23:40 - basically where the title gives us an
23:46 - array of two values and we don't want to
23:51 - we want one okay
23:52 - great that works not really sure what
23:54 - was going on there but this gives us
23:56 - what we want and it gives us what we
23:58 - need to continue on with our styling so
24:00 - in terms of markup let's let's try to
24:05 - make this a little bit easier for to
24:09 - handle with our CSS so let's grab this
24:19 - div that is our image and let's throw it
24:25 - down here below our card actions it's
24:32 - this word now we want it down here so
24:38 - we're gonna throw it down below here and
24:41 - I'm gonna get rid of this we were
24:42 - keeping it to test it out but now that
24:45 - we're not gonna use a card I don't think
24:47 - we will use it that'll just clean up our
24:50 - component a bit
24:56 - we have about two more minutes before I
24:59 - do some questions from the live chat so
25:03 - hang in there if you have some questions
25:05 - and okay there we are so now we have our
25:11 - images below which in in terms of the
25:16 - flow of you know the this site is will
25:19 - obviously be a left to right site that
25:22 - makes more sense with the markup okay
25:25 - now let's get into some of the styling
25:30 - that we could do we have a few options
25:32 - we could style you know completely
25:36 - custom with CSS well we could maybe take
25:39 - advantage of some of things we have
25:44 - available to us with material you I I
25:46 - think I want to just do some regular CSS
25:49 - styles though so what we'll do is we
25:55 - will we already have some class here
26:01 - class of card on everything and did we
26:08 - did we wrap this in anything else we did
26:11 - not great but what we did do in our
26:17 - faculty list component where we're
26:20 - pulling this in oops that's our faculty
26:22 - this query let's get rid of that for now
26:24 - here's our faculty list component what
26:28 - we did was we put our all our faculty
26:35 - stuff in this masonry layout this
26:38 - masonry flat with the grid so we want to
26:42 - you know stop doing that and we'll keep
26:47 - this container
26:49 - we'll take out masonry right and then
26:55 - for our grid we can keep the grid and
27:01 - that won't really be an issue if we want
27:08 - but what we need I guess we need a grid
27:15 - container what we need to do is get rid
27:19 - of this and let's let's bring back and
27:27 - just call this but let's say that see
27:29 - what happens I think we're gonna need a
27:31 - container though for a grid also we're
27:33 - gonna get it's not gonna like that we
27:35 - took out masonry
27:47 - oh maybe it just automatically took it
27:49 - out for me awesome okay so now you see
27:54 - these all are a hundred percent of the
27:59 - width of the container so that's what we
28:02 - want it these are now rows okay so
28:05 - that's a that's a good first step next
28:11 - step after we take a little break for
28:13 - questions is going to be getting these
28:14 - images over here and getting them to be
28:17 - not quite so large once we get those
28:21 - over there then we can work on how to
28:25 - display this information and and the
28:29 - most attractive way possible so let me I
28:36 - guess I don't have to do anything on the
28:37 - screen let me go over to the chat and
28:39 - I'm gonna start up at the top I'm gonna
28:41 - scroll through look for any questions
28:43 - I'm gonna set a five-minute timer and
28:48 - we'll see how much I can get through
28:49 - five minutes and I need to make sure I
28:53 - keep an eye on the clock I have my phone
28:55 - here okay it's 11:35 my time 11:35 a.m.
29:01 - so gotta make sure I don't go really
29:06 - don't go past noon too much so so what
29:14 - as it was a feast for days asked what is
29:17 - the age of consent for CSS in the US is
29:21 - this obviously a joke but that's that's
29:23 - good one see
29:35 - so see a lot of you saying hello hey
29:38 - everybody
29:39 - we have someone I is it's aya Z if I'm
29:45 - mispronouncing that please let me know
29:46 - it says hi I'm new welcome thanks for
29:50 - watching and thanks for letting me know
29:53 - you're here in the chat is si I don't
30:00 - know something about coding okay so if
30:02 - you're beginner feel free to ask
30:04 - questions I'll do my best to answer them
30:05 - and explain what I'm doing there's a lot
30:07 - of other people in the chat that are
30:08 - very helpful lord dragon as how often
30:16 - does this happen and I'm assuming Lord
30:19 - dragons talking about the errors and
30:20 - things that were happening yeah it's I
30:25 - don't know I mean errors like that I
30:29 - mean that was pretty serious the whole
30:30 - site was like wouldn't start that's not
30:32 - that often but you know things do mess
30:35 - up so almost all these things don't go
30:40 - exactly according to plan so these these
30:43 - are I will say these are real projects
30:45 - that I'm doing for my employer so I
30:48 - don't rehearse any of this so when I
30:51 - mess up we fix it together here on the
30:56 - stream and I I mess up a lot so that's
31:00 - that's what you get here so it's not
31:01 - exactly a well planned out tutorial but
31:05 - it is an authentic glimpse into what I
31:09 - do as a my titles front-end developer
31:12 - but we do back in at times as well let's
31:20 - see alright Phoenix says the
31:26 - notification from YouTube came on time
31:28 - today which is awesome yesterday had an
31:30 - issue where Phoenix didn't get the
31:31 - notification or didn't get it till
31:33 - really late so I'm glad you got it I
31:35 - asked us how can I get started with
31:37 - coding I as I think if you go to free
31:41 - code camp org and go through some of
31:45 - those exercises that's a really easy way
31:47 - to get started
31:49 - it's easy in terms of setup you just
31:51 - need a browser and an internet
31:52 - connection and you could start there so
31:55 - if you just work your way through some
31:58 - of those challenges and free code camp
32:01 - and then their lessons I think that'll
32:05 - give you an idea for you know maybe do
32:07 - you like it this is something you want
32:09 - to pursue further and then you know you
32:11 - can keep going further on and progress
32:13 - like that yeah John says another bit of
32:21 - advice to new people put your seat belt
32:23 - on it's a ride a knowledge ride I like
32:26 - that one
32:38 - uh JJ solo says looks like a hacker and
32:43 - not a web coder haha I didn't realize it
32:47 - looked like a hacker so I don't know if
32:50 - that's a compliment or not but let's
32:53 - take it as a compliment so evidently I
32:55 - look like a really awesome hacker
33:12 - Christian asks what is the difference
33:14 - between material UI and bootstrap yet so
33:19 - hardship gives an answer here material
33:21 - UI is based on Google's material design
33:23 - framework and material UI also is
33:26 - designed to work in with react
33:28 - components so bootstrap on the other
33:32 - hand is its own as don't style and it's
33:36 - also designed to work on almost say like
33:42 - let's say sites websites that don't have
33:45 - a particular JavaScript framework it or
33:48 - library like angular react to you so a
33:51 - bootstrap is easier to use for just a
33:53 - plain JavaScript HTML CSS site although
33:57 - I do believe there are versions out
34:00 - there that can be used with things like
34:03 - angular and react alright so I didn't
34:10 - get to all the questions but I will
34:12 - after our next session is over or I will
34:18 - at least try to get to everything right
34:19 - now I just started another 25-minute
34:21 - Pomodoro session we're gonna get back to
34:23 - the code and let's see oh did you all
34:32 - y'all heard the alarm from oh I forgot
34:34 - my my laptop speakers must still be on
34:40 - and my headphones which are normally in
34:43 - my laptop or in my phone so that I don't
34:45 - waste any computing power on running
34:49 - Spotify alright so our next step then is
34:56 - to display this on this side over here
34:59 - so let's just do a little bit of work
35:01 - right here in dev tools so I think it's
35:04 - it's always very useful to do working
35:07 - dev tools by the way if you haven't
35:10 - already done so it might not be a bad
35:11 - idea to check out the the latest in
35:17 - what's available in dev tools so at one
35:20 - of the sessions at the Google i/o
35:22 - conference they did a
35:25 - on the new stuff in in dev tools so you
35:31 - that's on the Google Developers YouTube
35:34 - channel so check that out definitely
35:37 - worthwhile a lot of cool tools so I'm
35:42 - still not familiar enough with them to
35:44 - use them yet but I think I might need to
35:46 - watch the talk again in practice but
35:50 - definitely some good stuff so let's see
35:52 - what we can do here and here's what I'm
35:57 - gonna try first
35:58 - let's give let's let's try using a bit
36:01 - of flexbox here okay unfortunately well
36:05 - are we already using flex nice
36:11 - let's give it a display flex okay and
36:17 - then let's set my on the top oops I
36:25 - don't want to be I'm one step up from
36:30 - where I want to be I actually want to be
36:31 - down here so we'll give this a display
36:34 - flex hey already looking like a little
36:41 - better here so we'll give this a display
36:43 - flex and let's see okay so by default
36:59 - let's see flex direction
37:07 - let's just go these are the options we
37:09 - have we could do a column which is what
37:11 - we had before we don't want call them
37:13 - reverse which flips the site flips the
37:20 - content and then we could GU row or row
37:24 - reverse so we want row which we'd
37:27 - defaulted to anyway so we're gonna go
37:29 - with that but that just gives you an
37:34 - idea of your options and let's see just
37:37 - justified content here's some some other
37:40 - options we can go with so you can see we
37:42 - can Center our content and flex it so
37:45 - it's it's not actually that great to use
37:50 - right now because there's not a whole
37:52 - lot of space right but what what I would
37:57 - like to do is set things to the left
38:01 - okay there'll be a line left and then
38:05 - let's go down to this and for this one
38:10 - let's say justify self and we'll go
38:16 - rights that should have done that maybe
38:21 - there's just not enough space not yeah
38:23 - it should have adjusted interesting
38:35 - I got a I shouldn't have to do this yeah
38:45 - i what am I doing wrong just fat content
38:50 - okay
39:02 - the first two times inside the same diff
39:06 - okay so John's saying the first two need
39:09 - to be inside the same div all right so
39:12 - that's messing things up alright let's
39:15 - go ahead and adjust the mark-up a bit so
39:19 - that we can get a better result and then
39:23 - also let's do the the mark-up first so
39:30 - down here within our faculty list item
39:33 - component which now or is gonna be a row
39:41 - basically we need to say have our card
39:54 - actions and our card content in the same
39:58 - div so let's just create a div here and
40:07 - class name equals classes that's Louis
40:25 - we'll call it text content and that'll
40:29 - give us something to use as a class here
40:31 - and when we need it down here yeah this
40:41 - is where we need our end all right
40:46 - is that it let's see
40:56 - I think so alright let's go back over
41:00 - here we can see already this is aligning
41:04 - much more nicely for us so now we only
41:08 - have two kind of sub groupings here
41:14 - within our list actually what's this
41:18 - happen there we are there's the div um
41:24 - I'm looking at so within this div we
41:29 - only have two sections two divs now
41:31 - better direct children and that's better
41:34 - that's what we want so let's go back to
41:38 - here to this one and so if you hear the
41:44 - vibrating noise I'm getting a phone call
41:45 - but I don't know who it is I'm not gonna
41:47 - answer it so what I want to do justify
41:53 - self and I wanted to see if that would
41:57 - work it looks like it's still not
41:58 - working so it looks like John had some
42:01 - other things see what he said between Oh
42:14 - excellent
42:15 - John you are awesome so we can use this
42:19 - justify content space between to
42:22 - basically get the the effect we want so
42:25 - let's take what we've done here and
42:27 - apply it in our actual project and let's
42:33 - let's see how it looks on all of these
42:36 - next step after that we'll be tackling
42:38 - you know these images we need to make a
42:41 - the maximum height to the images the
42:44 - width is gonna be okay and as long as
42:48 - it's not outrageous you know any width
42:50 - will do but we do need a maximum height
42:53 - so let's go ahead and do that I think
42:56 - the way let's see display for X [ __ ]
42:59 - sticks are just like content space
43:00 - between okay I can remember that so what
43:05 - did we name this outer div I believe
43:10 - our classes card yeah which we had yes
43:21 - with 100% on so now with our with 100%
43:26 - we're gonna add this now I do have to
43:30 - say this is gonna look a little bit
43:31 - different than normal CSS so I had
43:33 - anticipated we would be using a regular
43:35 - stylesheet but after looking at the
43:37 - markup and working with it I think this
43:39 - will be the better way to go so this is
43:41 - actually using CSS as JavaScript
43:47 - essentially this is JavaScript object
43:49 - but in terms of what we call things and
43:52 - the values we give them it's gonna be
43:54 - pretty much the same as normal CSS so
43:57 - let's go with display flex and we had
44:07 - what was it I already forgot it I
44:10 - thought I could remember it Oh flex
44:11 - direction Rho which we don't need
44:14 - because it's gonna be there by default
44:16 - so let's leave that out and then we need
44:18 - justify content C and we're gonna camel
44:24 - case because we're in JavaScript land
44:26 - right now and in hyphens mean minus
44:30 - signs and we're gonna do the space
44:32 - between we can leave the hyphen in but
44:37 - in this case because we put it in single
44:40 - quotes which makes it a string in so
44:42 - that's okay all right so we have that
44:44 - and then if you remember we made another
44:47 - div and we called that it was text
44:53 - content right so we're gonna say for our
44:57 - text content actually do we need to do
45:00 - anything with that no we don't and we
45:08 - don't need that okay great so we
45:10 - actually don't need this which is
45:14 - wonderful
45:15 - less whoops I got rid of the comma that
45:18 - I needed let's save that and then I'm
45:20 - gonna do a hard refresh or just a
45:23 - fresh and that'll just get rid of
45:25 - anything that we had left over here in
45:27 - chrome so that it doesn't interfere and
45:29 - we know for sure that this is our stuff
45:32 - that we put in our project and not our
45:34 - test stuff in chrome and nice one thing
45:41 - I don't understand that why this is
45:43 - happening but we keep getting alternate
45:46 - order for this data so I think maybe at
45:52 - the later time what I'm gonna have to
45:55 - address that but not bad not bad so
46:04 - let's let's shrink these down let's at
46:07 - least see what what the height is for
46:10 - these looks like 300 pixels so let's see
46:15 - if we put a max height on these images
46:21 - let's see what we get so once again
46:24 - we'll do it in dev tools first we may
46:27 - even be able to do it on the detail
46:29 - image you let's let's do that since we
46:31 - can grab it from from the tag name and
46:39 - apply it everywhere and let's set max
46:41 - height 300 pixels whoa let's get our
46:56 - image here
47:10 - alright let's try it again let's put our
47:17 - 300 pixels here okay much better much
47:21 - much better okay so it's it's still not
47:25 - gonna be the most visually appealing
47:27 - thing so at some point it might be nice
47:30 - to go in and what we would need really
47:33 - is to look up or in our photo archive if
47:35 - we actually have photos that are more
47:38 - like this for these professors and then
47:42 - if we don't we'll need to get our
47:45 - photographers to set up appointments
47:48 - with these professors to take you know
47:50 - professional photo that would give us
47:53 - what we need for kind of for
47:54 - Standardization of the site but doing it
47:58 - this way does allow us to have various
48:01 - sizes of images and it doesn't throw off
48:05 - our entire layout so I think we're gonna
48:10 - go with this for now the only thing I'd
48:12 - like to add is that kind of horizontal
48:14 - line in here so we'll do that and then
48:20 - once again we've lost the we've lost
48:25 - some of our data so yeah that's that's a
48:30 - problem for later on
48:31 - I'm not going to tackle that during this
48:33 - stream okay so let's add this style up
48:40 - now into our component so we're gonna go
48:44 - down here Oh actually no we're getting
48:48 - we're gonna need to add some CSS in here
48:51 - into a CSS file so what we'll do it
48:57 - we'll do it in here
48:59 - so in our faculty list component I
49:03 - believe we're already bringing in styles
49:06 - here's our Styles so let's make a CSS
49:10 - page this faculty list okay yeah so what
49:19 - we want
49:21 - actually let's let's do it like this I
49:23 - want to keep whatever styles we have in
49:25 - faculty and then I want to see if we can
49:28 - bring in another style sheet and we'll
49:33 - call that faculty list and this is gonna
49:37 - seem like overkill right now but we'll
49:39 - probably end up adding styles to this so
49:42 - don't don't worry about it and if it
49:47 - does end up being overkill dev - style
49:49 - sheets will we can refactor hmm sorry
49:56 - about the yawn alright so we need to
49:59 - actually create this so we're gonna go
50:01 - into our static styles and we're gonna
50:05 - add another page and we're gonna still
50:08 - call this faculty list dot CSS and now
50:16 - see it's open and we're gonna we're
50:18 - gonna say in our faculty list dot CSS
50:21 - anything that's in this detail oops and
50:27 - what's what is a detailed view image
50:31 - element and it's an image we're gonna
50:38 - MIT set it at a max height of 300 pixels
50:47 - and let's save that we'll see see what
50:53 - happens here let's give it a refresh to
50:55 - get rid of what we've just done here all
51:01 - right wonderful so that's been pooled in
51:03 - oh and for a second we actually had the
51:07 - data that we wanted and what happened
51:09 - what happens happening weird and in this
51:14 - component so at least we have hmm there
51:23 - were images looking better better than
51:28 - they were and you can see this CSS has
51:32 - now successfully been imported
51:35 - here and if we we look we can see in dev
51:40 - tools that it's pulling that from
51:42 - faculty list dot CSS see we can see it's
51:45 - right here and we still as well have our
51:55 - other other styles being applied that
52:02 - were already there as well as our Styles
52:05 - here and then any inline styles that we
52:09 - may want to use those are applied as
52:11 - well so we have a lot of different
52:12 - levels of styles going on okay Harshit
52:17 - said check the console which is a great
52:19 - idea to see what what may be going on
52:21 - here did not match okay it says warning
52:29 - prop dangerously set enter HTML did not
52:32 - match server client interesting so it
52:42 - looks like that is why I'm getting this
53:08 - I said I
53:26 - yeah all right so something's wrong with
53:29 - the way I'm pulling in this title
53:31 - content so it looks like it's pulling it
53:35 - in initially but then it's taking it out
53:37 - because it's not matching what we'll
53:42 - divers on the server so anyway we'll
53:45 - we'll tackle that let me check how much
53:47 - time we have in this comodoro session
53:50 - okay about only about five more minutes
53:52 - so basically at this point I'm just
53:55 - gonna go I'm gonna do some more
53:57 - questions because I need to end the
53:59 - stream in a few minutes anyway so if I
54:02 - were getting all the data here that I
54:04 - would like to have then we may do a bit
54:08 - more styling just to make sure
54:09 - everything lines up and we would add
54:10 - that horizontal in here but basically
54:12 - it's gonna end up looking somewhat like
54:16 - this which I think will look pretty nice
54:21 - the only adjustment to make them may be
54:23 - made is like right now compared to the
54:26 - text the images are quite large you
54:28 - might not be a bad idea to maybe shrink
54:30 - these and do max height of maybe 250
54:33 - pixels that way more faculty members can
54:35 - be displayed at once you know you could
54:39 - see them on one screen there wouldn't be
54:41 - the oldest space here so that I mean
54:44 - there there are some things that
54:45 - definitely could be done to improve it
54:48 - so right now I need to hurry through the
54:55 - rest of this live chat so normally I
54:57 - like to take my time and answer all the
54:59 - questions but unfortunately today I
55:01 - cannot and I actually completely forgot
55:05 - I had somewhere to go until I already
55:09 - started the stream and then I I got a
55:12 - message on my phone that I had that I
55:17 - had an employment and I panicked for a
55:21 - second and thought when is it when is it
55:23 - and but I I still had time to stream
55:26 - just a quick one all right I'm trying to
55:29 - figure out where I left off in the chat
55:36 - okay the Stevens here Steven says hey
55:39 - hey how's it going
55:43 - deepak says thank you so much for
55:45 - sharing your time with us all you're
55:47 - welcome well I mean that you all are
55:50 - sharing your time as well so I
55:52 - appreciate that
55:54 - appreciate you all watching in and
55:56 - helping me so don't this is definitely
56:01 - not a one-sided thing here
56:12 - well Michael said why not set max height
56:15 - of road of to 300 to scale everything
56:17 - down yeah I guess I could have tried
56:19 - that although when we tried to set the
56:21 - container did for this image down to 300
56:24 - the image is just kind of bled out
56:25 - anyway so anyway I mean this this works
56:30 - as it is I suppose but but had I seen
56:35 - that message earlier I probably would
56:36 - have tried it oh and then John said the
56:42 - same thing set it on the outer div group
56:47 - and let me try to pronounce this it's
56:50 - gee you are you Raj guru rush I'm gonna
56:56 - say guru Raj let me know if that's not
56:59 - how to pronounce it says please make
57:00 - shopping cart app with angular 6 and
57:02 - nodejs and latest material design I
57:06 - haven't worked with angular for a long
57:10 - long time let alone angular 6 so I don't
57:12 - think I'll be making that anytime soon
57:16 - so if anybody else has anything like
57:18 - that they're working on with egular
57:23 - please let us know
57:37 - see
57:55 - Michael creo says dr. John Homs yes we
58:00 - have a dr. John homes or homes or
58:08 - whatever you want to pronounce it I
58:09 - don't know
58:26 - okay Michael good thinking on that
58:29 - michael says the faculty right now are
58:32 - being brought in by their faculty ID and
58:34 - so that's how they're ordered but they
58:36 - should be ordered by last name
58:38 - alphabetically so we will do that
58:41 - actually I need to check what the
58:43 - current order is on the main website
58:45 - that's that's live the one that will be
58:47 - replaced and see if they actually are an
58:52 - alphabetic order there or if there's a
58:54 - different order I hope itself abetik oh
58:56 - I don't want to do a custom order for
58:57 - everyone all right looks like there's
59:00 - two more questions and then I have to be
59:03 - finished Matthew says what do you
59:07 - recommend if my job discourages asking
59:10 - for any mentorship in my programming
59:12 - skills I hear that it's really key to
59:17 - help help me grow but my boss wants me
59:20 - to be a 100% independent what do I do
59:27 - I would say that the best thing that you
59:30 - could do maybe is find information that
59:33 - shows how much mentoring will help you
59:37 - and really how being 100% independent
59:41 - will make you less productive because I
59:43 - definitely believe it will so I don't
59:45 - offhand know of any studies or
59:47 - information that I can point you to but
59:49 - I'm sure it's out there so I would maybe
59:51 - find that share that with your boss I
59:55 - mean you you know your boss better than
59:57 - I do of course so I don't know the best
60:00 - way to approach him with that
60:01 - information you may not want to just
60:04 - confront him with it maybe you wanted to
60:05 - slip in little comments here and there
60:07 - to warm him up I don't really know but
60:10 - you know you you want to show your boss
60:15 - how this will make you a better employee
60:17 - because that's probably what he's
60:19 - worried about you know and then if you
60:21 - can convince him of that then he should
60:25 - be okay with with mentorship and if he
60:32 - isn't still okay with it then then come
60:35 - ask me and we can think about a strategy
60:39 - for the next
60:42 - Phoenix says hey Jesse just an update on
60:44 - my 30 days 30 sites it's going good but
60:47 - it looks like I am doing 30 days 30
60:50 - landing pages ha ha hey well it's it's
60:55 - still coding still coding every day
61:03 - okay that's CSS file you created was
61:06 - there a period in front of that class
61:08 - attribute and in from the image or I
61:10 - don't understand that
61:11 - where was it thoughtfully CSS no no
61:16 - period because the actual name of the
61:18 - elements is detailed view image right so
61:23 - we can see here the detailed view image
61:26 - so we're not targeting a class we're
61:29 - targeting in elements so I mean this
61:32 - technically is completely okay I believe
61:35 - in html5 it became okay
61:38 - don't I'm not sure that that's exactly
61:41 - when but so this wouldn't pass like I
61:46 - don't know what are those HTML
61:48 - certification things you know depending
61:50 - on your version but browsers browsers
61:54 - can handle this but then we go to use it
61:57 - with CSS we need to treat it just like
61:59 - we would let say a div where we wouldn't
62:02 - put a period in front of the div so
62:03 - hopefully that that answers your
62:07 - question hopefully I'm understanding it
62:08 - correctly okay thank you so much for
62:15 - joining me thank you for putting up with
62:16 - my lateness at the beginning and the
62:18 - errors that I had to deal with and I
62:21 - died for sure have to go right now if I
62:24 - make it to my appointment on time I had
62:26 - a great time and a great week with you
62:30 - all and I can't wait to come back next
62:32 - week and start streaming again so until
62:35 - then have a wonderful weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and I apologize for being 7 minutes late I I had so many things happen all at once right when I was going to start so really sorry it got a couple emails from work and had to respond to those and I've I'm getting errors when I try to commit and when I tried to start the stream the button to start the stream was was like grayed out and I I couldn't get it to start it turns out I just had to refresh the page and it worked but anyway I'm sorry that was really late apologies for that but I was kind of freaking out beforehand because my the project wouldn't wouldn't run at all so I mean that was that was a big deal because we wouldn't really have much of a show if that was the case all right let me check I'm gonna check the live chat really quick because there's a lot in there okay all right so for those of you who haven't seen this show before I'm gonna do some coding and then I'm gonna answer some questions and then do coding and then answer some questions and I'll break it up with a timer so I'm gonna do a 25 minute timer which I'm going to start now and I think maybe I should move I'm gonna move the timer to one of my other screens and we'll just leave the code on this screen let me make this bigger so y'all can see today's livestream is only gonna be around an hour long which is pretty close to what our normal is but I do have to go somewhere shortly after that today so gotta make sure I don't lose track of time all right so I think that should be big enough for everyone to see just to show you what what has gone on and what some of the errors were I upgraded to next version 6 I believe it's 6.0 1 is the official version so if anybody is upgrading your react or your next projects to 6 watch out for this it may not affect all of you but if you have a babel RC file and you have these presets the presets need to be arrays so what I had was I had just strings and not arrays and it would not start the server at all it would try to start and then it would exit so that would my issue was simply IDs just needed to be a race so if you're having some similar issues try putting all your values for your presets and your babel others RC file into make him erase now I'm also getting another error so I thought that fixed the problem but when I wanted to commit really quickly before the stream so that you all didn't get the same error if you tried to load this project but my tests failed and I think it's it's a similar issue so I didn't get to completely fix this before I started the stream but it says it couldn't find preset and relative to the directory users Jessie our projects trances can react so this is why I'm assuming that we we have this file here we have tests we have presets and so I'm wondering if this is also an issue and we're gonna try we need to troubleshoot this first before we move on otherwise I'm just gonna push this same error up to github and I don't want to do that I'd rather fix it so this is gonna be CSS hopefully we can fix this in a minute or two if I can't fix it in a minute I'll just hold off and I won't commit anything and I'll fix it later and then commit all my stuff later but if we can fix it quickly I think it'll be better more rides if I never listen to different rate all right so it's looking for before there all right so let's see Oh quick it's yeah okay so Harshit said that he had the same issue all right awesome hard [ __ ] let me check out says check out the babel RC in JSA f so let's go let me pull over a browser window and we'll do this together so some of you I'm sure have heard me talk about this project before but Carson and I and Niki JavaScript er have been working on a side project called JavaScript AF so this is where we're gonna go right now to get the fix for our issue so I need to go into the frontend correct and if you check this out and github before check it out again and it's a lot easier to contribute now it's all in one repo the backend the frontend are no longer separated all right let me see the difference here let's get rid of that glad I don't have to go through that I wasn't looking forward to it okay let's copy make sure yes just don't copy style confinement stuff okay yeah I didn't yeah I didn't get the style component stuff so whoops and I need one more of those I believe am I good maybe I didn't need one more all right I was kind of one two three four five she goes here and then six go slowly up there seven all right yeah that should work okay let's start that and let's rerun this so I'm gonna do yarn CM and then I'm gonna give it the retry flag hopefully this will work and then we can get started on our CSS so if you were here for just the CSS stuff sorry for the wait it looks like it's working now and it's gonna happen no it still failed I hopefully I didn't get the same error as for finding invalid property of the fault yes all right did I mess it up mmm alright let me verify that this actually is still loading the page and if it is I think we'll just move on to that localhost let's go all right so if this is still loading I think we may just go on to the CSS okay all right so I'll work on that later on if anybody is having similar problems and is really interested on how we fix that just ask me later on and hopefully I'll have that fixed later today okay so here's the page we're gonna go to and we were working on this a little yesterday but we're gonna work on it from a different angle we're gonna do the CSS we were doing it JavaScript and data stuff yesterday so today we'll work on the CSS so this would be a good stream if you're kind of new maybe you're not that great with react or JavaScript but you do know CSS or you're at least learning it then we can see I think I had its didn't have education faculty I don't know if I have this data linked up we'll find out in a second if not I can switch to a different Department yep don't have it all right so let's go with oh I know I know who's English English faculty there we are me too okay harsh it says I need two new dependencies Babel core and Babel just wish the versions in there okay I'll grab those in a little bit okay so this is the page as it is right now it doesn't look great and so just a quick recap of how we got to this point we created some cards we used some premade components and then added our own stuff as well and then we're just pulling some data using graph QL we're pulling some data from a wordpress installation and we're getting a lot of markup and then we use some regular expressions to pull out the pieces of the markup that we wanted and this is what we have and we have a couple problems here so the big problem is we have these images and they're obviously different shapes and sizes so what we need to do is create a way to display this that will look good no matter what shape and size image we have okay the hard should I see I see you have the fix I just want to get do a little CSS stuff because I I advertise the stream as CSS so I don't want to get too far off right now maybe I'll try it a little later on in the stream I'll do the fix all right so here's what I'm thinking we can maybe actually you know what we had this issue before we had this issue on a different project let's take a look at a different UI we created a little less than than a year ago so let's go here to khattak addicts comm and this was our first project we did on the stream we had the same issue with really similar components similar similar data and so this is what we had we tried to go with a cart approach but because we have different size and shapes in terms of images it wouldn't work so we ended up going with these rows instead and also we wanted to make sure that all of our text was aligned properly so we obviously couldn't put the images on this side we had to move them that this side I think this is probably the model that we ought to go with so what we'll do is we're gonna we're gonna switch around the mark up a little bit to make it easier to apply our styles but we're basically gonna follow this and we may even come in and grab some styles that we used here so maybe like this little line here might not be a bad idea to just pull the Styles instead of trying to recreate it but unless anyone has objections I think this is the route that that we're gonna go with so since we already did all the work to do this you know what why not use that as the basis for what we're gonna do here it'll be nice and create some consistency between two different sites that are both University sites for Franciscan University so always good that provide a familiar user experience across you you know different sites okay so let's look at the actual file the markup for this to see what we need to change because I think this is gonna take a bit more than just CSS we'll have to move around some things in the markup so I'm gonna leave these pages up I'm not gonna close them out since we'll probably be editing them later on to fix our error but right now let's go to I thought I had these pages up maybe I don't faculty list that's not it I just open it up here no my my node modules folder got open that's the worst and you have to scroll for three days um okay where are my components that's what we want to be components and here's our new component that we've created just in the last few days and that's that list card item and if we turn this into a list row item we'll probably end up changing the name I'm just gonna leave it for now but here's what we'll do right off the bat let's check out no this isn't it faculty list item that's what it is it wasn't Lascar died in this faculty list items so sorry about that let's see okay yeah this looks way more familiar I was scrolling through that component like I don't remember any of this from from yesterday all right so we're not gonna have a card anymore so let's get rid of what we're doing here in terms of setting up a card and let's switch it out and for now let's just add divs so I'm just gonna select whoa didn't realize there wasn't oh I see what it is let's add some divs I need to go way up here to card and change this to do and let's make sure we do the same here we'll do do alright so this will be our outermost container and then we have some things in here like card actions I'm actually really interested to see what things look like if we just remove the outer card and we leave the other things in there oops I capitalized Dave I don't know what I was thinking and so we don't need card so let's just import card actions apart content so let's just see what it does we should have gotten Auto refresh it looks like there we are nice okay this is what I was hoping would happen so we've actually kept a lot of the styles here like for for the button here that's that's exactly what I wanted so that's good news you know one thing that we're not getting though that we did get before is we had a we had more info showing up let's see why we're not getting that info also I don't know if you notice this I installed we had a talk yesterday about how my imports are a mess and so I went ahead and did a setting so I upgraded my Visual Studio code and I notice there is a new setting to where you could if you turned it on it would auto organize all your imports the only problem is that it also adds semicolons which we have set for there not to be semicolons so I I don't know so my in court it seems like my imports can either be organized with semicolons or not organized without them I'm hoping that it'll just get Auto formatted once it gets committed and then it'll be okay all right so why are we busy are we missing some of this yeah we should we should be getting the title right in there and for some reason we're not I mean we're still getting the image obviously unless for some reason it's the font is white and I just can't see it would be odd but I guess it's worth checking okay it it looks like yeah we're not getting me yeah it should be here should be in this pizza we're not getting sorry that the dev tools font is probably insanely small not string that up again okay so here where there should be content there's not all right let's play around with this just for a second to see why this isn't coming in still nothing okay there we are so we got something this time why is there so much going on this time all right so now let me try to put this back in because this should be what we want basically where the title gives us an array of two values and we don't want to we want one okay great that works not really sure what was going on there but this gives us what we want and it gives us what we need to continue on with our styling so in terms of markup let's let's try to make this a little bit easier for to handle with our CSS so let's grab this div that is our image and let's throw it down here below our card actions it's this word now we want it down here so we're gonna throw it down below here and I'm gonna get rid of this we were keeping it to test it out but now that we're not gonna use a card I don't think we will use it that'll just clean up our component a bit we have about two more minutes before I do some questions from the live chat so hang in there if you have some questions and okay there we are so now we have our images below which in in terms of the flow of you know the this site is will obviously be a left to right site that makes more sense with the markup okay now let's get into some of the styling that we could do we have a few options we could style you know completely custom with CSS well we could maybe take advantage of some of things we have available to us with material you I I think I want to just do some regular CSS styles though so what we'll do is we will we already have some class here class of card on everything and did we did we wrap this in anything else we did not great but what we did do in our faculty list component where we're pulling this in oops that's our faculty this query let's get rid of that for now here's our faculty list component what we did was we put our all our faculty stuff in this masonry layout this masonry flat with the grid so we want to you know stop doing that and we'll keep this container we'll take out masonry right and then for our grid we can keep the grid and that won't really be an issue if we want but what we need I guess we need a grid container what we need to do is get rid of this and let's let's bring back and just call this but let's say that see what happens I think we're gonna need a container though for a grid also we're gonna get it's not gonna like that we took out masonry oh maybe it just automatically took it out for me awesome okay so now you see these all are a hundred percent of the width of the container so that's what we want it these are now rows okay so that's a that's a good first step next step after we take a little break for questions is going to be getting these images over here and getting them to be not quite so large once we get those over there then we can work on how to display this information and and the most attractive way possible so let me I guess I don't have to do anything on the screen let me go over to the chat and I'm gonna start up at the top I'm gonna scroll through look for any questions I'm gonna set a fiveminute timer and we'll see how much I can get through five minutes and I need to make sure I keep an eye on the clock I have my phone here okay it's 1135 my time 1135 a.m. so gotta make sure I don't go really don't go past noon too much so so what as it was a feast for days asked what is the age of consent for CSS in the US is this obviously a joke but that's that's good one see so see a lot of you saying hello hey everybody we have someone I is it's aya Z if I'm mispronouncing that please let me know it says hi I'm new welcome thanks for watching and thanks for letting me know you're here in the chat is si I don't know something about coding okay so if you're beginner feel free to ask questions I'll do my best to answer them and explain what I'm doing there's a lot of other people in the chat that are very helpful lord dragon as how often does this happen and I'm assuming Lord dragons talking about the errors and things that were happening yeah it's I don't know I mean errors like that I mean that was pretty serious the whole site was like wouldn't start that's not that often but you know things do mess up so almost all these things don't go exactly according to plan so these these are I will say these are real projects that I'm doing for my employer so I don't rehearse any of this so when I mess up we fix it together here on the stream and I I mess up a lot so that's that's what you get here so it's not exactly a well planned out tutorial but it is an authentic glimpse into what I do as a my titles frontend developer but we do back in at times as well let's see alright Phoenix says the notification from YouTube came on time today which is awesome yesterday had an issue where Phoenix didn't get the notification or didn't get it till really late so I'm glad you got it I asked us how can I get started with coding I as I think if you go to free code camp org and go through some of those exercises that's a really easy way to get started it's easy in terms of setup you just need a browser and an internet connection and you could start there so if you just work your way through some of those challenges and free code camp and then their lessons I think that'll give you an idea for you know maybe do you like it this is something you want to pursue further and then you know you can keep going further on and progress like that yeah John says another bit of advice to new people put your seat belt on it's a ride a knowledge ride I like that one uh JJ solo says looks like a hacker and not a web coder haha I didn't realize it looked like a hacker so I don't know if that's a compliment or not but let's take it as a compliment so evidently I look like a really awesome hacker Christian asks what is the difference between material UI and bootstrap yet so hardship gives an answer here material UI is based on Google's material design framework and material UI also is designed to work in with react components so bootstrap on the other hand is its own as don't style and it's also designed to work on almost say like let's say sites websites that don't have a particular JavaScript framework it or library like angular react to you so a bootstrap is easier to use for just a plain JavaScript HTML CSS site although I do believe there are versions out there that can be used with things like angular and react alright so I didn't get to all the questions but I will after our next session is over or I will at least try to get to everything right now I just started another 25minute Pomodoro session we're gonna get back to the code and let's see oh did you all y'all heard the alarm from oh I forgot my my laptop speakers must still be on and my headphones which are normally in my laptop or in my phone so that I don't waste any computing power on running Spotify alright so our next step then is to display this on this side over here so let's just do a little bit of work right here in dev tools so I think it's it's always very useful to do working dev tools by the way if you haven't already done so it might not be a bad idea to check out the the latest in what's available in dev tools so at one of the sessions at the Google i/o conference they did a on the new stuff in in dev tools so you that's on the Google Developers YouTube channel so check that out definitely worthwhile a lot of cool tools so I'm still not familiar enough with them to use them yet but I think I might need to watch the talk again in practice but definitely some good stuff so let's see what we can do here and here's what I'm gonna try first let's give let's let's try using a bit of flexbox here okay unfortunately well are we already using flex nice let's give it a display flex okay and then let's set my on the top oops I don't want to be I'm one step up from where I want to be I actually want to be down here so we'll give this a display flex hey already looking like a little better here so we'll give this a display flex and let's see okay so by default let's see flex direction let's just go these are the options we have we could do a column which is what we had before we don't want call them reverse which flips the site flips the content and then we could GU row or row reverse so we want row which we'd defaulted to anyway so we're gonna go with that but that just gives you an idea of your options and let's see just justified content here's some some other options we can go with so you can see we can Center our content and flex it so it's it's not actually that great to use right now because there's not a whole lot of space right but what what I would like to do is set things to the left okay there'll be a line left and then let's go down to this and for this one let's say justify self and we'll go rights that should have done that maybe there's just not enough space not yeah it should have adjusted interesting I got a I shouldn't have to do this yeah i what am I doing wrong just fat content okay the first two times inside the same diff okay so John's saying the first two need to be inside the same div all right so that's messing things up alright let's go ahead and adjust the markup a bit so that we can get a better result and then also let's do the the markup first so down here within our faculty list item component which now or is gonna be a row basically we need to say have our card actions and our card content in the same div so let's just create a div here and class name equals classes that's Louis we'll call it text content and that'll give us something to use as a class here and when we need it down here yeah this is where we need our end all right is that it let's see I think so alright let's go back over here we can see already this is aligning much more nicely for us so now we only have two kind of sub groupings here within our list actually what's this happen there we are there's the div um I'm looking at so within this div we only have two sections two divs now better direct children and that's better that's what we want so let's go back to here to this one and so if you hear the vibrating noise I'm getting a phone call but I don't know who it is I'm not gonna answer it so what I want to do justify self and I wanted to see if that would work it looks like it's still not working so it looks like John had some other things see what he said between Oh excellent John you are awesome so we can use this justify content space between to basically get the the effect we want so let's take what we've done here and apply it in our actual project and let's let's see how it looks on all of these next step after that we'll be tackling you know these images we need to make a the maximum height to the images the width is gonna be okay and as long as it's not outrageous you know any width will do but we do need a maximum height so let's go ahead and do that I think the way let's see display for X [ __ ] sticks are just like content space between okay I can remember that so what did we name this outer div I believe our classes card yeah which we had yes with 100% on so now with our with 100% we're gonna add this now I do have to say this is gonna look a little bit different than normal CSS so I had anticipated we would be using a regular stylesheet but after looking at the markup and working with it I think this will be the better way to go so this is actually using CSS as JavaScript essentially this is JavaScript object but in terms of what we call things and the values we give them it's gonna be pretty much the same as normal CSS so let's go with display flex and we had what was it I already forgot it I thought I could remember it Oh flex direction Rho which we don't need because it's gonna be there by default so let's leave that out and then we need justify content C and we're gonna camel case because we're in JavaScript land right now and in hyphens mean minus signs and we're gonna do the space between we can leave the hyphen in but in this case because we put it in single quotes which makes it a string in so that's okay all right so we have that and then if you remember we made another div and we called that it was text content right so we're gonna say for our text content actually do we need to do anything with that no we don't and we don't need that okay great so we actually don't need this which is wonderful less whoops I got rid of the comma that I needed let's save that and then I'm gonna do a hard refresh or just a fresh and that'll just get rid of anything that we had left over here in chrome so that it doesn't interfere and we know for sure that this is our stuff that we put in our project and not our test stuff in chrome and nice one thing I don't understand that why this is happening but we keep getting alternate order for this data so I think maybe at the later time what I'm gonna have to address that but not bad not bad so let's let's shrink these down let's at least see what what the height is for these looks like 300 pixels so let's see if we put a max height on these images let's see what we get so once again we'll do it in dev tools first we may even be able to do it on the detail image you let's let's do that since we can grab it from from the tag name and apply it everywhere and let's set max height 300 pixels whoa let's get our image here alright let's try it again let's put our 300 pixels here okay much better much much better okay so it's it's still not gonna be the most visually appealing thing so at some point it might be nice to go in and what we would need really is to look up or in our photo archive if we actually have photos that are more like this for these professors and then if we don't we'll need to get our photographers to set up appointments with these professors to take you know professional photo that would give us what we need for kind of for Standardization of the site but doing it this way does allow us to have various sizes of images and it doesn't throw off our entire layout so I think we're gonna go with this for now the only thing I'd like to add is that kind of horizontal line in here so we'll do that and then once again we've lost the we've lost some of our data so yeah that's that's a problem for later on I'm not going to tackle that during this stream okay so let's add this style up now into our component so we're gonna go down here Oh actually no we're getting we're gonna need to add some CSS in here into a CSS file so what we'll do it we'll do it in here so in our faculty list component I believe we're already bringing in styles here's our Styles so let's make a CSS page this faculty list okay yeah so what we want actually let's let's do it like this I want to keep whatever styles we have in faculty and then I want to see if we can bring in another style sheet and we'll call that faculty list and this is gonna seem like overkill right now but we'll probably end up adding styles to this so don't don't worry about it and if it does end up being overkill dev style sheets will we can refactor hmm sorry about the yawn alright so we need to actually create this so we're gonna go into our static styles and we're gonna add another page and we're gonna still call this faculty list dot CSS and now see it's open and we're gonna we're gonna say in our faculty list dot CSS anything that's in this detail oops and what's what is a detailed view image element and it's an image we're gonna MIT set it at a max height of 300 pixels and let's save that we'll see see what happens here let's give it a refresh to get rid of what we've just done here all right wonderful so that's been pooled in oh and for a second we actually had the data that we wanted and what happened what happens happening weird and in this component so at least we have hmm there were images looking better better than they were and you can see this CSS has now successfully been imported here and if we we look we can see in dev tools that it's pulling that from faculty list dot CSS see we can see it's right here and we still as well have our other other styles being applied that were already there as well as our Styles here and then any inline styles that we may want to use those are applied as well so we have a lot of different levels of styles going on okay Harshit said check the console which is a great idea to see what what may be going on here did not match okay it says warning prop dangerously set enter HTML did not match server client interesting so it looks like that is why I'm getting this I said I yeah all right so something's wrong with the way I'm pulling in this title content so it looks like it's pulling it in initially but then it's taking it out because it's not matching what we'll divers on the server so anyway we'll we'll tackle that let me check how much time we have in this comodoro session okay about only about five more minutes so basically at this point I'm just gonna go I'm gonna do some more questions because I need to end the stream in a few minutes anyway so if I were getting all the data here that I would like to have then we may do a bit more styling just to make sure everything lines up and we would add that horizontal in here but basically it's gonna end up looking somewhat like this which I think will look pretty nice the only adjustment to make them may be made is like right now compared to the text the images are quite large you might not be a bad idea to maybe shrink these and do max height of maybe 250 pixels that way more faculty members can be displayed at once you know you could see them on one screen there wouldn't be the oldest space here so that I mean there there are some things that definitely could be done to improve it so right now I need to hurry through the rest of this live chat so normally I like to take my time and answer all the questions but unfortunately today I cannot and I actually completely forgot I had somewhere to go until I already started the stream and then I I got a message on my phone that I had that I had an employment and I panicked for a second and thought when is it when is it and but I I still had time to stream just a quick one all right I'm trying to figure out where I left off in the chat okay the Stevens here Steven says hey hey how's it going deepak says thank you so much for sharing your time with us all you're welcome well I mean that you all are sharing your time as well so I appreciate that appreciate you all watching in and helping me so don't this is definitely not a onesided thing here well Michael said why not set max height of road of to 300 to scale everything down yeah I guess I could have tried that although when we tried to set the container did for this image down to 300 the image is just kind of bled out anyway so anyway I mean this this works as it is I suppose but but had I seen that message earlier I probably would have tried it oh and then John said the same thing set it on the outer div group and let me try to pronounce this it's gee you are you Raj guru rush I'm gonna say guru Raj let me know if that's not how to pronounce it says please make shopping cart app with angular 6 and nodejs and latest material design I haven't worked with angular for a long long time let alone angular 6 so I don't think I'll be making that anytime soon so if anybody else has anything like that they're working on with egular please let us know see Michael creo says dr. John Homs yes we have a dr. John homes or homes or whatever you want to pronounce it I don't know okay Michael good thinking on that michael says the faculty right now are being brought in by their faculty ID and so that's how they're ordered but they should be ordered by last name alphabetically so we will do that actually I need to check what the current order is on the main website that's that's live the one that will be replaced and see if they actually are an alphabetic order there or if there's a different order I hope itself abetik oh I don't want to do a custom order for everyone all right looks like there's two more questions and then I have to be finished Matthew says what do you recommend if my job discourages asking for any mentorship in my programming skills I hear that it's really key to help help me grow but my boss wants me to be a 100% independent what do I do I would say that the best thing that you could do maybe is find information that shows how much mentoring will help you and really how being 100% independent will make you less productive because I definitely believe it will so I don't offhand know of any studies or information that I can point you to but I'm sure it's out there so I would maybe find that share that with your boss I mean you you know your boss better than I do of course so I don't know the best way to approach him with that information you may not want to just confront him with it maybe you wanted to slip in little comments here and there to warm him up I don't really know but you know you you want to show your boss how this will make you a better employee because that's probably what he's worried about you know and then if you can convince him of that then he should be okay with with mentorship and if he isn't still okay with it then then come ask me and we can think about a strategy for the next Phoenix says hey Jesse just an update on my 30 days 30 sites it's going good but it looks like I am doing 30 days 30 landing pages ha ha hey well it's it's still coding still coding every day okay that's CSS file you created was there a period in front of that class attribute and in from the image or I don't understand that where was it thoughtfully CSS no no period because the actual name of the elements is detailed view image right so we can see here the detailed view image so we're not targeting a class we're targeting in elements so I mean this technically is completely okay I believe in html5 it became okay don't I'm not sure that that's exactly when but so this wouldn't pass like I don't know what are those HTML certification things you know depending on your version but browsers browsers can handle this but then we go to use it with CSS we need to treat it just like we would let say a div where we wouldn't put a period in front of the div so hopefully that that answers your question hopefully I'm understanding it correctly okay thank you so much for joining me thank you for putting up with my lateness at the beginning and the errors that I had to deal with and I died for sure have to go right now if I make it to my appointment on time I had a great time and a great week with you all and I can't wait to come back next week and start streaming again so until then have a wonderful weekend
