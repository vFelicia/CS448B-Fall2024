00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jessie and today we're going to
00:12 - implement implement some search feature
00:16 - and we've done this way back in project
00:23 - 1 so well almost a year ago now maybe 10
00:31 - months ago we started with project ones
00:35 - it's been a long time so we're going to
00:37 - take a look back at what we did in that
00:39 - project and use that to help us get
00:43 - started on this project so just to give
00:46 - you a quick overview we're going to use
00:49 - the WordPress REST API so we're not
00:53 - going to use graph QL for this and the
00:55 - reason is with the WP graph QL plug-in
01:01 - you can't currently search across
01:04 - different post types and we need to have
01:08 - that so we have a lot of different post
01:11 - types right now in our WordPress
01:14 - installation and I don't really want the
01:18 - user to have to pick a post type to
01:21 - search with that's what we would have to
01:22 - do or potentially we would have to like
01:27 - when a search happened fire off a ton of
01:30 - requests to every single post type with
01:35 - graph QL and then get all the data back
01:38 - from all those requests put it all
01:39 - together and then show it's the user so
01:42 - I think it's gonna be a lot easier to
01:46 - just use the REST API to make the call
01:50 - so there's a plugin that you can use for
01:53 - the rest api that allows you to search
01:56 - multiple post types so that's what we're
02:00 - going to use so we'll check that out if
02:05 - it doesn't make sense right now when we
02:07 - get into it hopefully to make a little
02:08 - bit more sense when you see it
02:12 - and actually we're gonna do this may end
02:16 - up being a two-part show so my work on
02:20 - it today and tomorrow depending on how
02:22 - long it takes so we are gonna have to
02:25 - build a little bit of UI to display the
02:29 - search results so I'll be happy today if
02:32 - we can get just something basic showing
02:35 - up we can always work on the UI later
02:37 - but I just want to make sure that we can
02:39 - make calls to the WordPress API and get
02:43 - data back and just display something
02:48 - even if it's just some titles of the
02:51 - data and we'll have to work out we're
02:57 - gonna have to work out where that data
03:00 - goes like we'll direct them to a page
03:03 - it's yeah it's gonna be a little bit
03:06 - weird and I don't have all I don't have
03:09 - it all figured out yet so hopefully we
03:11 - can come to some type of you know
03:16 - solution as we work through this so
03:20 - before we get started just want to say a
03:23 - few things for those of you who are new
03:25 - maybe just watching for the first time
03:29 - in this stream I'm doing my regular
03:33 - day-to-day work as a front-end developer
03:34 - at a small University so there will be
03:38 - mistakes mistakes are actually probably
03:41 - the unique part about this stream so we
03:45 - do make mistakes but then we work
03:46 - through the mistakes together if you're
03:48 - watching and you have access to the live
03:50 - chat feel free to put any questions that
03:54 - you have in the chat or any suggestions
03:56 - for me I'd take a lot of feedback from
04:00 - you all and a lot of what you tell me
04:04 - ends up in the project if you want to
04:08 - check out the code for the project
04:10 - there's a link in the description and
04:12 - you can check it out everything's on
04:14 - github everything's open-source feel
04:16 - free to take any code from this project
04:18 - and use it in your own projects if
04:20 - you're looking to build up your
04:22 - portfolio and would like some
04:23 - open-source concert
04:24 - Lucian's feel free to to submit a pull
04:30 - request to this project there are issues
04:31 - on this project and on a lot of other
04:35 - projects that we've worked on in the
04:36 - past you can take an issue and submit
04:40 - pull requests on there don't worry if
04:43 - you're not exactly sure what to do just
04:44 - ask me and I'll help you out
04:46 - and that's it that's all that I normally
04:53 - say for this oh one more thing
04:57 - we split up our coding into twenty five
04:59 - minutes sessions so I'll set a timer if
05:01 - you ask a question during that 25
05:03 - minutes I probably won't see it but
05:06 - after that 25 minutes is up I'll take a
05:08 - little break and then I'll answer the
05:10 - questions so please be patient when
05:13 - answering when asking questions I will
05:15 - get to all the questions before I on the
05:17 - stream unless some emergency thing comes
05:20 - up and I have to end it but if you can
05:23 - stick around to the end or you can ask a
05:25 - question and then if you have to go
05:27 - that's cool and you can always watch the
05:28 - recording they are available the
05:31 - recordings are available just a few
05:32 - minutes after the stream ends here on
05:34 - the pre-code camp youtube channel ok so
05:39 - let me switch my screen and I said we're
05:46 - gonna start out in the repository for
05:49 - one of the projects we did a while ago
05:51 - and it's CI reacts and we're going to
05:56 - check out how we implemented a similar
05:59 - search function here and then see if we
06:02 - can use a lot of that code in our
06:05 - project that we'll work on today see
06:11 - pages
06:18 - resources in dependencies okay we
06:32 - actually have this on earth you if you
06:34 - see this this is kind of cool that this
06:36 - pops up but it says there's a
06:37 - vulnerability in one of our dependencies
06:40 - so we are we've already fixed this in a
06:43 - branch
06:44 - we just haven't merged that into master
06:48 - yet so just once you know I'm not
06:51 - ignoring this so this this was actually
06:54 - fixed in another branch before this
06:57 - warning ever even came up but that will
07:03 - be merged into master hopefully soon all
07:08 - right so let me see where you chills
07:14 - okay so what we might want to grab this
07:18 - utility as well let's see how we're
07:23 - doing this and Maki
07:29 - is there we are festive search-term
07:33 - debounce soars nice okay so we have a
07:40 - lot here and this is all I was a little
07:43 - bit afraid that there would have been
07:45 - jQuery in this because we did have a bit
07:47 - of jQuery in this project so it looks
07:49 - like there is no jQuery very happy about
07:52 - that so okay we have a lot of filters
08:00 - and things that are going on I may bring
08:04 - over all of this because eventually I
08:08 - would like to implement some filters in
08:10 - the search but you probably won't get to
08:14 - that today but I'll bring it over anyway
08:16 - and then we can just you'll hook those
08:19 - up into UI elements when we're ready for
08:23 - it make sure whoops I forgot to start
08:27 - the timer okay so I'm starting the timer
08:29 - now and while I'm copying and pasting
08:33 - this I I want to ask you Oh has anyone
08:41 - done anything with blockchain coding so
08:47 - I'm talking about like what crypto
08:49 - currencies are based on so I recently
08:51 - started doing just some really basic
08:54 - tutorial coding with etherium and it
08:59 - seems pretty cool and there's a
09:02 - JavaScript library that lets you work
09:07 - with that in any a JavaScript app so I'm
09:11 - interested if anybody else is into that
09:13 - or done any work with let me know in the
09:16 - in the live chat or if you're watching
09:17 - this later on let me know in the
09:18 - comments if you if you are working with
09:23 - it I'd like to hear what kind of things
09:24 - you're doing with that especially if
09:26 - you're using using it with JavaScript as
09:29 - well alright so I don't need
09:38 - new categories
09:46 - okay I think this is all I need just go
09:52 - over here I was working on the routing
09:55 - so I I said yesterday I would be working
09:58 - on the routing a lot and that's exactly
10:03 - what I'm doing
10:03 - so what we'll do is let's make another I
10:09 - haven't decided exactly how we're gonna
10:12 - display search results so for now I'm
10:14 - gonna make another page component and
10:18 - we'll do everything there I have some
10:21 - ideas where we may not have a separate
10:24 - page but we'll see so let's do a new
10:29 - file and let's call this search a s and
10:35 - let me let's go to here to our untitled
10:43 - page where we just throw things when we
10:45 - need to and we'll grab let's see this
10:53 - just to give us some boilerplate
11:01 - and let's get rid of that side and we'll
11:05 - copy this move this over give us some
11:10 - space okay so we won't need the query
11:17 - we'll get rid of that and we can keep
11:23 - our head header here and you know it
11:30 - actually let's should we keep this it
11:34 - alright let's keep the CSS for now let's
11:37 - get rid of really our Evaro all of our
11:42 - Apollo stuff we don't need the query we
11:47 - don't need with data okay let's get rid
11:58 - of this and oops I put those in the
12:05 - wrong spot
12:17 - and
12:25 - we actually won't need that at least not
12:31 - right now and let's we're gonna probably
12:39 - need to bring in some stuff as well so
12:41 - we'd be copying pasting a bit more let's
12:44 - save that and let's see yeah so we have
12:52 - this get get json utility so let's bring
12:57 - that over and we even be bounced as well
13:02 - so we'll need to bring in low - d bounce
13:14 - okay and maybe we'll use yeah you know
13:26 - what i'm not i think we're using
13:29 - something different yeah we use material
13:33 - you are materialized CSS so i can't use
13:36 - these UI components over again at least
13:39 - not easily all right so let's find this
13:42 - log or this gay json so you chose and
13:55 - fetch okay
14:12 - do we have a utility photo right now I
14:15 - don't think we do okay well let's make
14:21 - that folder then folder and within this
14:33 - folder then we're gonna make a new file
14:35 - and we're gonna call this fetch and we
14:44 - are going to save that now this was made
14:47 - with some earlier versions of a lot of
14:52 - things so hopefully this all still works
14:54 - right
14:57 - and we shouldn't need to do anything
15:02 - else with that for now
15:04 - yes learning the law let's get rid of
15:06 - that okay oh and we need lodash debounce
15:13 - so I just want to verify in our package
15:16 - JSON what we brought over and I am I'm
15:22 - just kind of moving around really fast
15:23 - so please ask questions if you have any
15:25 - questions I'm happy to slow down and
15:29 - kind of review things it kind of in a
15:33 - little bit more depth and explaining
15:34 - what I'm doing and after saying that I'm
15:39 - gonna glanced quickly at the live chat
15:41 - to see if anyone's asking questions
15:43 - about what we're doing right now
15:52 - okay I don't think I see anything about
15:54 - this right now so I do see some
15:56 - responses to what I asked earlier about
15:58 - blockchain stuff and when we take our
16:01 - first break we'll get to that okay so
16:04 - what did we okay so low - debounce cool
16:14 - so low - has a lot of helpers and things
16:18 - you can use but a cool thing is that you
16:21 - don't need to bring in all of low - so
16:23 - in this case we just want debounce so
16:27 - we're just going to bring in D bonds I
16:29 - think that's really awesome that we
16:32 - don't have to pull in you know
16:34 - everything if we're only going to use
16:36 - one thing so we're gonna do yarn add and
16:45 - what else we gonna do sorry I just I was
16:50 - thinking about something I did earlier
16:52 - and I realized I forgot to commit what I
16:55 - was doing before I started the stream it
16:58 - should be okay I just added a few routes
17:00 - in the router so it's not it's not a big
17:04 - deal all right okay so now we should
17:15 - have everything that we need here for
17:16 - these things to work but right now we
17:21 - we're not we really don't have anything
17:24 - going on here was this new JSON
17:28 - [Music]
17:34 - oh okay cool I didn't mean to bring this
17:38 - over but this is actually what we're
17:40 - gonna use here so I'm I'm glad that I
17:42 - brought this over because this needs to
17:48 - go up here so search term is gonna go
17:57 - but let me put this in up here so we can
18:00 - split it apart so for now this is where
18:08 - Vivi - there we go so we're gonna put
18:14 - this in here and then let's do search
18:31 - okay and I had tested this out with a
18:34 - search term Catholic since this is a
18:36 - Catholic school I figured that would
18:37 - give me some results and let me fill in
18:42 - the rest here okay so what what's
18:51 - happening here is that we're using this
18:53 - multiple post type search so I am going
18:59 - to take a second here to explain what's
19:00 - going on so we're using fetch which if
19:08 - you've never used fetch but you have
19:10 - done some work with JavaScript this this
19:13 - is like it's xhr so if you're familiar
19:16 - that or if you've used jQuery what's a
19:20 - clone jQuery AJAX then there's also
19:24 - libraries like Axios that'll help you do
19:27 - these types of requests but basically
19:30 - you can request data without a page
19:32 - refresh it's really nice for you know
19:35 - form submissions or in this case
19:37 - searching so we're gonna make one of
19:42 - those calls and right now we're giving
19:44 - it the URL so this is the the base URL
19:51 - to access the WordPress sorry uh-huh
20:00 - this is the base URL to access the
20:02 - WordPress API and the WordPress ap got
20:06 - API comes standard with WordPress now so
20:09 - it's not a separate plug-in like it used
20:11 - to be if you have WordPress installed
20:13 - you have the API as long as you have one
20:17 - of the newer versions of WordPress so
20:21 - we've installed in WordPress the
20:25 - multiple post type plug-in which allows
20:28 - us to search multiple post types so
20:31 - right now we're doing we're searching of
20:35 - any posts that has a type of page any
20:38 - one that has the type of
20:41 - pages anyone that has the type of chapel
20:45 - pages this is just a test
20:47 - We certainly have way more post types
20:50 - and we're gonna end up with a really
20:52 - long URL here but for now this is enough
20:57 - for us to to at least test things up and
21:03 - see okay so now we're just gonna call
21:08 - get JSON all right what takes us back to
21:10 - that utility that we had which is simply
21:12 - just kind of a wrapper around fetch and
21:15 - it's going to give us back the results
21:17 - in JSON format which is nice we can work
21:21 - well with with JSON so you just pass in
21:25 - that entire URL and then we're saving it
21:29 - to state so now within state we'll have
21:35 - data and we can access data the reason I
21:39 - would pass this I would set this as
21:42 - state is that we'll get a refresh so as
21:45 - soon as state updates will automatically
21:47 - rerender that component so as soon as we
21:51 - get the data back it'll trigger the
21:53 - rerender so this allows us you know to
21:55 - immediately show the results it's kind
22:01 - of nice I I don't know if you've ever
22:04 - done anything like this and tried to
22:06 - work it out with jQuery but there's
22:10 - always issues with like when does the
22:13 - data come and you know if you want to do
22:15 - different things with elements on the
22:17 - page like making sure the timing is
22:20 - right and everything happens so that you
22:21 - don't end up trying to select an element
22:23 - that doesn't even exist yet so with this
22:26 - you know with react we don't worry about
22:28 - the data comes in and then now we do a
22:32 - rerender with this data so some of the
22:37 - other things that we're doing with this
22:39 - is we're doing a debounce search so we
22:41 - don't have a I didn't put in a search
22:44 - input yet but what will happen with
22:47 - search input is it'll run these searches
22:50 - while you're typing so we don't want it
22:53 - to run like
22:54 - constantly that would make way too many
22:56 - calls so what we're doing is just kind
23:01 - of slowing down like how many searches
23:05 - happen and you can check out the lodash
23:10 - debounce page so if you type in lo - D
23:13 - balance you can get all the more
23:15 - information about exactly how that works
23:17 - all cool no way I didn't realize that
23:22 - this would tell me so anyway Visual
23:25 - Studio code is telling me a lot of stuff
23:27 - about debounce and it's telling me the
23:30 - parameters this is insane how did I not
23:33 - notice this stuff before this is so
23:37 - useful Wow Wow it even gives me saying
23:46 - check out this article for more
23:48 - information wow so crazy Wow did anybody
24:01 - else realize that okay so we're getting
24:11 - results results this this might make
24:15 - more sense once we actually put the
24:17 - input in but okay so on submit the first
24:26 - thing we're doing is preventing the
24:28 - default behavior all right which makes
24:29 - sense because we don't normally a submit
24:32 - of a form causes a page refresh but we
24:34 - don't want that to happen right so we
24:37 - got to prevent that and then we're gonna
24:42 - actually start the search so you can see
24:44 - down here we have this fetch search term
24:47 - and if we take the value of that search
24:53 - input which we will make and then we run
24:59 - this right I'm gonna skip over a lot of
25:04 - these filters because we're not gonna
25:05 - use them yet
25:07 - yeah so shows okay so this happens on
25:12 - submit' but then we also call this on
25:19 - while on the on change event so while
25:23 - we're typing this debounce search gets
25:27 - cold and it'll also run this fetch
25:31 - search term and I think I probably would
25:37 - have named this differently if I was
25:39 - doing it again but anyway there's we're
25:41 - not fetching the search term we have the
25:43 - search term we're actually running the
25:45 - search but anyway I'm uh gonna rename it
25:48 - right now all right so I'm gonna check
25:51 - how much time we have in this session so
25:55 - okay cool we have enough time so let's
25:58 - build out a little bit of the the UI so
26:00 - that we can enter in some data and do a
26:03 - search and then get some of that data
26:05 - back okay B I should yeah let me see if
26:15 - I can copy and paste a lot of what we
26:18 - have in in this repository now as I
26:25 - mentioned earlier we're using a totally
26:27 - different UI framework but for testing
26:29 - purposes I can probably just copy and
26:32 - paste some stuff over the styles won't
26:33 - work but it should at least let us do a
26:37 - search and then we can work out how to
26:40 - make it look pretty after we know that
26:42 - it works so pages resources let's check
26:50 - this
26:58 - whereas a search okay here's our form
27:04 - nice okay
27:17 - I think that's all we need
27:22 - cool alright let's paste this in here
27:30 - and let's see how this looks
27:46 - and let me see if I can just go to the
27:50 - search page if it'll let that happen
27:55 - nope okay so our
28:09 - yeah so we're gonna have to change the
28:11 - router a bit to let direct this page
28:15 - where it needs to go hmm I haven't
28:20 - thought about this
28:21 - and we're doing the router before so
28:27 - server da Jas file so let's see see how
28:37 - we need to do this
28:47 - I don't think this will work just like
28:51 - that let's sort the shot whoa what did I
28:58 - do
28:58 - oops you know what I forgot to share the
29:00 - anger uplink today so I'm gonna share
29:04 - that as well
29:08 - and your export you use compose maybe
29:11 - that's just not important maybe
29:21 - okay yeah it's trying to get search
29:24 - pages export kiss Jason was not found
29:30 - and he's so switch
29:53 - hmm
30:05 - all right so
30:33 - compose is not defined just 101 okay
30:51 - oops compose shoot do I need to bring in
30:59 - compose
31:07 - with Apollo I don't think I need to
31:20 - area okay I've forgotten that cool all
31:27 - right so search I wonder if I need this
31:34 - is the most terrible looking search
31:36 - thing I've ever seen
31:37 - all right but we do have the search okay
31:41 - so let's let's console.log our data so
31:55 - let's console.log this state data whoops
32:11 - what am i doing this state data
32:21 - so let's make sure our console is open
32:34 - okay so fetch failed loading
32:43 - okay but it did try to search for the
33:43 - okay
33:47 - so why is this not working
34:09 - interesting well you're not getting
34:12 - anything but this works all right so our
34:20 - our strain to search isn't working so
34:23 - that's what we'll do
34:25 - right after a five minute timer here and
34:29 - let me scroll up and answer as many
34:32 - questions as I can and let's see we have
34:36 - like double the viewers that we had the
34:39 - last time I checked so welcome everyone
34:41 - if you're joining me before I or after I
34:45 - did the the intro so we're gonna do five
34:47 - minutes of question answer then we'll go
34:49 - back into another 25-minute session of
34:51 - coding and if you happen to missed
34:55 - anything don't worry you can always
34:58 - watch the recording and and figure out
35:00 - what you know what we did at the
35:01 - beginning
35:03 - Fidel's says will you use the latest
35:06 - features of reacts such as fragment and
35:08 - report or anything for the latest you
35:10 - know what I try to use the latest
35:11 - features like number one if if I hear
35:14 - about them and I read about them when
35:16 - they first come out which I don't always
35:17 - have time to do but I try and then if
35:21 - there's an opportunity to use them in
35:23 - the project I try to so today probably
35:26 - won't be using any of those but you know
35:29 - we have done that in in previous streams
35:33 - sometimes we've we usually update to
35:36 - newer new versions of things immediately
35:38 - and try out you know whatever new stuff
35:42 - makes sense to try out in our projects
35:49 - we have Renato says good afternoon from
35:53 - Brazil and noble savage commented before
36:00 - the stream even started beard with lots
36:02 - of exclamation points and the the bot
36:04 - the bot banned them for five seconds for
36:07 - it but yes my beard is getting a little
36:13 - bit bushier
36:18 - and I knew yesterday who was it Michael
36:21 - mention that in the last video that I
36:23 - did on my channel you can see all the
36:26 - gray hair in my beard a lot so is that
36:29 - you did anybody watch that video is it
36:31 - really bad with the gray hair let me
36:35 - know I mean I I'm okay I'm not worried
36:38 - about my gray hair I worry more about
36:40 - the lack of hair up here than the gray
36:42 - hair down here my kids told me yesterday
36:44 - that I have a lot of hair except on my
36:48 - head so I immediately told my Amazon
36:52 - echo I said Alexa buy Rogaine and let
36:55 - that's like a medicine that's supposed
36:57 - to help you grow hey I didn't really buy
37:00 - it but I was tempted to let's see Nicki
37:06 - says this bracket syntax for react
37:08 - fragments work and create react app yet
37:11 - or do you have to write react off
37:12 - fragment YouTube chat won't let me post
37:14 - the actual syntax I don't know I don't
37:19 - know that we did we try it and create
37:22 - react app yet I don't think we tried it
37:26 - and create react app Nicki says asks
37:37 - about so I was talking about a theory
37:38 - I'm coding and so it's like blockchain
37:41 - and the saying are you using a special
37:44 - language just even gritter has a course
37:49 - on udemy for blockchain aetherium coding
37:51 - so yeah the language
37:53 - let me scroll over and see what language
37:55 - it was I don't even remember no shoot
38:00 - all right so the the tutorial that I was
38:06 - doing is called crypto zombies
38:08 - so it's crypto zombies io which it just
38:12 - seemed kind of fun like it's kind of
38:14 - like a game and you learn as you build
38:16 - out these characters in the game so
38:19 - that's what I'm using so if anybody's
38:21 - interested in doing that with me check
38:24 - out crypto zombies dot IO and so so far
38:30 - I'm only done with like the first
38:32 - like course so I've created one zombie
38:36 - but it was kind of cool it's pretty easy
38:38 - to learn it's definitely a little bit
38:41 - more rigid than JavaScript like you have
38:43 - to define a lot more like beforehand but
38:49 - it's not too hard if you already know
38:52 - about JavaScript you'd be able to fly
38:54 - through you know the first lesson I did
38:56 - the first lesson this like this morning
38:58 - and I don't like less than a half an
39:00 - hour
39:08 - ABI shakes his basic blockchain here as
39:10 - well
39:11 - using javascript not something that I
39:14 - really worked on we'd love to contribute
39:15 - though cool David asked what tutorial
39:18 - was going through so I guess I just
39:20 - answered that solidity that's it
39:24 - Nicki's Nikki has it the name of the
39:26 - language is solidity so that's what I've
39:29 - been been learning all right so the
39:36 - timer's let me write down where I got to
39:39 - in the chat which may be about halfway
39:43 - through the chat so didn't do that low
39:46 - and getting through but we'll get to the
39:49 - rest of it after the next Pomodoro
39:53 - session
40:05 - okay so what are we doing okay this
40:09 - doesn't work let's figure out why this
40:11 - doesn't work so I am going to go over to
40:15 - the plugins that I have in WordPress and
40:19 - make sure that that plug-in is there and
40:21 - it's activated it is don't you eat you
40:25 - folks if you alright so let's take this
40:28 - down multiple post type
40:44 - all right I am going to copy and paste
40:47 - the example
41:18 - and let me verify that that is the right
41:21 - IPA just 104 two three six four one five
41:25 - nine okay that is the right IP slug
41:31 - about me let's take this just say about
41:37 - let's try the example was the exemplar
41:41 - Catholic and we're not gonna do page
41:47 - let's do type
41:58 - yeah we should be able to do tape
42:06 - the shy major let me bring up do I have
42:14 - the post type so I don't think I have
42:16 - them up I have that custom plug-in and
42:24 - that tells me what all my types are so
42:28 - on my other screen I'm going to bring up
42:30 - that custom plugin so I can just view
42:34 - what types we have make sure I get the
42:36 - the correct names so we
42:45 - so you shall arrest directories so we do
42:51 - the directories for rest and what's the
42:58 - next thing news okay so those are types
43:10 - that we do have
43:33 - alright this is not good this did work
43:41 - alright I actually have let me pull this
43:44 - over just to show you so I tested this
43:48 - out earlier and it did work so oh that's
43:56 - what's different it's saying slug here
44:00 - but we did search so let me change this
44:08 - there we go ok so if we do search it
44:14 - works alright let's go back to our code
44:17 - and see where I messed this up
44:18 - so search alright so in here it actually
44:25 - it does work let's verify let me refresh
44:30 - that ok so this should work and this was
44:33 - the same let me make sure I didn't mess
44:35 - anything up actually I could check the
44:39 - this this will show us what we actually
44:41 - used HTTP colon slash slash
44:53 - question mark search and type equals
45:03 - pose
45:16 - okay all right so it looks like we have
45:19 - the right the right thing being searched
45:21 - for maybe actually I think I have an
45:33 - idea
46:06 - I mean I'm gonna check the live chat see
46:10 - what y'all think
46:35 - well yeah a whole conversation is going
46:38 - on in other languages all right Michael
46:48 - Creole says check search is 32 so it's
46:54 - line 32
46:55 - [Music]
47:07 - so it's this D bounced search cancel
47:34 - hmm
47:38 - okay all right so Michael said checking
47:41 - the error log
47:51 - let me get rid of this
48:28 - then we try this before copying it in
48:32 - there we didn't get anything okay so
48:33 - maybe there is something wrong with this
48:37 - all right let me check them right next
48:43 - to each other multiple posts that
48:45 - question works it was
49:03 - that's crazy they're the same
49:17 - all right let me do this I'm gonna copy
49:21 - and paste this right here
49:35 - so it is going to search this let me
49:42 - save it just to see what we can get here
49:46 - so when we hit search
50:02 - okay
50:58 - all right what am I
51:34 - oh there is something different right
51:41 - yeah there's something different between
51:43 - the two of these what is it
51:51 - alright I'm checking the live chat now
51:56 - you have an extra s Chappell page it may
52:06 - mayor that you're right I do have the
52:12 - extra s but it looks like it looks like
52:21 - it works either way of those so I I mean
52:23 - at least in the browser it could work
52:26 - with or without the S yeah it works with
52:32 - or without the S okay so
52:44 - all right here's what I should be able
52:47 - to do I should be able to figure out at
52:49 - what point it stops being the same with
52:53 - like this there we go there it is
53:02 - admissions page instead of admissions
53:06 - pages let's see which one is admissions
53:11 - page all right so let's see
53:37 - come on
54:01 - ok so now we at least know that our our
54:06 - string here for the URL it does work in
54:11 - the browser so it's just not working
54:18 - here all right okay so yeah just to
54:29 - verify oops let's remove this yep and
54:39 - they are the same now okay so let's take
54:44 - this up and take this out well actually
54:48 - let me let me just go back there we are
54:53 - and admissions pages and chapel I'm an
54:59 - admissions page and Chapel page okay
55:13 - let's see
55:20 - all right cool hey Harsha what's up
55:29 - we're just get chase on defined let's
55:34 - see
55:35 - so get JSON we're bringing it in up here
55:38 - in utils folder so let's bring it up
55:54 - area get JSON
56:20 - you import isomorphic fetch is the Ito's
56:26 - fetch import correct yeah I don't all
56:32 - right let's let me look at this Aragon
56:35 - okay so we are attempting to make a get
56:39 - request right
57:19 - the import fetch from isomorphic fetch
58:22 - Narsingh expand get function are
58:27 - let me let me give you the the end rot
58:31 - link to in case you wanna check that out
60:58 - hey we got it to work
61:07 - okay cool
61:16 - alright let's put some of this data in
61:17 - here
61:50 - title rendered alright let's try to get
61:54 - a title rendered for each of these nikki
62:00 - says so what was the Tet the fix I alts
62:03 - have for a second I don't even know I
62:05 - don't know what I I think the problem
62:09 - was I kept searching for just some
62:11 - nonsense and so I was getting back an
62:14 - empty array and then when I search for a
62:19 - term that I knew would give a result
62:22 - then I got a result so I could let me
62:25 - yeah that was fetch failed fetch failed
62:34 - yeah actually it keeps telling me it
62:40 - failed no matter what but if you look at
62:46 - the network I get status 200 okay
62:51 - success true I don't I don't know what's
62:57 - happening here
63:13 - III don't understand all right well
63:18 - let's just display a little bit of this
63:20 - quickly so I don't have much time in
63:24 - this session so let me just go to go
63:30 - here and say oops um I don't need that
63:41 - I'm in the layout so let's see
64:31 - all right so I'm not talking cuz I'm
64:34 - just trying to get this done before the
64:36 - timer comes up so key items how to
64:40 - render okay
65:05 - okay cool there we go all right it works
65:11 - all right so I can't believe I got that
65:14 - in before the time ran out all right so
65:16 - here's here's what I did I just said if
65:21 - this state data exists then I want you
65:24 - to map over all the items so remember
65:27 - this state data is an array of objects
65:31 - so I want you to map over everything and
65:38 - then we just use an arrow function so
65:42 - it's going to be inside this map so for
65:44 - each item that's gonna represent a
65:47 - different object so I just did a div I
65:51 - put a key on there or else react
65:53 - complains that there's no key so I just
65:56 - use the ID and then since I'm used to
65:58 - using the WordPress API I knew exactly
66:00 - where this was which which helped so
66:02 - item title rendered gave us the data we
66:06 - needed so now when we search we get the
66:10 - titles so let's try it out with a
66:11 - different search term Chappell awesome
66:16 - so Chappell and students great so we're
66:25 - getting different search items based on
66:33 - that why are we only always getting ten
66:38 - all right I'll have to work on that but
66:42 - basically it worked we have a search
66:44 - function now we can't do that much with
66:47 - it but we have it and it works so
66:50 - awesome so now let me go back to where I
66:55 - was in the live chat where I left off
66:57 - that last time and I'm gonna go through
67:06 - I'm gonna go through all the rest of the
67:08 - questions mr. Tommy yeah I'm gonna go
67:11 - through all the rest if you have a
67:12 - question or comment please put in the
67:15 - live chat now and I will I'll get to
67:18 - everything in the live chat so the
67:20 - coding portion of this is pretty much
67:22 - over
67:22 - we depending on what questions are we
67:24 - may go back to the code and do a thing
67:26 - or two but for the most we're not gonna
67:28 - do a whole other point or a session of
67:30 - coding maybe tomorrow we'll go back to
67:34 - this and build out the UI and build out
67:37 - some of those filtering options because
67:39 - I want you to be able to be fill to
67:40 - filter this stuff like you're at
67:42 - amazon.com right
67:45 - I want users to be able to just narrowly
67:47 - filter everything to get exactly what
67:50 - they want so actually not I think about
67:55 - it that might be more than one more
67:57 - stream to make all that happen but about
68:00 - will probably work on it frog for the
68:03 - rest of the week and that's something
68:04 - else more important comes up Alexi says
68:11 - hello Jesse are you leveling up as a
68:13 - programmer I think I am I think I'm
68:17 - learning more every day so that's all we
68:21 - can do right just try to keep learning
68:23 - and and keep going what we can so yeah I
68:29 - guess I'm leveling up slowly but surely
68:31 - I don't know but you all let me know
68:35 - does it seem like I'm a better
68:36 - programmer now then a few months ago or
68:40 - or have I gone downhill in my past my
68:43 - prime yet Alexi says you look like a
68:48 - wizard with that beard cool I will I
68:51 - take that as a compliment I like the
68:54 - there's something relaxing about just
68:57 - being able to just stroke your beard
68:59 - like this my wife thinks it's weird she
69:03 - just laughs at me but it's fine and it
69:08 - does protect your face a little bit from
69:10 - the cold and from babies who try to grab
69:12 - your face and give you like battle scars
69:15 - like this one they go to grab your face
69:18 - instead they get a handful of beard so
69:20 - it's definitely functional as well as
69:23 - fashionable every shake says where you
69:34 - copying code from sorry I haven't been
69:36 - that involved with this whole process in
69:37 - the beginning oh okay
69:39 - Oh Annie he answered it already it's a
69:42 - good answer so Nicky says he's taking
69:43 - the code from a previous project he's
69:45 - done it's C I react on github yeah that
69:49 - is so on if you wanted to check out the
69:51 - project we are copying things from at
69:53 - the beginning it's CI - react on the
69:57 - github repository that we work from so
70:00 - it's it's a what's it called
70:03 - organization repository so fu fu s -
70:07 - marcom M AR CLM is the repository so my
70:11 - personal github is separate from that
70:15 - although I'm the the owner of the
70:17 - repository I guess yeah but you check
70:21 - out there and it's also project one in
70:24 - our series of videos so if you want to
70:26 - watch any of the videos when we first
70:28 - implemented that search function you
70:31 - could go back and check that out trying
70:34 - to think not all of my videos are titled
70:38 - well but I think I did put descriptive
70:42 - titles for that first project
70:50 - Aniki asks how does isomorphic fetch
70:53 - differ from regular fetch so isomorphic
70:57 - fetch so regular fetch works in the
70:59 - browser I mean assuming you have a newer
71:02 - browser where you can polyfill it
71:04 - isomorphic fetch works in on the server
71:08 - with with node so that's why we're using
71:13 - isomorphic fetch as well in kind of
71:17 - thing hmm so we probably didn't need to
71:25 - use it here because this is all
71:27 - happening client-side not server-side
71:29 - but the project where I copied it from
71:31 - we were actually making client and
71:34 - server-side calls not for the search but
71:36 - for loading some other data so that's
71:39 - why it was using isomorphic fetch so we
71:41 - didn't really need to do that but I mean
71:46 - it's nice to have that utility if we do
71:48 - need to use it you know we can use it
71:51 - server-side as well since we're using
71:52 - next we can use it in inside that that
71:57 - props would it lose that function called
72:00 - I can't remember is it props something
72:07 - what is it called
72:14 - and we're not using it here or we using
72:16 - this get initial props function that
72:20 - comes with neck so things in here will
72:22 - run server side and client side
72:36 - Raphael says good afternoon from
72:38 - Venezuela welcome thanks for watching
72:51 - Victoria says where is the past video
72:58 - tutorial help ok so we have a lot of
73:03 - other videos so there's a playlist on
73:07 - the free code camp YouTube channel
73:09 - called live coding with Jesse that has
73:11 - all the videos it's a lot of videos
73:14 - right now so I'm not really sure how
73:18 - you'd want to go about watching them I
73:23 - would say maybe just check out the
73:26 - titles and watch one of the videos that
73:27 - seems interesting to you based on the
73:30 - title also people have told me that it
73:35 - helps to watch the video at like 2 times
73:38 - speed and then just to slow it down if
73:41 - there's something you're really
73:42 - interested in and I'll recommend that I
73:44 - tried it as well I think the videos when
73:47 - you're watching the recording are much
73:48 - better at a faster speed it makes me
73:52 - look better because I type really fast
73:54 - and I talk really fast
73:56 - if you've set it on a faster speed
74:03 - let's see John says fetch and react is
74:09 - so much easier than jQuery AJAX call
74:11 - yeah I agree I think fetch is the
74:14 - easiest way to make Network requests
74:22 - Abhishek says fetch is polyfill for
74:25 - browsers which don't have fetch function
74:28 - it adds fetch function to your browser
74:30 - dice amorphic to your browser period
74:34 - isomorphic is implementation of fetch
74:36 - for both no GS and browser on top of the
74:38 - technical alright yeah exactly
74:40 - so Abhishek was answering the question
74:43 - about the difference between regular
74:45 - fetch and isomorphic fetch so that's
74:46 - exactly right the crap Pathan says I
74:54 - just got here what's so amazing Visual
74:59 - Studio code is amazing when what it
75:03 - where was it
75:05 - with debounce so if I hover over
75:09 - debounce
75:10 - it gives me all this information about
75:13 - the bounce it lets me know what it does
75:18 - and then it also says it recommends an
75:21 - article for me to get more information
75:24 - it gives me all the parameters that I
75:28 - could possibly use and it describes what
75:30 - they do it's really cool right it's
75:34 - right there I mean normally I just look
75:37 - it up on my other screen but being right
75:41 - there is really awesome
75:50 - michael says isn't that up to the author
75:53 - of the extension to write I'm guessing
75:55 - that that is the case I mean I I don't I
75:59 - really don't think Visual Studio code is
76:02 - going out and like searching for this so
76:03 - I'd imagine that's the case but either
76:08 - way it's really cool that this pops up
76:10 - and if it is the the author of this
76:14 - extension then good job on that thank
76:18 - you
76:18 - that's awesome feature John says with
76:24 - that revelation of amazing code feedback
76:26 - in BS code it looks like I may change my
76:28 - editor yeah I mean that that's a really
76:32 - nice feature alright was so there's a
76:42 - lot of conversation back and forth in a
76:45 - different alphabet than I use so I'm not
76:48 - gonna try to translate all of that if
76:50 - anybody wants to if any of those
76:55 - questions were directed to me then let
76:59 - me know but it's just a lot to go
77:02 - through and translate right now so I'm
77:03 - not I'm not gonna do that on the stream
77:05 - I might go after the stream and
77:06 - translate everything
77:26 - Michael earlier I mentioned that Michael
77:28 - had said that you could see my gray hair
77:30 - and my the latest video so I I didn't
77:33 - think I've talked about I didn't mention
77:35 - with the video was so I just went on an
77:36 - interview I interviewed for a position
77:39 - as a full-stack engineer and I did a
77:42 - video on my own YouTube channel which is
77:44 - linked in the description just
77:46 - explaining what the interview was like
77:49 - and then giving some of my thoughts and
77:52 - advice on coding interviews so if you're
77:56 - interested please check that video out
77:58 - and Michael says it wasn't as bad as or
78:03 - no wasn't it Michael says it was only a
78:05 - hair or two Nicky says not as bad as I
78:09 - thought was quite disappointed about
78:10 - that yeah so I don't have that much gray
78:12 - hair you can't really tell in these
78:15 - videos the resolutions not as high but
78:17 - the other video I did was a better
78:20 - camera and so you
78:22 - I guess you could tell they said the
78:28 - grey hair doesn't bother me then less
78:31 - hair on my head bothers me a lot more
78:40 - okay John says that the new bracket
78:43 - syntax for fragments does not yet work
78:45 - and create react okay good to know so I
78:49 - do have some projects that I haven't
78:52 - create react apps some of them we have
78:54 - using next so that's just something
78:57 - we're going to have to keep in mind if
79:00 - we use that to make sure we we think
79:02 - about okay what what are we using with
79:04 - this project will it work okay
79:09 - curious truth asks how much time should
79:12 - I put into CSS early on I actually
79:15 - really dislike it so I'm really having
79:17 - to force myself to work with it and
79:19 - inevitably end up procrastinating I
79:22 - would say and I'm gonna read out some of
79:27 - the answers as well but that others have
79:30 - given but I would say this depending on
79:33 - what you want to do CSS might not be
79:37 - that important for you if you really
79:39 - want to be a front-end developer you are
79:41 - gonna didn't need to know some CSS but
79:44 - you can get away with using some
79:46 - frameworks and focus more on JavaScript
79:50 - and you'll be okay with that and
79:53 - depending on where you work you may be
79:55 - able to get away with that even more if
79:59 - you want to do more of like back-end or
80:02 - even be like full stack with a back-end
80:04 - focus then you're probably safe to skip
80:09 - over a lot of CSS stuff and just do
80:11 - focus more on JavaScript so it just kind
80:15 - of depends on how much friend do you
80:18 - want to do and then what would job so I
80:25 - guess right now if CSS is holding you
80:27 - back from learning more you're fine to
80:31 - just focus more on JavaScript but if you
80:34 - start to have to have a job that you
80:37 - really wants and you need to use it of
80:39 - course you're gonna have to learn that
80:40 - but not every developer job are you even
80:43 - going to need to use CSS that much if
80:45 - they already have a style guide or
80:48 - certain framework that they use you may
80:50 - not even have a
80:51 - freedom to do very much with CSS so it
80:54 - may not be a big deal depending on who
80:56 - else you have on your team
80:58 - so if you if you're gonna do like
80:59 - freelance stuff and you're going to be
81:01 - expected to do everything on a project
81:03 - then you're gonna need to know CSS so in
81:06 - anyway hopefully that's a decent answer
81:09 - let's see what what everyone else said
81:13 - John says it depends on your goals what
81:16 - kind of developer you want to be CSS as
81:18 - part of the whole design and function
81:20 - process pretty important to have a
81:21 - fairly good understanding okay so also
81:24 - good answer
81:36 - okay so old sauce is explained a little
81:39 - bit about what what they are talking
81:41 - about and I wonder
81:46 - I'm not exactly sure what language that
81:48 - is like I don't want to know now but
81:57 - basically it was just someone asking
82:00 - about like what I was talking about so
82:02 - far okay it's Russian so it looked like
82:09 - Russian
82:28 - hm
82:41 - see
82:46 - Michael Michael put like a little like
82:50 - laughing crying emoji saying we'll be
82:52 - will rebuild Amazon search tomorrow yeah
82:55 - I didn't I didn't realize that when I
82:58 - said it but you're right that does sound
82:59 - ridiculous that I'm gonna do it just
83:01 - like Amazon say I'm not it wasn't my
83:07 - intention
83:08 - Amazon search is way too advanced for
83:11 - what we're gonna do it but we're we're
83:13 - gonna try to make our search more like
83:16 - Amazon search let's see
83:33 - hard should ask if I can test messaging
83:36 - in JavaScript AF which is one of our
83:40 - side projects yeah I could test the
83:43 - messaging and if Michael says the day
83:52 - after that we'll refine Google's
83:53 - algorithm alright jr. says hello from
84:03 - Africa from Senegal I love your live
84:06 - coding Oh awesome thanks for saying that
84:09 - thanks for watching that means a lot
84:12 - when when you all say things like that I
84:15 - appreciate it
84:31 - oh it's so harsh it is saying that most
84:35 - mature packages right those like this
84:38 - kind of thing now if it'll so that's
84:42 - really cool I'm gonna have to kind of
84:46 - try to do this more and hover over
84:48 - things and just see like what would
84:51 - extra info I think this is really useful
84:54 - it may be able to get like extra
84:56 - functionality out of things whereas
84:57 - normally I would just use what I I know
84:59 - and wouldn't take the extra time to look
85:03 - it up you know but this is so convenient
85:05 - you know I may be able to find a
85:08 - parameter that may give me a something
85:10 - better that's cool I like that world
85:16 - says you're only like 30 why do you have
85:18 - gray hairs already I don't know I'm 32 I
85:22 - don't know why like I'm losing my hair
85:24 - on the top and I have gray hair and my
85:27 - beard like what is I don't know what
85:30 - what's wrong with that it's like anyway
85:41 - yeah maybe it's the kids I do have four
85:44 - kids and so maybe maybe they cause my
85:49 - grade you know what it was I used to
85:51 - teach high school that's what did I'm
85:54 - convinced that's what did it I taught
85:56 - high school for like almost four years
86:00 - that must be it does that is teaching
86:06 - high school students is super stressful
86:11 - it's so stressful so I'm gonna blame it
86:18 - on that I mean maybe I could blame it on
86:24 - semicolons but now that I use you know
86:28 - standard style I don't have semicolons
86:31 - so I'm a lot more relaxed
86:36 - all right well I have made it to the end
86:40 - of the live chat horseshit I see I was
86:43 - just reminding me to test the messaging
86:45 - I will I will do my best to test the
86:49 - messenger okay so I'll be back tomorrow
86:56 - I don't think we have not we I don't
87:01 - think I have any meetings going on
87:03 - tomorrow so should be able to stream at
87:05 - the normal time and we'll be working on
87:07 - this search again and refining it a bit
87:10 - in the meantime I'm just going to be
87:12 - adding new things to our routing
87:14 - functions so you get more of the site
87:16 - accessible from the proper URLs and I'll
87:22 - be working on making sure all the data
87:24 - is formatted correctly in WordPress or
87:27 - as correctly as we can get it at this
87:29 - point so in the meantime if you have any
87:33 - questions you can always reach out to me
87:35 - on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or
87:37 - wherever else you can find me or comment
87:41 - in this video if you if you're
87:43 - interested at all in the interview
87:45 - process so I just went through please
87:47 - check out my youtube channel and watch
87:51 - the the latest video and so until
87:56 - tomorrow let's have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're going to implement implement some search feature and we've done this way back in project 1 so well almost a year ago now maybe 10 months ago we started with project ones it's been a long time so we're going to take a look back at what we did in that project and use that to help us get started on this project so just to give you a quick overview we're going to use the WordPress REST API so we're not going to use graph QL for this and the reason is with the WP graph QL plugin you can't currently search across different post types and we need to have that so we have a lot of different post types right now in our WordPress installation and I don't really want the user to have to pick a post type to search with that's what we would have to do or potentially we would have to like when a search happened fire off a ton of requests to every single post type with graph QL and then get all the data back from all those requests put it all together and then show it's the user so I think it's gonna be a lot easier to just use the REST API to make the call so there's a plugin that you can use for the rest api that allows you to search multiple post types so that's what we're going to use so we'll check that out if it doesn't make sense right now when we get into it hopefully to make a little bit more sense when you see it and actually we're gonna do this may end up being a twopart show so my work on it today and tomorrow depending on how long it takes so we are gonna have to build a little bit of UI to display the search results so I'll be happy today if we can get just something basic showing up we can always work on the UI later but I just want to make sure that we can make calls to the WordPress API and get data back and just display something even if it's just some titles of the data and we'll have to work out we're gonna have to work out where that data goes like we'll direct them to a page it's yeah it's gonna be a little bit weird and I don't have all I don't have it all figured out yet so hopefully we can come to some type of you know solution as we work through this so before we get started just want to say a few things for those of you who are new maybe just watching for the first time in this stream I'm doing my regular daytoday work as a frontend developer at a small University so there will be mistakes mistakes are actually probably the unique part about this stream so we do make mistakes but then we work through the mistakes together if you're watching and you have access to the live chat feel free to put any questions that you have in the chat or any suggestions for me I'd take a lot of feedback from you all and a lot of what you tell me ends up in the project if you want to check out the code for the project there's a link in the description and you can check it out everything's on github everything's opensource feel free to take any code from this project and use it in your own projects if you're looking to build up your portfolio and would like some opensource concert Lucian's feel free to to submit a pull request to this project there are issues on this project and on a lot of other projects that we've worked on in the past you can take an issue and submit pull requests on there don't worry if you're not exactly sure what to do just ask me and I'll help you out and that's it that's all that I normally say for this oh one more thing we split up our coding into twenty five minutes sessions so I'll set a timer if you ask a question during that 25 minutes I probably won't see it but after that 25 minutes is up I'll take a little break and then I'll answer the questions so please be patient when answering when asking questions I will get to all the questions before I on the stream unless some emergency thing comes up and I have to end it but if you can stick around to the end or you can ask a question and then if you have to go that's cool and you can always watch the recording they are available the recordings are available just a few minutes after the stream ends here on the precode camp youtube channel ok so let me switch my screen and I said we're gonna start out in the repository for one of the projects we did a while ago and it's CI reacts and we're going to check out how we implemented a similar search function here and then see if we can use a lot of that code in our project that we'll work on today see pages resources in dependencies okay we actually have this on earth you if you see this this is kind of cool that this pops up but it says there's a vulnerability in one of our dependencies so we are we've already fixed this in a branch we just haven't merged that into master yet so just once you know I'm not ignoring this so this this was actually fixed in another branch before this warning ever even came up but that will be merged into master hopefully soon all right so let me see where you chills okay so what we might want to grab this utility as well let's see how we're doing this and Maki is there we are festive searchterm debounce soars nice okay so we have a lot here and this is all I was a little bit afraid that there would have been jQuery in this because we did have a bit of jQuery in this project so it looks like there is no jQuery very happy about that so okay we have a lot of filters and things that are going on I may bring over all of this because eventually I would like to implement some filters in the search but you probably won't get to that today but I'll bring it over anyway and then we can just you'll hook those up into UI elements when we're ready for it make sure whoops I forgot to start the timer okay so I'm starting the timer now and while I'm copying and pasting this I I want to ask you Oh has anyone done anything with blockchain coding so I'm talking about like what crypto currencies are based on so I recently started doing just some really basic tutorial coding with etherium and it seems pretty cool and there's a JavaScript library that lets you work with that in any a JavaScript app so I'm interested if anybody else is into that or done any work with let me know in the in the live chat or if you're watching this later on let me know in the comments if you if you are working with it I'd like to hear what kind of things you're doing with that especially if you're using using it with JavaScript as well alright so I don't need new categories okay I think this is all I need just go over here I was working on the routing so I I said yesterday I would be working on the routing a lot and that's exactly what I'm doing so what we'll do is let's make another I haven't decided exactly how we're gonna display search results so for now I'm gonna make another page component and we'll do everything there I have some ideas where we may not have a separate page but we'll see so let's do a new file and let's call this search a s and let me let's go to here to our untitled page where we just throw things when we need to and we'll grab let's see this just to give us some boilerplate and let's get rid of that side and we'll copy this move this over give us some space okay so we won't need the query we'll get rid of that and we can keep our head header here and you know it actually let's should we keep this it alright let's keep the CSS for now let's get rid of really our Evaro all of our Apollo stuff we don't need the query we don't need with data okay let's get rid of this and oops I put those in the wrong spot and we actually won't need that at least not right now and let's we're gonna probably need to bring in some stuff as well so we'd be copying pasting a bit more let's save that and let's see yeah so we have this get get json utility so let's bring that over and we even be bounced as well so we'll need to bring in low d bounce okay and maybe we'll use yeah you know what i'm not i think we're using something different yeah we use material you are materialized CSS so i can't use these UI components over again at least not easily all right so let's find this log or this gay json so you chose and fetch okay do we have a utility photo right now I don't think we do okay well let's make that folder then folder and within this folder then we're gonna make a new file and we're gonna call this fetch and we are going to save that now this was made with some earlier versions of a lot of things so hopefully this all still works right and we shouldn't need to do anything else with that for now yes learning the law let's get rid of that okay oh and we need lodash debounce so I just want to verify in our package JSON what we brought over and I am I'm just kind of moving around really fast so please ask questions if you have any questions I'm happy to slow down and kind of review things it kind of in a little bit more depth and explaining what I'm doing and after saying that I'm gonna glanced quickly at the live chat to see if anyone's asking questions about what we're doing right now okay I don't think I see anything about this right now so I do see some responses to what I asked earlier about blockchain stuff and when we take our first break we'll get to that okay so what did we okay so low debounce cool so low has a lot of helpers and things you can use but a cool thing is that you don't need to bring in all of low so in this case we just want debounce so we're just going to bring in D bonds I think that's really awesome that we don't have to pull in you know everything if we're only going to use one thing so we're gonna do yarn add and what else we gonna do sorry I just I was thinking about something I did earlier and I realized I forgot to commit what I was doing before I started the stream it should be okay I just added a few routes in the router so it's not it's not a big deal all right okay so now we should have everything that we need here for these things to work but right now we we're not we really don't have anything going on here was this new JSON oh okay cool I didn't mean to bring this over but this is actually what we're gonna use here so I'm I'm glad that I brought this over because this needs to go up here so search term is gonna go but let me put this in up here so we can split it apart so for now this is where Vivi there we go so we're gonna put this in here and then let's do search okay and I had tested this out with a search term Catholic since this is a Catholic school I figured that would give me some results and let me fill in the rest here okay so what what's happening here is that we're using this multiple post type search so I am going to take a second here to explain what's going on so we're using fetch which if you've never used fetch but you have done some work with JavaScript this this is like it's xhr so if you're familiar that or if you've used jQuery what's a clone jQuery AJAX then there's also libraries like Axios that'll help you do these types of requests but basically you can request data without a page refresh it's really nice for you know form submissions or in this case searching so we're gonna make one of those calls and right now we're giving it the URL so this is the the base URL to access the WordPress sorry uhhuh this is the base URL to access the WordPress API and the WordPress ap got API comes standard with WordPress now so it's not a separate plugin like it used to be if you have WordPress installed you have the API as long as you have one of the newer versions of WordPress so we've installed in WordPress the multiple post type plugin which allows us to search multiple post types so right now we're doing we're searching of any posts that has a type of page any one that has the type of pages anyone that has the type of chapel pages this is just a test We certainly have way more post types and we're gonna end up with a really long URL here but for now this is enough for us to to at least test things up and see okay so now we're just gonna call get JSON all right what takes us back to that utility that we had which is simply just kind of a wrapper around fetch and it's going to give us back the results in JSON format which is nice we can work well with with JSON so you just pass in that entire URL and then we're saving it to state so now within state we'll have data and we can access data the reason I would pass this I would set this as state is that we'll get a refresh so as soon as state updates will automatically rerender that component so as soon as we get the data back it'll trigger the rerender so this allows us you know to immediately show the results it's kind of nice I I don't know if you've ever done anything like this and tried to work it out with jQuery but there's always issues with like when does the data come and you know if you want to do different things with elements on the page like making sure the timing is right and everything happens so that you don't end up trying to select an element that doesn't even exist yet so with this you know with react we don't worry about the data comes in and then now we do a rerender with this data so some of the other things that we're doing with this is we're doing a debounce search so we don't have a I didn't put in a search input yet but what will happen with search input is it'll run these searches while you're typing so we don't want it to run like constantly that would make way too many calls so what we're doing is just kind of slowing down like how many searches happen and you can check out the lodash debounce page so if you type in lo D balance you can get all the more information about exactly how that works all cool no way I didn't realize that this would tell me so anyway Visual Studio code is telling me a lot of stuff about debounce and it's telling me the parameters this is insane how did I not notice this stuff before this is so useful Wow Wow it even gives me saying check out this article for more information wow so crazy Wow did anybody else realize that okay so we're getting results results this this might make more sense once we actually put the input in but okay so on submit the first thing we're doing is preventing the default behavior all right which makes sense because we don't normally a submit of a form causes a page refresh but we don't want that to happen right so we got to prevent that and then we're gonna actually start the search so you can see down here we have this fetch search term and if we take the value of that search input which we will make and then we run this right I'm gonna skip over a lot of these filters because we're not gonna use them yet yeah so shows okay so this happens on submit' but then we also call this on while on the on change event so while we're typing this debounce search gets cold and it'll also run this fetch search term and I think I probably would have named this differently if I was doing it again but anyway there's we're not fetching the search term we have the search term we're actually running the search but anyway I'm uh gonna rename it right now all right so I'm gonna check how much time we have in this session so okay cool we have enough time so let's build out a little bit of the the UI so that we can enter in some data and do a search and then get some of that data back okay B I should yeah let me see if I can copy and paste a lot of what we have in in this repository now as I mentioned earlier we're using a totally different UI framework but for testing purposes I can probably just copy and paste some stuff over the styles won't work but it should at least let us do a search and then we can work out how to make it look pretty after we know that it works so pages resources let's check this whereas a search okay here's our form nice okay I think that's all we need cool alright let's paste this in here and let's see how this looks and let me see if I can just go to the search page if it'll let that happen nope okay so our yeah so we're gonna have to change the router a bit to let direct this page where it needs to go hmm I haven't thought about this and we're doing the router before so server da Jas file so let's see see how we need to do this I don't think this will work just like that let's sort the shot whoa what did I do oops you know what I forgot to share the anger uplink today so I'm gonna share that as well and your export you use compose maybe that's just not important maybe okay yeah it's trying to get search pages export kiss Jason was not found and he's so switch hmm all right so compose is not defined just 101 okay oops compose shoot do I need to bring in compose with Apollo I don't think I need to area okay I've forgotten that cool all right so search I wonder if I need this is the most terrible looking search thing I've ever seen all right but we do have the search okay so let's let's console.log our data so let's console.log this state data whoops what am i doing this state data so let's make sure our console is open okay so fetch failed loading okay but it did try to search for the okay so why is this not working interesting well you're not getting anything but this works all right so our our strain to search isn't working so that's what we'll do right after a five minute timer here and let me scroll up and answer as many questions as I can and let's see we have like double the viewers that we had the last time I checked so welcome everyone if you're joining me before I or after I did the the intro so we're gonna do five minutes of question answer then we'll go back into another 25minute session of coding and if you happen to missed anything don't worry you can always watch the recording and and figure out what you know what we did at the beginning Fidel's says will you use the latest features of reacts such as fragment and report or anything for the latest you know what I try to use the latest features like number one if if I hear about them and I read about them when they first come out which I don't always have time to do but I try and then if there's an opportunity to use them in the project I try to so today probably won't be using any of those but you know we have done that in in previous streams sometimes we've we usually update to newer new versions of things immediately and try out you know whatever new stuff makes sense to try out in our projects we have Renato says good afternoon from Brazil and noble savage commented before the stream even started beard with lots of exclamation points and the the bot the bot banned them for five seconds for it but yes my beard is getting a little bit bushier and I knew yesterday who was it Michael mention that in the last video that I did on my channel you can see all the gray hair in my beard a lot so is that you did anybody watch that video is it really bad with the gray hair let me know I mean I I'm okay I'm not worried about my gray hair I worry more about the lack of hair up here than the gray hair down here my kids told me yesterday that I have a lot of hair except on my head so I immediately told my Amazon echo I said Alexa buy Rogaine and let that's like a medicine that's supposed to help you grow hey I didn't really buy it but I was tempted to let's see Nicki says this bracket syntax for react fragments work and create react app yet or do you have to write react off fragment YouTube chat won't let me post the actual syntax I don't know I don't know that we did we try it and create react app yet I don't think we tried it and create react app Nicki says asks about so I was talking about a theory I'm coding and so it's like blockchain and the saying are you using a special language just even gritter has a course on udemy for blockchain aetherium coding so yeah the language let me scroll over and see what language it was I don't even remember no shoot all right so the the tutorial that I was doing is called crypto zombies so it's crypto zombies io which it just seemed kind of fun like it's kind of like a game and you learn as you build out these characters in the game so that's what I'm using so if anybody's interested in doing that with me check out crypto zombies dot IO and so so far I'm only done with like the first like course so I've created one zombie but it was kind of cool it's pretty easy to learn it's definitely a little bit more rigid than JavaScript like you have to define a lot more like beforehand but it's not too hard if you already know about JavaScript you'd be able to fly through you know the first lesson I did the first lesson this like this morning and I don't like less than a half an hour ABI shakes his basic blockchain here as well using javascript not something that I really worked on we'd love to contribute though cool David asked what tutorial was going through so I guess I just answered that solidity that's it Nicki's Nikki has it the name of the language is solidity so that's what I've been been learning all right so the timer's let me write down where I got to in the chat which may be about halfway through the chat so didn't do that low and getting through but we'll get to the rest of it after the next Pomodoro session okay so what are we doing okay this doesn't work let's figure out why this doesn't work so I am going to go over to the plugins that I have in WordPress and make sure that that plugin is there and it's activated it is don't you eat you folks if you alright so let's take this down multiple post type all right I am going to copy and paste the example and let me verify that that is the right IPA just 104 two three six four one five nine okay that is the right IP slug about me let's take this just say about let's try the example was the exemplar Catholic and we're not gonna do page let's do type yeah we should be able to do tape the shy major let me bring up do I have the post type so I don't think I have them up I have that custom plugin and that tells me what all my types are so on my other screen I'm going to bring up that custom plugin so I can just view what types we have make sure I get the the correct names so we so you shall arrest directories so we do the directories for rest and what's the next thing news okay so those are types that we do have alright this is not good this did work alright I actually have let me pull this over just to show you so I tested this out earlier and it did work so oh that's what's different it's saying slug here but we did search so let me change this there we go ok so if we do search it works alright let's go back to our code and see where I messed this up so search alright so in here it actually it does work let's verify let me refresh that ok so this should work and this was the same let me make sure I didn't mess anything up actually I could check the this this will show us what we actually used HTTP colon slash slash question mark search and type equals pose okay all right so it looks like we have the right the right thing being searched for maybe actually I think I have an idea I mean I'm gonna check the live chat see what y'all think well yeah a whole conversation is going on in other languages all right Michael Creole says check search is 32 so it's line 32 so it's this D bounced search cancel hmm okay all right so Michael said checking the error log let me get rid of this then we try this before copying it in there we didn't get anything okay so maybe there is something wrong with this all right let me check them right next to each other multiple posts that question works it was that's crazy they're the same all right let me do this I'm gonna copy and paste this right here so it is going to search this let me save it just to see what we can get here so when we hit search okay all right what am I oh there is something different right yeah there's something different between the two of these what is it alright I'm checking the live chat now you have an extra s Chappell page it may mayor that you're right I do have the extra s but it looks like it looks like it works either way of those so I I mean at least in the browser it could work with or without the S yeah it works with or without the S okay so all right here's what I should be able to do I should be able to figure out at what point it stops being the same with like this there we go there it is admissions page instead of admissions pages let's see which one is admissions page all right so let's see come on ok so now we at least know that our our string here for the URL it does work in the browser so it's just not working here all right okay so yeah just to verify oops let's remove this yep and they are the same now okay so let's take this up and take this out well actually let me let me just go back there we are and admissions pages and chapel I'm an admissions page and Chapel page okay let's see all right cool hey Harsha what's up we're just get chase on defined let's see so get JSON we're bringing it in up here in utils folder so let's bring it up area get JSON you import isomorphic fetch is the Ito's fetch import correct yeah I don't all right let's let me look at this Aragon okay so we are attempting to make a get request right the import fetch from isomorphic fetch Narsingh expand get function are let me let me give you the the end rot link to in case you wanna check that out hey we got it to work okay cool alright let's put some of this data in here title rendered alright let's try to get a title rendered for each of these nikki says so what was the Tet the fix I alts have for a second I don't even know I don't know what I I think the problem was I kept searching for just some nonsense and so I was getting back an empty array and then when I search for a term that I knew would give a result then I got a result so I could let me yeah that was fetch failed fetch failed yeah actually it keeps telling me it failed no matter what but if you look at the network I get status 200 okay success true I don't I don't know what's happening here III don't understand all right well let's just display a little bit of this quickly so I don't have much time in this session so let me just go to go here and say oops um I don't need that I'm in the layout so let's see all right so I'm not talking cuz I'm just trying to get this done before the timer comes up so key items how to render okay okay cool there we go all right it works all right so I can't believe I got that in before the time ran out all right so here's here's what I did I just said if this state data exists then I want you to map over all the items so remember this state data is an array of objects so I want you to map over everything and then we just use an arrow function so it's going to be inside this map so for each item that's gonna represent a different object so I just did a div I put a key on there or else react complains that there's no key so I just use the ID and then since I'm used to using the WordPress API I knew exactly where this was which which helped so item title rendered gave us the data we needed so now when we search we get the titles so let's try it out with a different search term Chappell awesome so Chappell and students great so we're getting different search items based on that why are we only always getting ten all right I'll have to work on that but basically it worked we have a search function now we can't do that much with it but we have it and it works so awesome so now let me go back to where I was in the live chat where I left off that last time and I'm gonna go through I'm gonna go through all the rest of the questions mr. Tommy yeah I'm gonna go through all the rest if you have a question or comment please put in the live chat now and I will I'll get to everything in the live chat so the coding portion of this is pretty much over we depending on what questions are we may go back to the code and do a thing or two but for the most we're not gonna do a whole other point or a session of coding maybe tomorrow we'll go back to this and build out the UI and build out some of those filtering options because I want you to be able to be fill to filter this stuff like you're at amazon.com right I want users to be able to just narrowly filter everything to get exactly what they want so actually not I think about it that might be more than one more stream to make all that happen but about will probably work on it frog for the rest of the week and that's something else more important comes up Alexi says hello Jesse are you leveling up as a programmer I think I am I think I'm learning more every day so that's all we can do right just try to keep learning and and keep going what we can so yeah I guess I'm leveling up slowly but surely I don't know but you all let me know does it seem like I'm a better programmer now then a few months ago or or have I gone downhill in my past my prime yet Alexi says you look like a wizard with that beard cool I will I take that as a compliment I like the there's something relaxing about just being able to just stroke your beard like this my wife thinks it's weird she just laughs at me but it's fine and it does protect your face a little bit from the cold and from babies who try to grab your face and give you like battle scars like this one they go to grab your face instead they get a handful of beard so it's definitely functional as well as fashionable every shake says where you copying code from sorry I haven't been that involved with this whole process in the beginning oh okay Oh Annie he answered it already it's a good answer so Nicky says he's taking the code from a previous project he's done it's C I react on github yeah that is so on if you wanted to check out the project we are copying things from at the beginning it's CI react on the github repository that we work from so it's it's a what's it called organization repository so fu fu s marcom M AR CLM is the repository so my personal github is separate from that although I'm the the owner of the repository I guess yeah but you check out there and it's also project one in our series of videos so if you want to watch any of the videos when we first implemented that search function you could go back and check that out trying to think not all of my videos are titled well but I think I did put descriptive titles for that first project Aniki asks how does isomorphic fetch differ from regular fetch so isomorphic fetch so regular fetch works in the browser I mean assuming you have a newer browser where you can polyfill it isomorphic fetch works in on the server with with node so that's why we're using isomorphic fetch as well in kind of thing hmm so we probably didn't need to use it here because this is all happening clientside not serverside but the project where I copied it from we were actually making client and serverside calls not for the search but for loading some other data so that's why it was using isomorphic fetch so we didn't really need to do that but I mean it's nice to have that utility if we do need to use it you know we can use it serverside as well since we're using next we can use it in inside that that props would it lose that function called I can't remember is it props something what is it called and we're not using it here or we using this get initial props function that comes with neck so things in here will run server side and client side Raphael says good afternoon from Venezuela welcome thanks for watching Victoria says where is the past video tutorial help ok so we have a lot of other videos so there's a playlist on the free code camp YouTube channel called live coding with Jesse that has all the videos it's a lot of videos right now so I'm not really sure how you'd want to go about watching them I would say maybe just check out the titles and watch one of the videos that seems interesting to you based on the title also people have told me that it helps to watch the video at like 2 times speed and then just to slow it down if there's something you're really interested in and I'll recommend that I tried it as well I think the videos when you're watching the recording are much better at a faster speed it makes me look better because I type really fast and I talk really fast if you've set it on a faster speed let's see John says fetch and react is so much easier than jQuery AJAX call yeah I agree I think fetch is the easiest way to make Network requests Abhishek says fetch is polyfill for browsers which don't have fetch function it adds fetch function to your browser dice amorphic to your browser period isomorphic is implementation of fetch for both no GS and browser on top of the technical alright yeah exactly so Abhishek was answering the question about the difference between regular fetch and isomorphic fetch so that's exactly right the crap Pathan says I just got here what's so amazing Visual Studio code is amazing when what it where was it with debounce so if I hover over debounce it gives me all this information about the bounce it lets me know what it does and then it also says it recommends an article for me to get more information it gives me all the parameters that I could possibly use and it describes what they do it's really cool right it's right there I mean normally I just look it up on my other screen but being right there is really awesome michael says isn't that up to the author of the extension to write I'm guessing that that is the case I mean I I don't I really don't think Visual Studio code is going out and like searching for this so I'd imagine that's the case but either way it's really cool that this pops up and if it is the the author of this extension then good job on that thank you that's awesome feature John says with that revelation of amazing code feedback in BS code it looks like I may change my editor yeah I mean that that's a really nice feature alright was so there's a lot of conversation back and forth in a different alphabet than I use so I'm not gonna try to translate all of that if anybody wants to if any of those questions were directed to me then let me know but it's just a lot to go through and translate right now so I'm not I'm not gonna do that on the stream I might go after the stream and translate everything Michael earlier I mentioned that Michael had said that you could see my gray hair and my the latest video so I I didn't think I've talked about I didn't mention with the video was so I just went on an interview I interviewed for a position as a fullstack engineer and I did a video on my own YouTube channel which is linked in the description just explaining what the interview was like and then giving some of my thoughts and advice on coding interviews so if you're interested please check that video out and Michael says it wasn't as bad as or no wasn't it Michael says it was only a hair or two Nicky says not as bad as I thought was quite disappointed about that yeah so I don't have that much gray hair you can't really tell in these videos the resolutions not as high but the other video I did was a better camera and so you I guess you could tell they said the grey hair doesn't bother me then less hair on my head bothers me a lot more okay John says that the new bracket syntax for fragments does not yet work and create react okay good to know so I do have some projects that I haven't create react apps some of them we have using next so that's just something we're going to have to keep in mind if we use that to make sure we we think about okay what what are we using with this project will it work okay curious truth asks how much time should I put into CSS early on I actually really dislike it so I'm really having to force myself to work with it and inevitably end up procrastinating I would say and I'm gonna read out some of the answers as well but that others have given but I would say this depending on what you want to do CSS might not be that important for you if you really want to be a frontend developer you are gonna didn't need to know some CSS but you can get away with using some frameworks and focus more on JavaScript and you'll be okay with that and depending on where you work you may be able to get away with that even more if you want to do more of like backend or even be like full stack with a backend focus then you're probably safe to skip over a lot of CSS stuff and just do focus more on JavaScript so it just kind of depends on how much friend do you want to do and then what would job so I guess right now if CSS is holding you back from learning more you're fine to just focus more on JavaScript but if you start to have to have a job that you really wants and you need to use it of course you're gonna have to learn that but not every developer job are you even going to need to use CSS that much if they already have a style guide or certain framework that they use you may not even have a freedom to do very much with CSS so it may not be a big deal depending on who else you have on your team so if you if you're gonna do like freelance stuff and you're going to be expected to do everything on a project then you're gonna need to know CSS so in anyway hopefully that's a decent answer let's see what what everyone else said John says it depends on your goals what kind of developer you want to be CSS as part of the whole design and function process pretty important to have a fairly good understanding okay so also good answer okay so old sauce is explained a little bit about what what they are talking about and I wonder I'm not exactly sure what language that is like I don't want to know now but basically it was just someone asking about like what I was talking about so far okay it's Russian so it looked like Russian hm see Michael Michael put like a little like laughing crying emoji saying we'll be will rebuild Amazon search tomorrow yeah I didn't I didn't realize that when I said it but you're right that does sound ridiculous that I'm gonna do it just like Amazon say I'm not it wasn't my intention Amazon search is way too advanced for what we're gonna do it but we're we're gonna try to make our search more like Amazon search let's see hard should ask if I can test messaging in JavaScript AF which is one of our side projects yeah I could test the messaging and if Michael says the day after that we'll refine Google's algorithm alright jr. says hello from Africa from Senegal I love your live coding Oh awesome thanks for saying that thanks for watching that means a lot when when you all say things like that I appreciate it oh it's so harsh it is saying that most mature packages right those like this kind of thing now if it'll so that's really cool I'm gonna have to kind of try to do this more and hover over things and just see like what would extra info I think this is really useful it may be able to get like extra functionality out of things whereas normally I would just use what I I know and wouldn't take the extra time to look it up you know but this is so convenient you know I may be able to find a parameter that may give me a something better that's cool I like that world says you're only like 30 why do you have gray hairs already I don't know I'm 32 I don't know why like I'm losing my hair on the top and I have gray hair and my beard like what is I don't know what what's wrong with that it's like anyway yeah maybe it's the kids I do have four kids and so maybe maybe they cause my grade you know what it was I used to teach high school that's what did I'm convinced that's what did it I taught high school for like almost four years that must be it does that is teaching high school students is super stressful it's so stressful so I'm gonna blame it on that I mean maybe I could blame it on semicolons but now that I use you know standard style I don't have semicolons so I'm a lot more relaxed all right well I have made it to the end of the live chat horseshit I see I was just reminding me to test the messaging I will I will do my best to test the messenger okay so I'll be back tomorrow I don't think we have not we I don't think I have any meetings going on tomorrow so should be able to stream at the normal time and we'll be working on this search again and refining it a bit in the meantime I'm just going to be adding new things to our routing functions so you get more of the site accessible from the proper URLs and I'll be working on making sure all the data is formatted correctly in WordPress or as correctly as we can get it at this point so in the meantime if you have any questions you can always reach out to me on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or wherever else you can find me or comment in this video if you if you're interested at all in the interview process so I just went through please check out my youtube channel and watch the the latest video and so until tomorrow let's have a great day
