00:00 - the ternary operator
00:02 - the ternary or conditional operator is
00:04 - the only javascript operator that takes
00:06 - three operands
00:08 - this operator is basically a shortcut
00:09 - for the if statement it tests the
00:12 - condition and returns one value or
00:14 - expression if it is true and another if
00:16 - it is false so this is the the example
00:19 - so first there's a condition here and
00:21 - then you put a question mark
00:23 - and then you put if this condition is
00:25 - true it's going to return this first
00:27 - expression if it's a false after the
00:30 - colon here you're going to return the
00:32 - second
00:33 - thing let me just give you an example
00:35 - first i'll show you what it would look
00:37 - like with an if statement so we have
00:40 - var h equals 19
00:42 - if the age is more than or equal to 18
00:45 - console.log you are an adult else
00:47 - console.log you are a kid so let's run
00:50 - that and we'll see in the console it's
00:52 - saying you're an adult if we change that
00:54 - to 15 and we run that it's going to say
00:56 - you are a kid but there is a different
00:59 - way to do this with a ternary operator
01:09 - so this whole thing right here is the
01:11 - ternary operator first up here you can
01:14 - see the condition this part is the
01:16 - condition if age is more than equal to
01:18 - 18 then you always put the question mark
01:21 - if this is true it's going to
01:24 - print this you're an adult if it's false
01:26 - it's going to print you are a kid so
01:29 - um i'm going to clear the console and
01:31 - then run that again
01:32 - and you were a kid you were a kid so it
01:35 - prince that you were the kid from up
01:37 - here and then down here at princeton you
01:39 - are a kid so this is just a
01:42 - more succinct way of doing something if
01:44 - you just have a simple if else statement
01:46 - but you can also do more than one single
01:50 - operation per case separating them with
01:52 - a comma
01:53 - let me show you an example
01:55 - okay i just pasted this in here if we
01:57 - put another variable stop if the age is
02:00 - more than 18 here's the question mark so
02:03 - this part right here is the condition we
02:05 - have the question mark now this is this
02:07 - whole thing is the first expression
02:10 - after the question mark and you can see
02:11 - we have two statements we have
02:12 - console.log okay you can go and then
02:15 - there's the comma and then we assign
02:17 - stop stop equals false then you have the
02:20 - colon then you have the whole second
02:21 - expression here so before just one line
02:24 - but now it takes multiple lines and you
02:26 - can put the comma here to run two
02:28 - commands in there
02:30 - and the last thing i want to show you
02:32 - was that a ternary operation can be
02:34 - inside another ternary operation
02:37 - so let's scroll up here
02:40 - okay i'm just going to paste this right
02:41 - in there let me adjust this really quick
02:44 - so you can see this all so let's look
02:46 - through this we have a variable a var
02:48 - our first check equals false and then
02:51 - this is the second var second check
02:53 - equals false and then there's of our
02:55 - access now let's look through that we
02:57 - use a ternary operator to to show what
03:00 - access is so this is the condition first
03:03 - check so we're going to try to figure
03:05 - out what this access is going to equal
03:06 - so it first is going to check this first
03:08 - check equals false
03:10 - remember if it's true it goes to the
03:13 - first thing before the colon which is
03:15 - access denied if it's false it goes
03:18 - right after the colon which is this
03:20 - whole statement see after the colon
03:23 - there's a whole nother ternary operator
03:25 - because you can have more than one
03:26 - ternary operator together so now it's
03:29 - going to do this ternary operator it's
03:31 - going to do the second check well we can
03:33 - see that second check is false so if it
03:35 - was if this second check was true it
03:37 - would say access denied because but
03:40 - since it's false when we go after the
03:41 - colon again and it's going to be access
03:44 - granted now let's just check that by
03:46 - doing a console.log
03:57 - and you can see
03:59 - right at the bottom of the console we
04:00 - have access granted
04:03 - also from our previous thing we have
04:05 - sorry you are much too young with the
04:07 - much kind of cut off
04:09 - well thanks for watching my name is beau
04:11 - carnes check the description for a link
04:12 - to the code from this video
04:14 - and remember use your code for good

Cleaned transcript:

the ternary operator the ternary or conditional operator is the only javascript operator that takes three operands this operator is basically a shortcut for the if statement it tests the condition and returns one value or expression if it is true and another if it is false so this is the the example so first there's a condition here and then you put a question mark and then you put if this condition is true it's going to return this first expression if it's a false after the colon here you're going to return the second thing let me just give you an example first i'll show you what it would look like with an if statement so we have var h equals 19 if the age is more than or equal to 18 console.log you are an adult else console.log you are a kid so let's run that and we'll see in the console it's saying you're an adult if we change that to 15 and we run that it's going to say you are a kid but there is a different way to do this with a ternary operator so this whole thing right here is the ternary operator first up here you can see the condition this part is the condition if age is more than equal to 18 then you always put the question mark if this is true it's going to print this you're an adult if it's false it's going to print you are a kid so um i'm going to clear the console and then run that again and you were a kid you were a kid so it prince that you were the kid from up here and then down here at princeton you are a kid so this is just a more succinct way of doing something if you just have a simple if else statement but you can also do more than one single operation per case separating them with a comma let me show you an example okay i just pasted this in here if we put another variable stop if the age is more than 18 here's the question mark so this part right here is the condition we have the question mark now this is this whole thing is the first expression after the question mark and you can see we have two statements we have console.log okay you can go and then there's the comma and then we assign stop stop equals false then you have the colon then you have the whole second expression here so before just one line but now it takes multiple lines and you can put the comma here to run two commands in there and the last thing i want to show you was that a ternary operation can be inside another ternary operation so let's scroll up here okay i'm just going to paste this right in there let me adjust this really quick so you can see this all so let's look through this we have a variable a var our first check equals false and then this is the second var second check equals false and then there's of our access now let's look through that we use a ternary operator to to show what access is so this is the condition first check so we're going to try to figure out what this access is going to equal so it first is going to check this first check equals false remember if it's true it goes to the first thing before the colon which is access denied if it's false it goes right after the colon which is this whole statement see after the colon there's a whole nother ternary operator because you can have more than one ternary operator together so now it's going to do this ternary operator it's going to do the second check well we can see that second check is false so if it was if this second check was true it would say access denied because but since it's false when we go after the colon again and it's going to be access granted now let's just check that by doing a console.log and you can see right at the bottom of the console we have access granted also from our previous thing we have sorry you are much too young with the much kind of cut off well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes check the description for a link to the code from this video and remember use your code for good
